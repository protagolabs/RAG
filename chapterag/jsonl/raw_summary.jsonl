About 33 more nuclear power plants of equal size to Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Arizona would be required with 24 hours of operation each day to generate that amount of electricity.\nAVs have the potential to reduce GHG emissions {tuple_delimiter} Researchers found that AV technologies can significantly reduce GHG emissions (Duan et al., 2020; Fakhrmoosavi et al., 2022; Gonzalez-Gonz ´ alez ´ et al., 2019; Le Hong & Zimmerman, 2021). CAVs, SAVs, and on-demand mobility options can further reduce emissions by lowering the number of engine start, energy consumption, and vehicle ownership (Coulombel et al., 2019; Wadud & Anable, 2016). The integration of EVs and SAVs presents an added potential to sharply reduce emissions.

{"doc_id": 486, "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md", "summary": "The document outlines assumptions and methodologies used in a life cycle assessment (LCA) of electric vehicles (EVs).  Here's a breakdown of the main arguments and supporting evidence:\n\n- **Argument One:** The LCA considers varying lifetime mileage based on regional driving patterns. {tuple_delimiter} - Supporting Evidence: For instance, the US is assumed to have a lifetime activity of 330,000 km, while India has an assumed activity of 260,000 km.\n- **Argument Two:** The LCA incorporates mileage decay, emphasizing near-term emissions impact. {tuple_delimiter} - Supporting Evidence: It assumes the highest annual mileage occurs in the first year, decreasing to around 95% of the previous year in subsequent years.\n- **Argument Three:**  The LCA uses a sales-weighted average battery chemistry (NMC811) and energy density for its calculations. {tuple_delimiter} - Supporting Evidence: This reflects current market trends and assumes a 30% increase in energy density by 2035, with 20% of cathode material sourced through recycling.\n- **Argument Four:** The LCA utilizes regional groupings from the Global EV Outlook and EV data explorers for its analysis. {tuple_delimiter} - Supporting Evidence: These groupings categorize countries based on geographical regions like Africa, Asia Pacific, Central & South America, Europe, etc.\n\n{completion_delimiter} \n\n\n"}
