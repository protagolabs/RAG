{"doc_id": 1, "text": "Urban Mobility Planning: Challenges & Solutions\n\nAround 4.4 billion people - more than half of the world’s population - live in urban areas today. Cities are denser than ever before, yet urbanization continues to increase. By 2050, 58% of the world’s population will be living in cities, and by 2100 it will be 85%.\n\nThis global trend spells new challenges for urban mobility planning. With technological advancements, the way people and goods move around is changing. From e-scooters to ride-sharing apps, urban mobility planning is becoming more complex than ever.\n\nSo how can governments and city planners meet the demands of urbanization? In this article, we will cover the biggest urban mobility challenges and the solutions needed to overcome them.\n\nWhat is urban mobility planning?\n\nUrban mobility is about getting people from where they are to where they need to be within metropolitan areas at different times throughout the day, ideally in the most efficient manner.\n\nThis incorporates the length of the journey from point A to point B, the length of time spent in transit, and the type of transportation used—whether it be personal vehicles, buses, trains, ride-share cars, or bicycles.\n\nUrban mobility planning refers to the strategic approach of planning and mapping mobility routes in order to maximize transit efficiency within cities.\n\nThe goal of urban mobility planning is to determine the best way to reduce congestion and the environmental impact without adding to current transit times.\n\nWhy is urban mobility planning important?\n\nUrban mobility planning is essential for the ongoing operation of modern society. This is because it facilitates the ability for individuals to go to work, purchase goods and services, attend to healthcare needs, socialize, and live their daily lives.\n\nWhile there has been a simultaneous shift towards digitization, which has reduced some daily mobility demands, maintaining an online presence hasn’t replaced the physical realm of the world.\n\nAs these urban areas continue to grow, the stress placed on current transportation systems will increase. Efficient urban mobility is required to address these challenges and to support a growing population while allowing both the transportation of goods and people to move freely, quickly, and reliably using affordable transportation solutions.\n\nWhat are the top urban mobility challenges?\n \n\nIncreasing urban populations\nIn 2007, the number of people who live in urban areas overtook the number residing in rural communities. With over 4 billion people - half of the world’s population - living in metropolitan areas, urban mobility is becoming a major challenge. As these cities turn into megacities that house over 10 million residents, the problems become harder to ignore. \n\nThe higher the population, the more significant the complexity and strain on the existing transportation infrastructure. Without impactful change, the increasing population poses a looming threat to urban mobility.\n\nClimate change & decarbonization of mobility\nMore and more countries and cities are aiming to reduce their carbon emissions in order to tackle climate change. Some cities have introduced low carbon areas, where access is restricted to vehicles with high carbon emissions.\n\nLow carbon mobility solutions like e-scooters, e-buses, and bike-sharing programs are also emerging to curb climate change and help decarbonize mobility solutions. Whilst these alternative mobility solutions are great at combating climate change, they add another layer of complexity when it comes to urban planning.\n\nDemand for accessible mobility\nAccessibility and quality of life are becoming more important than ever for urban populations. Therefore, urban mobility planning is not only about improving the overall capacity. Instead, it’s about finding solutions that are environmentally sustainable, improve social equity, and are economically viable for everyone.\n\nAir pollution\nIssues arise when urban mobility planning fails to offer the efficient alternatives needed to accommodate personal vehicle use. The more cars that are on the road, the more congestion that occurs, which causes major disruptions and delays in the lives of residents.\n\nIn some cities across the U.S., commuters waste an average of 199 hours a year stuck in traffic. These hours add up over time and lead to inflated vehicle emissions.\n\nCongestion in cities leads to air and noise pollution, risking public health and reducing overall quality of life. Through effective urban mobility planning unnecessary traffic and congestion could be avoided.\n\nAging infrastructure\nOne of the most complex urban mobility challenges is the aging infrastructure of many cities worldwide. The public transportation systems were built to accommodate much smaller populations and haven’t been updated accordingly over the years.\n\nAging infrastructure not only increases the risk of road accidents, however, it’s becoming more costly than ever to maintain old infrastructure.\n\nIncreasing online deliveries\nThe boom in online shopping has reduced the requirements for individual urban mobility, but it’s also increased the number of commercial deliveries. These urban freight operations are a major contributor to urban mobility congestion. As consumer demand for next-day delivery increases, it presents a challenge to last-mile delivery solutions.\n\nHow can we improve urban mobility planning?\nDigital Technology.", "filename": "1.txt"}
{"doc_id": 2, "text": "Advancements in technology can address problems with urban mobility in the digital age. By adopting digital tools, urban mobility plans can become more effective in offering sustainable transportation that addresses the growing congestion problem.\n\nSome of the ways that digital technology can improve urban mobility planning include:\n\nUser Experience: The ability for public infrastructure to process real time data on transportation needs. This not only decreases logistical issues, but it can also help inhabitants save time and money while drastically improving the overall user experience of public transportation options.\n\nEfficiency: With technology such as AI-enabled infrastructure, individuals and businesses can map out efficient paths through urban areas and avoid congestion. Moreover, smart cameras can detect congestion hotspots and inefficiencies in transportation systems in general.\n\nSafety: The process of integrating technology to transform densely populated urban areas into smart cities improves safety. Real time data communication supports the use of smart roads, smart cars, smart traffic lights, and more. This system is one that supports autonomous cars, which further reduces the risk of fatal accidents caused by human error.\n\nAir taxis and other future innovations.\n\nAs inner-city populations proliferate, transit demands continue to grow. While several urban mobility solutions can be implemented within current systems, disruptive technologies of the future may create interesting opportunities.\n\nVertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft, for example, has become the newest interest as they are being dubbed ‘autonomous air taxis.’\n\nAir taxis and other future innovations with similar technology have the potential to negate the problems we currently experience with land-side transport services. Future urban mobility solutions like these have the potential to revolutionize the way the public navigate densely populated megacities around the world.\n\nHow effective urban mobility planning can be part of the solution\nWhile there are individual solutions through digital technology and future innovations, it’s necessary to have an urban mobility plan in place that addresses issues as a whole.\n\nThrough specialist urban mobility planning tools, cities can plan their transportation systems to enhance road safety, improve mobility and reduce the environmental impacts.\n\nFor example, it’s now possible to forecast and design urban mobility systems using a digital twins of cities approach. This enables city planners to simulate and analyze different transportation solutions to see their effect on urban mobility challenges.\n\nVirtually simulating these solutions avoids wasting city resources on ineffective projects or infrastructure changes. Digital twins are a virtual testing-ground for strategic urban mobility planning.\n\nWhich public sectors benefit from urban mobility planning?\n\nEnvironmental Services\nOptimized roads lead to reduced air and noise pollutants. Moreover, planning for future mobility can help decarbonise transportation and thus reduce carbon emissions.\n\nLaw Enforcement\nUrban mobility planning can help city planners improve road safety and reduce accident hotspots. In effect, this reduces the resources required by law enforcement agencies to respond to accidents.\n\nHealth\nLess congestion in urban areas means less air pollutants and as a result, less risk to public health. Moreover, health services, such as doctors, ambulances, or pharmacy deliveries can reduce their time stuck in traffic.\n\nInfrastructure\nEffective planning ensures infrastructure is upgraded to meet future capacity before it’s too late. Using urban mobility planning tools can also help in the design and development of new infrastructure projects by modeling different outcomes on traffic.\n\nTrade and Commerce\nAs traffic flow improves with effective urban mobility planning, so does the flow of goods traveling through a city. Furthermore, shops and businesses become more accessible, making urban mobility planning an economic-benefit.\n\nTransportation\nWith the use of professional road infrastructure modeling, transportation agencies can manage current transportation needs and plan for future challenges.", "filename": "1.txt"}
{"doc_id": 3, "text": "Infrastructure technologies: Challenges and solutions for smart mobility in urban areas\n\nSmart mobility solutions can transform city living and improve quality of life—but are difficult to implement at scale. A collaborative, ecosystem approach could be the way ahead.\n\nTraffic jams, long commutes, noise, and pollution have become major blights on urban life. As the global population grows and becomes increasingly urbanized, these problems are likely to escalate. Already, 56 percent of the world’s population live in cities; by 2050, nearly seven in ten people will do so.1 Even cities without projected population growth grapple with transport volumes that put pressure on urban space and infrastructure.\n\nBy leveraging technology to manage existing transport infrastructure efficiently, cities can protect or build back neighborhoods to ensure they remain vibrant spaces. Several forward-thinking cities are looking at ways to ease road congestion, decrease emissions, and safeguard neighborhoods and green spaces—thereby improving quality of life. Hundreds of projects have been designed to enhance transport systems at city level around the world, as explored in McKinsey’s report Urban transportation systems of 25 global cities. Such projects include developing public-transport infrastructure, digitizing transport-system processes, and expanding pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.2 For example, the city of Amsterdam—that made the strategic decision to reduce the use of private cars as far back as the 1970s—is now planning to implement mobility hubs that integrate different transport modes with shared mobility options such as electric bikes or scooters.3 And the city of Paris plans to add 180km of segregated bicycle lanes and triple the number of bike parking spots throughout the city.4\n\nSolving for urban mobility is a pressing challenge, and a highly complex one, as it involves multiple transport modes—including road infrastructure and public transport networks—and a diverse set of stakeholders such as governments, municipalities, city councils, and service providers. What’s more, what works in one city may not work in another. Solutions are often city specific and bespoke which means that they are difficult to replicate and scale. Moreover, the application and protection of the equity principle, requiring the transport system to provide all the population with the same level of access without any discrimination, is of foremost importance when addressing mobility challenges.\n\nThis article examines recent trends affecting urban mobility, and highlights the digital technologies and infrastructure advances that can respond to these trends to address the issues that many cities face. It also details the key challenges of implementing technologies and innovations at scale—keeping in mind that the process of connection and/or data exchange between infrastructures and users must comply with local privacy and data protection regulations that change according to specific geographies. As there is no one-size-fits-all solution, the article concludes by providing case examples that could help stakeholders to identify the best way forward for their specific context.\n\nThree inter-related trends are shaping the urban mobility landscape\nCities enable social interaction and spur innovation. As a result, they are an integral part of the global economy—generating more than 80 percent of global GDP. Consequently, the urban road network is an essential enabler of economic growth and access to services. But density and urban sprawl put pressure on resources. Cities represent two-thirds of global energy consumption and account for more than 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.5 Given the transport network’s size, any sustainability-related changes have significant potential to reduce emissions, pollution, and congestion.\n\nHowever, traffic systems are becoming more complex to orchestrate. Three major trends are shaping the urban mobility ecosystem.\n\nTraffic volumes are increasing\nOECD projections indicate that total demand for urban passenger transport will more than double by 2050, compared to 2015.6 Additionally, recent COVID-19-related changes in consumer habits have posed significant challenges on urban roads, specifically the increase in last-mile delivery vehicles as a consequence of the e-commerce boom.\n\nAs transport infrastructure capacity becomes more constrained, and traffic volumes increase, stakeholders may have to prioritize road safety awareness, and accident reduction. And as consumer preferences continue to influence delivery patterns, infrastructure may need to be adjusted to accommodate freight and single-parcel delivery option such as electric vehicles, e-scooters, and e-bikes.", "filename": "2.txt"}
{"doc_id": 4, "text": "New mobility paradigms have emerged\nShared mobility, and electric and autonomous vehicles have disrupted urban mobility. Depending on customer acceptance of shared mobility, regulations in each country, and the progress of technology, spending on shared-mobility services could reach $500 billion to $1 trillion in 2030.7 In parallel, the future of the automotive industry is looking increasingly electric, due to shifting consumer behavior, ongoing improvements in battery and charging technologies, and regulatory moves.8 For instance, the Advanced Clean Cars II regulations mandate that all new passenger cars, trucks, and SUVs sold in California will be zero emissions by 2035.9 As far as autonomous vehicles are concerned, consumers may want cars with more advanced autonomous functions (including L2+, L3, and L4) which give the autonomous system greater control. L3 and L4 systems for driving on highways will likely be commonly available in the private-passenger-car segment by around 2025 in Europe and North America, although steep upfront costs may limit such advances to premium vehicles.10\n\nThese developments have implications for urban mobility infrastructure ecosystems. Growing use of shared mobility services, with the associated increase in fleets of these modes, has added to congestion. Transport infrastructure will likely become more constrained as space will have to be allocated for electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) and parking facilities dedicated to micro-mobility and/or shared mobility.\n\nGreater attention, and public funding, is being focused on sustainability and decarbonization\nThe transport sector is responsible for around one quarter of global energy-related CO2 emissions.11 And McKinsey estimates that more than half of transportation emissions are generated by passenger cars.12 Governments and institutions around the world are setting decarbonization goals, for example, the European Union aims to be climate neutral by 2050, an objective at the heart of the European Green Deal, in line with commitments to the Paris Agreement.13 The US government set the same goal, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050.14 Businesses, too, are embracing decarbonization. Currently, more than 4,000 companies are working to reduce emissions by setting science-based targets and commitments.15 Given the role transport plays in emissions, these shifts have significant implications for urban mobility.\n\nAs these trends unfold, cities are growing and evolving, and their citizens’ needs are changing: Livability and quality of life will become increasingly important and shifting consumer preferences may shape the cities of the future. McKinsey research indicates that leading cities expand transport networks and infrastructure, and provide good road networks, bike lanes, and pedestrian infrastructure. Furthermore, increasing the number of dedicated public-transport lanes, optimizing bus routes, completing road construction or modernization projects, and implementing digital upgrades all help improve the commuter experience in such cities.16\n\nMost importantly, as more people switch to new transport paradigms, there will be a greater need to collaborate, coordinate, and synchronize decision making and visibility across the transport ecosystem. The need for coordination already exists—many cities face a pressing need to manage vehicle flows, as well as volumes of pedestrians and cyclists, that make up urban life.\n\nInfrastructure technologies already provide the tools and solutions to address urban mobility challenges\nAdvances such as the Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing create a mix of connectivity in cities that can enable solutions for reshaping the urban mobility landscape. Several actors from different industries have invested in mobility digitalization and new technologies. The range of business across the mobility value chain include established technology companies, systems integrators, tech and mobility startups, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), digital platforms, providers of software and hardware components, and payment companies.\n\nIn this context, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), urban congestion charging, and Mobility-as-a-Service (Maas) platforms are among the most advanced systems and solutions currently in development:\n\nITS refers to systems in which technologies are applied in the field of road transport—including infrastructure, vehicles, and users—and in traffic management and mobility management.17 For ITS to work, both hardware and software components are needed. Hardware includes IoT devices like road-side units, sensors, detection cameras, controllers, traffic lights, and toll booths. Examples of software include packages that enable advanced traffic management, environmental traffic management, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, adaptive traffic control, advanced traffic planning and simulations, and data analytics.\n\nITS can play a significant role in improving road safety, reducing congestion, optimizing transport efficiency, enhancing mobility, and reducing energy use and environmental impacts. A European Commission report found that the largest cumulative socioeconomic benefits of ITS include reduced travel times and increased efficiency (66 percent), reduced accident rates (22 percent), and fuel consumption savings (11 percent).18 Furthermore, ITS can help to smooth mobility demand at peak hours and provide a way to optimize freight transport through better capacity management.", "filename": "2.txt"}
{"doc_id": 5, "text": "Urban congestion charging mechanisms work thanks to digital cameras that are able to identify license plates and classify vehicles in urban areas. By surcharging or restricting private car access to congested areas—typically city centers—regulators aim to reduce traffic congestion and improve other recurring issues, like air quality and noise pollution.\n\nMaaS platforms combine urban transport modes and services—for example, public transport, shared mobility services, urban rail services, and parking facilities—by leveraging data and information to integrate planning, booking, payment, and customer-service processes. Municipalities, transport companies, technology startups, and payment companies have been investing in MaaS due to the dual benefits for passengers and urban areas. Consumers benefit from superior transparency over travel options and pricing, with all transport offerings available ad hoc on a smart phone. Cities benefit from better traffic flows and overall improvements in a transport system that also incentivizes environmentally friendly alternatives.\n\nThese three technologies are often implemented in conjunction with other initiatives or urban architecture projects such as developing dedicated lanes for public transport or bicycles, establishing restricted access areas, or enforcing on-street parking payments. Even though these technologies act as fundamental enablers for solving urban mobility challenges and boosting cities’ livability, their implementation at scale is struggling to take off.\n\nWhy it’s challenging to implement technologies at scale\nImplementing technologies at scale is a complex and challenging process because: i) there are multiple stakeholders involved as transport system upgrades by nature involve the overlap and integration of multiple layers and components; and ii) each initiative is project-based and not fully scalable to other cities.\n\nThe issue of mobility is managed by many actors, each with different objectives, budgets, sources of funding, and legacy technology (see sidebar, “Stakeholders in the urban mobility environment”). Communication and coordination across these stakeholders can be difficult and may pose challenges to implementation.\n\nInternational examples show that urban mobility projects are often unique and cannot be directly replicated and scaled. Indeed, cities require tailor-made solutions. Needs vary according to factors such as the maturity level of the system already installed, the budget allocated for the project, and targets to be achieved. A solution that works in one city is difficult to replicate or scale to others as it was designed to solve specific challenges in a particular context.\n\nIn addition, solutions for smart mobility depend on the mix, and integration, of multiple layers—and each component has to be adapted to local standards and tech protocols. Elements include hardware and IoT devices, software to collect and synthetize data from multiple sources, and third-party providers who install and maintain the hardware and software. Furthermore, any solution will likely need to be compatible with all kinds of legacy applications that are still in operation.\n\nAdopting an ecosystem approach provides a way to achieve scale\nDue to the complexity of urban mobility systems, and the required interconnection of multiple stakeholders, an ecosystem approach can increase the chances of success when implementing digital technology at scale. In this approach, every actor plays a critical role in successful implementation and the resulting impact.\n\nAny change in one area is likely to affect all others. Actors need to work together, across the mobility ecosystem, to upgrade existing public transport systems and road infrastructure, and make traffic more fluid—ultimately increasing people’s quality of life.\n\nIn the spirit of broadening the debate about how to design and implement smart urban mobility solutions, the following seven examples of real-world challenges and how cities solved them can shed light on how new technologies and an ecosystem approach can lead to positive outcomes.\n\nEmbrace a forward-looking approach when tendering ITS solutions\nA private operator committed to installing nearly 3,000 traffic controllers to upgrade the traffic-detection infrastructure in Miami-Dade County in Florida. This initiative is part of a seven-year partnership between the private operator and Miami-Dade County, an example of combining global and local expertise.19\n\nBoost green forms of transport without causing adverse effects on road traffic\nCopenhagen invested in ITS by installing new controllers in traffic signals at the city’s intersections. This new technology enabled the city to control traffic and optimize signals in real time, resulting in more efficient flows of bikes and buses and reduced accidents. ITS will help Copenhagen to achieve its vision to have 75 percent of all the trips in the city be by bike, public transport, or on foot by 2025.20\n\nIdentify solutions to shave-off traffic peaks during rush hour\nLondon and Singapore successfully implemented congestion pricing mechanisms to reduce traffic congestion in city centers during rush hours. After the first year of operation, the solution deployed in London led to a 15 percent reduction in traffic during charging hours.", "filename": "2.txt"}
{"doc_id": 6, "text": "Additionally, traffic delays were cut by 25 percent, travel speeds increased by 30 percent, and bus reliability and journey time improved.21 Similar outcomes were achieved in Singapore: The country’s electronic road pricing scheme launched in 1998 led to a 24 percent reduction in vehicles a day during weekdays, and a 30 percent increase in average speed.22 Singapore is currently implementing the second generation of a road pricing scheme that allows for dynamic pricing on individual road segments over the course of a day. In February 2023 the electronic road pricing rates were adjusted in response to traffic conditions observed throughout the previous month.23 This system will help to smooth traffic peaks, optimize use of road capacity, and support a shift from private cars to public transport.\n\nFavor the implementation of Maas platforms\nThese platforms that allow travelers to purchase tickets for multiple transport options through a single app are tailored to local contexts. One example is the Jelbi app launched by Berlin’s public transport authority, BVG, and the technology company Trafi. Another example is Whim app that provides access to urban modes of transport in some cities in Finland, Belgium, Japan, Switzerland, Austria, and the UK. Local urban transit operators can play a critical role in orchestrating the implementation of MaaS platforms by coordinating mobility players in the area.\n\nAchieve the “15-minute city”\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo is one of the most prominent champions of the 15-minute city concept where residents’ needs are easily satisfied and are within reach by a 15-minute cycle or walk. Some squares in Paris have been upgraded with more room for pedestrians. Other areas have been repaved with new bicycle lanes. As a consequence, some roads saw triple the number of cyclists. The Mayor has promised to reduce the number of parking spots by 2024, and involve private operators to use smart-city technologies to make car and truck traffic more efficient.24\n\nExtract the highest value from Application Programming Interface (API) to orchestrate urban mobility\nThe Oregon Department of Transportation is designing a cloud-based connected vehicle ecosystem that leverages moving vehicle data and public-agency data. The resulting data-sharing hub is intended to deliver safety and mobility applications over the network and via roadside units using cellular V2X technology.25\n\nTake an integrated approach\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration is currently rolling out an integrated corridor management (ICM) program that takes into account the fact that traffic conditions on one roadway will affect traffic conditions on adjoining or alternate roadways as well as other modes of transport. In this context, managed lane strategies, alternative routing of traffic, and proactively controlling traffic within freeway corridors are useful approaches that can increase utilization levels of existing roadway capacity, improve travel times, enhance safety, and increase travel reliability.26\n\nAll in all, when designing or implementing an urban mobility system that leverages new technologies, an ecosystem approach can improve its chances of success. City authorities could play a critical role in facilitating the process with relevant stakeholders and orchestrating overall implementation. All stakeholders need to understand the new mobility models available and the impact that they can have, and technology providers could make all stakeholders aware of these products and systems.\n", "filename": "2.txt"}
{"doc_id": 7, "text": "Transportist: MaaS or SaaM: Mobility-as-a-Service Pro and Con\n\nThe concept of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) involves integrating various transport services, such as public transport, ride-hailing, car-sharing, and bike-sharing, into a single, “user-friendly” platform, (an app) typically with a monthly subscription for the bundle of pre-defined services. The goal is to provide a seamless, multi-modal transport experience, reducing the need for multiple subscriptions, multiple apps, and more broadly reducing the number of personal vehicles and vehicle kilometres travelled.\n\nIs this likely to be here in 10 years time, or is it another example of faddism in the transport sector, as people look for solutions that don’t require real political pain (like pricing and taxing policies)? With the assistance of ChatGPT (which is to say, everything that was published before 2021 online compressed into a massive neural network) I (we?) formulate the case in favour and against. Here is what we came up with.\n\nThesis: MaaS-tering the Future: The Case for Mobility-as-a-Service\nMaaS has been gaining traction as a potential solution to address the transport challenges faced by rapidly urbanising populations. Despite some concerns about its sustainability, there are compelling reasons to believe that MaaS can revolutionise urban transport and provide significant benefits to users, cities, and the environment.\n\nEnhanced User Experience and Convenience: One of the main advantages of MaaS is its ability to offer a superior user experience. By integrating various transport options, such as public transit, ride-hailing, car-sharing, and bike-sharing, MaaS platforms enable users to plan, book, and pay for their trips using a single app. This seamless experience can make public transport more appealing and encourage a shift away from private vehicle ownership.\n\nReduced Traffic Congestion and Parking Pressure: MaaS has the potential to significantly reduce traffic congestion and parking pressure in urban areas. By encouraging the use of shared and public transport options, MaaS can decrease the number of single-occupancy vehicles on the roads, thereby reducing traffic jams and the need for parking spaces.1 As a result, cities can repurpose parking spaces for other uses, such as green spaces or pedestrian zones, improving overall urban liveability.\n\nEnvironmental Benefits: MaaS can contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution by promoting a shift from private vehicle use to more sustainable modes of transport. By integrating options like electric bikes, scooters, and electric vehicle-sharing services into the MaaS ecosystem, the platform can encourage users to adopt low-emission transport alternatives, reducing the overall environmental impact of urban transport.\n\nImproved Accessibility and Equity: MaaS platforms can improve transport accessibility and equity by offering a wide range of mobility options that cater to diverse user needs. By including services such as wheelchair-accessible vehicles, discounted fares for low-income users, and user-friendly interfaces, MaaS can help ensure that urban transport systems are more inclusive and accessible to all.\n\nEconomic Benefits and Job Creation: MaaS can stimulate economic growth and job creation by fostering innovation within the transport sector. The development of new services, technologies, and infrastructure to support MaaS can create employment opportunities in research, engineering, data analytics, and customer service. Additionally, MaaS platforms can help optimize the use of existing transport resources, leading to cost savings for cities and transport providers.\n\nAntithesis: SaaM: Service-as-a- Mirage - The Inevitable Demise of Mobility as a Service\nMaaS has emerged as a potential solution to address the ever-growing transport challenges in urban environments. However, despite its seemingly progressive nature, there are several factors that indicate MaaS may be more of a Service-as-a-Mirage (SaaM) than a sustainable solution.\n\nInadequate Infrastructure and Integration: A major challenge in implementing MaaS is the lack of adequate infrastructure and integration among transport providers. Many cities are still grappling with outdated infrastructure, which is ill-equipped to support the high-tech requirements of MaaS. Additionally, the need for seamless integration among various transport services is crucial, but is often hindered by competition and lack of standardisation.2\n\nMonopolisation and Lack of Competition: One of the significant risks associated with MaaS is the potential for monopolisation. As larger companies seek to dominate the market, they may buy out or outcompete smaller providers. This lack of competition could lead to higher prices and reduced innovation, ultimately undermining the very principles that MaaS was intended to promote.\n\nData Privacy and Security Concerns: As MaaS relies heavily on user data, the issue of data privacy and security comes to the forefront. Users need to trust that their personal information, location data, and payment details are secure. However, with high-profile cases of data breaches and misuse of user information, it is increasingly difficult to guarantee that MaaS platforms can maintain privacy and security standards.", "filename": "3.txt"}
{"doc_id": 8, "text": "Environmental Impact: Although MaaS is often touted as an environmentally friendly solution, its overall impact on the environment is uncertain. The increased use of ride-hailing services, for example, can contribute to greater congestion and emissions. Additionally, the production and disposal of electric scooters and bikes used in shared mobility services can generate significant waste and pollution.\n\nUnsustainable Business Models: Many MaaS providers rely on venture capital funding to stay afloat, as they have yet to establish sustainable revenue streams. As investors eventually seek returns on their investments, these services could become unaffordable for the average user or cease to exist altogether, leaving consumers with fewer transport options. Remember, none of these services were profitable before bundling, why would they be profitable after?\n\nSynthesis: MaaS Hysteria: Navigating the Traffic Between Utopian Dreams and Gridlock Realities\nMy view is that Visa and Mastercard and their ilk will come to play and put out-of-business all these specialised payment systems that public transport use. That will help. The problem then gets down to the Business Model. As none of the components are profitable now, it will require public subsidy. Will the subsidy be larger for these programs? How are they going to be tailored?\n\nOne assumes a monthly subscription program looks like this:\n\nUnlimited Public Transport.\n\nUnlimited Bike Sharing.\n\nX Car shares per month of under W hours.\n\nY Taxi/Uber riders per month of under Z km.\n\nWill this bundle be better for consumers than the current pay-as-you-go (and in many places there already are Season Tickets for public transport)? Y taxis will cost some amount of money. If I use less than Y per month now, I risk overpaying for the subscription (or will take unnecessary taxi trips (substituting taxi for public transport, walking, or bike sharing to maximise value). If I use more than Y, the subscription might be a bit of a discount, but I will still have to pay for the overages (hopefully no worse than standard fare now — but who knows, look at your Mobile Phone data plans — especially if you live in the United States — to see how tricky this is, and how pissed consumers get).\n\nThe idea is to encourage members to forego vehicle ownership, a step function change, that will be better in the long run for society, so some subsidy may be warranted. But I look at the Opal+ plans that my local public transport service provider, TfNSW, offers, and it is extremely unappealing. If you are not very careful, and very certain of your travel plans, you pay more than you would now — the current fares are fairly generous, and if you take more than 8 trips per week, subsequent trips are half fare, and there are off-peak discounts. (I know I would have paid more under this plan, so didn’t sign up). The agency apparently wasn’t willing to give up any revenue to induce more usage.", "filename": "3.txt"}
{"doc_id": 9, "text": "What to Expect From Autonomous Vehicles in 2024\nFrom self-driving cars to autonomous trucking, key trends to keep an eye on over the next 12 months\n\nWhen it comes to hyperbole, the autonomous vehicle (AV) arena takes some beating. \n\nWe have become accustomed to regular, wildly optimistic – but inaccurate – predictions from Tesla’s Elon Musk, for example, that driverless cars are just around the corner.\n\nThe turbulence of recent months, meanwhile, has seen the rise of an exaggerated pessimism following the travails of self-driving taxi company Cruise, stripped of its license to operate in California, its leadership team and arguably its reputation following an ill-advised response to an accident in San Francisco.\n\nThe driverless car experiment has “failed miserably” lamented one skeptic, while even Cruise’s new boss Mo Elshenawy admitted the General Motors subsidiary was at an “all-time low” as it faces massively reduced investment.\n\nViewed with a sense of perspective, however, the reality of the AV landscape lies somewhere in between these two extremes as we enter 2024. \n\nSo, what can we expect from automated and autonomous vehicles over the next 12 months?\n\nOn the passenger car front, the most notable development is – subject to regulatory approval – likely to be the widening of availability of Level 3 driver assistance tech packages, already offered by Mercedes on select models in Germany as well as California and Nevada. \n\nRelated:Cruise Self-Driving Taxi Operations Suspended in California\n\nLevel 3, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, offers highly automated “hands-off, eyes off’ driving, and other automakers are set to follow suit. BMW has already announced that Level 3 will be offered on the 7 Series in Germany, and the new Polestar 4 coupe-SUV has been developed to deliver this functionality, too.\n\nThe Rise of Chinese Automakers\nAnother key trend to keep an eye on will be the continued rise of Chinese automakers, both in China and on a global basis.\n\nXPeng’s highly advanced Navigation Guided Pilot driver assistance tech – which works on both highways and cities – will be available China-wide by the end of 2024, and the company has made no secret of its plans to launch in more markets across the world.\n\nExpect to hear more from ZEEKR, too, which has developed the SEA-M platform that facilitates Level 4 functionality – full self-driving capability in specific locations (although we’re unlikely to see regulatory approval for this on passenger cars for quite some time).\n\nSEA-M’s most interesting application may well be the purpose-built self-driving taxi that ZEEKR is co-developing with Waymo, which is scheduled to undergo a major testing program in 2024, prior to commercial launch. Its arrival is now even more eagerly anticipated, particularly given that production of Cruise’s Origin self-driving cab has been suspended indefinitely.\n\nRelated:Automated Driving Spreads to More Chinese Cities\n\nAmid a self-driving taxi landscape where Cruise maneuvered from ambitious expansion plans to a self-inflicted implosion in a matter of months in 2023, predicting what might happen in 2024 with any degree of confidence is difficult. \n\nBut probable scenarios include a continued cautious rollout from Waymo in more metropolitan areas across the U.S. and a muted, low-key return for a significantly trimmed down Cruise in a location sympathetic towards AV testing – possibly Texas or Arizona – rather than its previous San Francisco hub.\n\nFurther afield, China’s recent issuing of nationwide guidelines for robotaxi regulation is only likely to encourage big players such as Baidu and WeRide to extend their operations, and the latter’s recent award of a testing license in Singapore – the fourth country it is now active in – underlines a desire to expand globally that will only gain momentum in 2024.\n\nAutonomous Trucking\nIn the autonomous truck world, meanwhile, the key development may well be a significant ramp-up in driverless testing of heavy-duty long-haul vehicles. Already underway in China and Japan, America has lagged behind somewhat (despite a brief foray in 2021 by the now-departed TuSimple). Kodiak, for one, has plans in place to start driverless trials in 2024.

Kodiak, for one, has plans in place to start driverless trials in 2024.\n\nRelated:California Senate Passes Bill to Ban Driverless Trucks\n\nThere will also be a keen interest in whether these initial autonomous trucking operations and pilots move out of their heartland in the southern United States, now that Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed California’s proposed autonomous trucking ban. Industry insiders suggest there may be good news with regard to testing in the Golden State in 2024.", "filename": "article1.txt"}

{"doc_id": 11, "text": "Parliamentary Passage\nThe Act passed through parliament without any significant hitch or delay, likely due to the consensus surrounding the need to signal to prospective AV manufacturers and operators the UK's intent to introduce self-driving technologies.\n\nThat being said, some amendments have been made, most notable of which are (additions in bold): \n\nSection 2(2) – Statement of Safety Principles – the principles must now also be “framed with a view to securing that authorised automated vehicles will achieve a level of safety equivalent to, or higher than, that of careful and competent human drivers”.\nSection 2(4) – Statement of Safety Principles – requiring the Secretary of State, in preparing the statement, to consult organisations that appear to them to represent the interests of AV manufacturers, road users, and road safety.\nOther changes have been made since its introduction to the House of Lords in November 2023, but these mostly relate to less substantive points such as where the money from fines goes to, and dealing with how secondary legislation is passed (via affirmative and negative procedure).\n\nImportance of the Act\nThe Act has seven parts, each briefly summarised below:\n\nRegulatory Scheme: Establishes principles and a framework for licensing self-driving vehicles; introduces the concept of an authorised self-driving entity (ASDE), who is the person that will be legally responsible; provides for the implementation of ‘no-user-in-charge’ (NUiC) vehicles; and finally, enforcement and sanctions. You can read more about this in our previous article here.\nCriminal Liability: Defines ‘user-in-charge’ (UiC), and then outlines their liability and circumstances in which they will benefit from immunity; also adds AV-specific offences.\nPolicing and Investigation: Grants powers to stop and seize AVs; also introduces ‘automated vehicle incident inspectors’, whose chief function will be to identify factually the cause of incidents.\nMarketing Restrictions: Criminalises misuse of terminology that implies self-driving capabilities (both via a prescribed list and ‘terms likely to confuse’ road-users). You can read more about this in our previous article here.\nAutomated Passenger Services Permits: Empowers authorities to grant permits; also exempts AVs from otherwise applicable taxi legislation. You can read more about this in our previous article here.\nAdapting Existing Regimes: Enables the Secretary of State to amend ‘type approval legislation’; also extends vehicle examiners’ powers to AVs, including allowing them to prohibit one from driving.\nGeneral Provisions: Defines terms, and confirms scope across England, Wales, and Scotland.\nFor a more detailed overview of the seven parts to the Act, see our initial commentary here.\n\nTimeline for implementation\nWhilst regulation of the technology has been nascent for many years, with the Act and incoming secondary legislation to give effect to the Act’s framework, regulation is now on the move in a positive direction which will be welcomed by those in the industry.\n\nThat being said, some of this legislation will take time to take effect. On the Act’s return to the House of Lords on 8 May, Lord Davies noted that the secondary legislation would be launched in ‘the coming months’, building the new regulatory framework ‘piece by piece’. By way of time estimates, Lord Davies provided the following (in order of priority):\n\nRegulations on misleading marketing – consultation to commence later this year.\nDigitising traffic regulation orders – consultation to commence in the Autumn, with the aim of the legislation coming into force in Spring 2025.\nInitial work on the Statement of Safety Principles to begin this year – plan is to consult on this in 2025.\nDetailed regulations establishing authorisation, operator licensing and in-use regulation functions will follow later.\nComment\nIt will be of some assurance in an election year that the Act was passed with broad cross-party consensus and that there was alignment on the need to swiftly follow with work on secondary legislation, albeit there was a range of views expressed on approach (e.g. Bill Esterson MP (Shadow Roads Minister), in the Act’s passage through the Commons, argued in favour of an advisory council to implement the secondary legislation).\n\nOverall, the passing of the Act is much-welcomed by the industry – largely due to it providing the much called for certainty that industry requires to press forward with their AV roll-out plans in the UK with confidence.", "filename": "article2.txt"}
{"doc_id": 12, "text": "How Dubai is tackling the challenges of autonomous vehicle development\nAmid regulatory concerns and technological difficulties, the pace of autonomous vehicle (AV) development has slowed in recent years. Entrepreneurs need access to the right facilities and support to facilitate the future of driverless transport.\n\nForms of vehicle autonomy have existed since the mid-1990s with the introduction of adaptive cruise control (ACC), which could control the acceleration and deceleration of a car in response to the movement of a vehicle in front. In the 21st century, technology has developed well beyond this ‘Level 1’ autonomy, with 2023 seeing the first Level 3 vehicles from Mercedes-Benz hit the roads.\n\nEquipped with optical sensors and radar, this new generation of AVs can operate independently for a period, allowing the driver to take their eyes off the road until instructed to regain control. Looking to the future, Level 4 AVs, which can drive completely independently within a conditioned environment, and Level 5 AVs, able to operate anywhere without supervision, are no longer remote possibilities.\n\nHowever, the timeline for the general adoption of these vehicles has expanded in the face of technological and regulatory issues. GlobalData research predicts that, due to the current experimental nature of most prototypes, global sales of Level 4 and Level 5 AVs in 2030 are now expected to number only 250,000 units. However, within another decade this is predicted to rise to 4 million. There also remain concerns over the dangers posed by driverless vehicles after several high-profile accidents. AV projects need to be tested in the right environments and scaled with care if they are to be implemented more widely in the next few decades.\n\nEnsuring the safety and compliance of AV technology\n\nThe greatest challenge currently facing AV development is a hostile regulatory environment and a lack of public trust, following fatal accidents caused partly by small failings in the autonomous systems involved.\n\nAccording to Sammy Chan, manager, Automotive Sales Forecast at GlobalData: “Even after accumulating millions of miles of AV driving experience technological progress advances relatively slowly, while setbacks are often severe and can derail a company’s quest towards fully autonomous driving.”\n\nRegulatory frameworks need to be in place to facilitate AV testing in a greater variety of driving conditions to prevent further accidents. The Level 3 Mercedes-Benz S-Class, launched last year, is only allowed to use its features on stretches of specific roads, for example a portion of motorway in Germany. Regulators across the globe, from the USA to the EU to Singapore, are currently adopting a cautious approach, although permission has been granted for vehicles without drivers in specific locations for testing purposes.\n\nDubai’s plans to scale AV capabilities\nHowever, road systems and weather conditions can vary wildly from country to country, let alone from street to street. Deploying Level 4 and above AVs will be impossible without appropriate testing in diverse environments and the right regulatory frameworks. Dubai has become the first city in the Middle East to trial robotaxis, with the emirate deploying five fully autonomous electric taxis on a stretch of roads in the Jumeriah district in September 2023. The Dubai Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) plans to roll out 4,000 self-driving cars across the city by 2030 and anticipates that a quarter of all journeys within Dubai will be autonomous by that same year.\n\nBut testing AVs in safe, urban districts is one thing; planning for the implementation of AVs across the world in a variety of environments is another. “Millions of autonomous driving miles have been amassed by the leaders in this space, but most of this has been in relatively safe operation environments, so it is not possible to extrapolate even successful tests to other more challenging locations,” Chan points out.\n\nDubai is unique compared to other cities in the US and China that have tested AVs because of its desert climate. Understanding how AVs cope under the heat of an Arabian summer adds a further interesting dimension to the trial, alongside training AVs to operate in countries with different road systems and cultures. To improve the safety of all road users, it is key that the cars learn to recognise pedestrians that might be dressed differently from other countries, for example women in hijab.\n\nMeanwhile, Dubai Silicon Oasis (DSO), an economic zone affiliated with Dubai Integrated Economic Zones (DIEZ), is helping advance AV technology even further. September 2023 saw DSO host the Dubai World Congress for Self-Driving Transport, focused on developing autonomous buses. $2 million in prize money was shared between the promising startups King Long and BrightDrive, and a further $100,000 to students from Heriot-Watt University for their innovative ideas.", "filename": "article3.txt"}
{"doc_id": 13, "text": "Preparing for the autonomous vehicles of the future\nAVs are currently powered by computer vision, sensors, and 3D imaging, but there is the potential for their capabilities to be enhanced even further through the incorporation of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology. LiDAR can offer higher-resolution images and process data more quickly across a wider range of environmental conditions. However, it is also extremely expensive and bulky, making its incorporation into AVs more difficult.\n\nFor the next generation of Level 4 AV capabilities to be unlocked, it is essential that the right ecosystems are in place to support innovation in the industry. Businesses based in DSO not only benefit from the DIEZ Venture Capital fund, Oraseya Capital, to finance their ideas, but a collaborative network of entrepreneurs and world-leading facilities for living and working too. With ample space for testing new projects in a safe environment, and the support of a forward-thinking government seeking to implement autonomous technology in a considerate way, DSO is tackling key challenges to enable a future driven by AVs.", "filename": "article3.txt"}

It’s a technology that is sometimes difficult to comprehend. \n\nHowever, in recent times, news on fully autonomous vehicles has gone quiet. In this blog, we explore the current developments regarding autonomous vehicles and what we should expect for the future. \n\nTapered Expectations\nBack in 2016, Business Insider predicted that by 2020, there will be ten million self-driving cars on the road. From a 2024 perspective, I don’t blame them for making this prediction. \n\nAt the time, all the signs suggested autonomous vehicles were just around the corner. \n\nSince 2016, it’s been a disappointing eight years for self-driving cars. They’ve become entwined in a series of legislative red tape concerning safety and reliability. \n\nThe State of Autonomous Vehicles\nNow, in 2024, autonomous vehicles have gone pretty quiet. You hear a murmur here or there, but big news regarding self-driving vehicles is kept on the down low. \n\nThis is because the technology is facing massive challenges, such as: \n\nEthical\n\nThis big challenge facing autonomous vehicles is safety. Ultimately, the technology relies on machines making split-second decisions to keep us and other road users safe. So, who’s at fault if something goes wrong? Is it the car manufacturer? The software programmer? Or the car itself? \n\nThere is no clear and right answer to this question. Governments from across the world have different viewpoints, which is tricky for those developing autonomous cars. \n\nSome people argue the best thing to do is let the car make an impartial decision. \n\nLegal \n\nAutonomous vehicles are a relatively new phenomenon, and consequently, regulations vary greatly from country to country. This makes it difficult for companies to develop self-driving cars internationally. For example, in China, the government is pushing for rapid advancement of autonomous vehicles, while in Germany, they are developing rigorous frameworks that are cautious but supportive of autonomous innovation.\n\nConsumer hesitancy\n\nAnother challenge for autonomous vehicles is whether humans will actually use the technology. For nearly a century, humans have gotten behind the wheel and driven the car themselves, and as we’re creatures of habit, it will be hard to change this. \n\nThis consumer hesitancy is being caused by fears about job losses, especially in the transportation sector, and concerns about trusting a machine to drive your vehicle. \n\nRecent Breakthroughs\nIn the last couple of years, the different levels of automation have become apparent. Level 4 is the level at which a human is no longer needed, but that’s clearly difficult to achieve. \n\nLevel 2, which uses Advanced Driving Assistance Systems, and Level 3, which has conditional automation, have increased in popularity. Mercedes-Benz introduced Level 3 conditionally in the US in January 2023, with Nevada the first state to authorise. \n\nWe’ve also seen a number of driverless taxi fleets increase in number, but this has been issued a setback after a woman was trapped under a self-driving taxi in San Francisco. \n\nIt’s clear the technology still has a way to go, but things are looking positive. In December 2023, Mark Harper, the British Transport Secretary, said: \n\nConclusion\nAutomation undoubtedly has a future in the automotive industry, but I’m still not convinced how widespread it will become. If the technology overcomes its significant hurdles, the consumer will benefit massively. \n\nHowever, drivers will still want to be able to take control of their vehicle if needs must. The industry must find a safe, reliable, and interactive balance. ", "filename": "article4.txt"}
{"doc_id": 15, "text": "The impact of autonomous vehicles on urban planning\nSelf-driving vehicles (Connected Autonomous Vehicles or CAVs), along with electrification and sharing, will revolutionise how people travel by road in the future. In this paper, Associate Director Luke Kendall examines how the design of urban areas will need to respond to the introduction of CAVs, and with some urgency.\nThe current situation\n\nAutomation already exists in a limited form in public and private transport, from driver-assisted cars to automated systems such as the Dockland Light Rail system in London. CAVs, however, are a step change.\n\nIn recent years in the UK, we have started to see a shift away from private car ownership, although there are regional differences. This has in part seen an increased move to public transport but more significantly micro-mobility such as cycling and scootering, a trend that is set to continue as people prioritise their health and the environment. Click here to read more about the cycling boom.\n\nWe also know that electric vehicle (eVs) adoption in the UK is gradually accelerating. 66% more eVs were registered in 2020 than in 2019, and in September 2021 eVs made up 23.1% of new car registrations[i]. What is detracting from wider adoption is that cost in the UK of electric vehicles is around 1.3 x that of a conventional car while in other some European countries it is on a par. In the UK there are fewer charging points, and of these only 3% are ultra-fast change points, compared with 12% in Germany and 25% in China[ii]. You can find out more about street charging by reading our related article here.\n\nWhat are the benefits of Autonomous Vehicles?\n\nAn AV trip can be shared - Driverless cars could collect people from around the same locality or be shared between employees.\nReduced cost - The removal of the cost of a driver from driverless taxi/Uber-type services.\nReduced number of vehicles - Several studies suggest that the introduction of CAVs could lead to as much as a 90% reduction in vehicle need. There are likely to be fewer, but harder working, vehicles on the road, leading to decreased congestion and increased road space.\nIncreased access for individuals with disabilities, older people and children - A larger part of the population will be able to take part in daily mobility.\nPeople will be willing to take longer trips - People will be less reliant on living close to their places of work or education. They can use their journey time more effectively for work, reading, or even just family time.\nIncreased safety - CAVs will, in theory, be better driven leading to reduced road incidents. ‘Mobility corridors’ can be created to be shared with pedestrians and cyclists. A mobility corridor is where different modes of transport are brought closer together to share a common route without the need for separation in levels and design. Read our paper about rebalancing the streets for more on this, including an emerging Dutch model.\n\nWhat will be the impact on urban planning?\n\nOur urban environments have suffered from too many cars chasing too little space.\n\nA host of measures have been introduced to discourage or restrict the use of the private car, including regulation (such as congestion charging) and physically and financially prioritising alternative modes of transport.\n\nWe can assume that we will need to devote less space to CAVs for driving, parking and manoeuvring. This will allow us to use more of the public realm for other uses, say, soft landscaping. Urban grids can therefore be narrower, allowing for more intimate spaces, and shaded through the proximity of adjoining buildings.\n\nDrop off and pick up zones.\n\nWith AVs will come the desire to be dropped off at the door rather than finding a parking space and walking to the destination. Ad hoc drop-offs (like how a taxi operates now), can add to congestion if sensible locations are not provided. So, while some space may be reclaimed, some may still be required. We may see subterranean car parks retained as pickup and drop-off locations as well as being repurposed to accommodate the increase in other modes of micro-mobility.\n\nCAVs would need fewer parking facilities as they would not need to sit idle. They could carry out trips for others or tasks such as click and collect pickups.\n\nCurrent studies[iv] suggest that we could see as much as a 70% reduction in parking demand in towns and cities. This will require a significant rethinking of our development requirements and regulations and will shift land value.\n\nWhat about commercial vehicles?", "filename": "article5.txt"}
{"doc_id": 16, "text": "Most studies focus on the impact on private cars and public transport. But there will also be consequences for commercial vehicles. If we can assume for a moment that delivery vehicles will not require an operative (a person) for loading and unloading, then cost will be reduced. Even if we assume someone is required for loading, the removal of the driver potentially increases safety. Deliveries could be better scheduled outside busy hours at more unsociable times and completed with more accuracy.\n\nThe logistics sector is already starting to introduce AVs for mail, parcel and even food deliveries. It is hoped the eVTOLs (electric devices with Virtual Take-off and Landing) for people and goods will further ease ground-level congestion, although ground-level deliveries are with us for the foreseeable future.\n\nPlatooning, or driving close together in a group, is something that has so far generally been considered for truck movements outside urban areas. It is possible that the principle could be applied to some areas of our urban network as individual vehicles start to aggregate together.\n\nHow Chapman Taylor is responding to the challenge\n\nAVs will be adopted, and CAVs, or at least voiceless with this ability, will be adopted in parallel. The recent acceleration of change suggests adoption is likely to be quicker than anticipated - more like a 10-year window. As designers, we are therefore going to be increasingly asked to consider the accommodation of CAVs.\n\nIn the short to medium term, we are considering the challenge of how to repurpose parking structures, particularly when they are integral to a property. We have already been considering this due to the reduction in private cars accessing town centres. We are exploring repurposing, rather than redeveloping, as this is a more sustainable way of retaining a high embodied carbon structure. Uses we have considered to date include workplace, residential, retail, play and recreational spaces, leisure and hydro or aeroponic farming.\n\nThe need for less parking space and the potential for more space-sharing, such as in ‘mobility corridors’, may reinvigorate the design of our public realm as we move away from the dominance of the private internal combustion car.\n\nAdoption of CAVs is likely to be contained or frustrated by the ability and flexibility of our streets to accommodate them during a period of transition. At Chapman Taylor we are planning for this now.", "filename": "article5.txt"}
{"doc_id": 17, "text": "Autonomous Driving: The Steps to Self-Driving Vehicles\n\nAutonomous driving is no longer a distant vision of the future. But how close are we to this long-anticipated dream? And what exactly does the term mean? Experts divide the automation level of vehicles and their driving functions into six levels.\n\nThe vehicle moves as if guided by ghost hands and safely chauffeurs its passengers through confusing city traffic, on the country road, and at high speeds on the highway. Meanwhile, the occupants are working on the laptop, reading or closing their eyes. There is no human driver, nor a steering wheel or a pedal. In recent years, we have come close towards this vision of self-driving vehicles. In the meantime, vehicles are on the road, in some cases without human drivers as a back-up, in test situations, on defined routes or defined areas.\nFully autonomous vehicles operating in mixed traffic will become established in the foreseeable future. But according to experts it will take a few more years. Until then, vehicles with different levels of automation will be on the road. The six automation levels of vehicles and their driving functions are described in the SAE International J3016-Standard.\nLEVEL 0: NO DRIVING AUTOMATION\nIn principle, the automotive pioneers were already driving in this manner. Simplified: The driver steers, brakes and accelerates without the support of assistance systems. In fact, there are a few electronic helpers that, according to the SAE definition, can occur under Level 0, such as active safety systems like Electronic Stability Control (ESC) or Emergency Brake Assist (AEB), since they only support in certain situations. The \"non-automated\" vehicle is being phased out.\nDriver: Complete control.\n\nLEVEL 1 - DRIVER ASSISTANCE\nThe driver is still fully responsible for the driving task and must always pay attention to traffic, encompass the steering wheel, and be ready for braking. However, advanced assistance systems are at driver´s disposal. When driving assisted, the assistance systems support either steering and braking or accelerating, either laterally or longitudinally, but not simultaneously. For example, Level 1 includes either a lane keeping assist (LKA) or an adaptive cruise control (ACC) with which the vehicle regulates the speed and its distance from the vehicle in front. The driver can override them at any time or even switch them off (if and on/off control is available). These advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are already available in almost all vehicle classes. ZF also offers a multitude of them.\nDriver: Is fully responsible for longitudinal and lateral guidance, is supported in specific cases.\n\nLEVEL 2 - PARTIAL DRIVING AUTOMATION\nThe most important difference to Level 1: The advanced driver assistance systems can now control the longitudinal and lateral dynamics at the same time. If, for example, lane keeping assist and ACC are combined in one system one speaks of level 2. ZF goes a little further and offers so-called Level 2 + systems for passenger cars. For Level 2+, various advanced driver assistance systems are intelligently interconnected and thus help to increase safety and comfort. However, the responsibility for everything the vehicle does remains solely with the driver. Drivers must monitor the system at all times, touch the steering wheel regularly, and be able to intervene immediately if necessary. Writing messages on the smartphone behind the steering wheel during driving remains taboo.\nDriver: Must constantly monitor the system.\n\nLEVEL 3 - CONDITIONAL DRIVING AUTOMATION\nIt's a big leap from level 2 to level 3. From this stage onwards, the vehicle temporarily takes over the driving task from the driver. The human driver does not have to monitor the system constantly, and may pursue other activities within certain limits. When the systems reach their limits, the driver must be able to intervene at any time - after a warning period. Germany has already created the legal requirements for highly automated systems in 2017. Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz is the first manufacturer that got the approval for a level 3 system in passenger cars. Since 2022, the first vehicles with the system will roll over German highways, albeit initially only in the case of slower traffic or traffic jams. After all, the allowance is valid up to 60 kilometers per hour. In these situations, the driver may legally use the cell phone, watch movies, or participate in a video meeting. However, he must be able to intervene after a warning period. In the current case, this is 10 seconds. Sleeping behind the steering wheel, for example, stays taboo at level 3.\nDriver: May occasionally engage in non-driving activities.", "filename": "article6.txt"}
{"doc_id": 18, "text": "LEVEL 4 - HIGH DRIVING AUTOMATION\nThe big difference to Level 3: The vehicle operates completely autonomously under certain conditions. The human being no longer has to be ready to intervene. He can work, watch movies and even sleep. And the vehicle may also drive alone, i.e. without occupants. It must be able to reach a safe state without the intervention of a human driver, i.e. to come to a standstill in a parking lot for example. However, the autonomy of the vehicle at Level 4 is still linked to certain conditions, such as a defined route, driving on the highway or in the parking garage. Numerous companies are already testing level 4 vehicles in road traffic. Since 1997, ZF shuttles have been operating fully automated in various projects worldwide on segregated lanes. Legally, Germany has created the framework for \"autonomous motor vehicles (up to level 4) in defined operating areas within public road traffic in regular operation\" as the first country worldwide.\nDriver: No longer has to be ready for intervention.\n\nLEVEL 5 - FULL DRIVING AUTOMATION\nFor Level 5, the autonomy of the vehicle is no longer subject to conditions. In contrast to Level 4, a Level 5 vehicle acts completely autonomously. The vehicle can drive anywhere in road traffic and under all conditions without human beings. Consequently, these vehicles do not require a steering wheel or a gas or brake pedal. A human driver no longer exists at this stage. They are turning into a passenger.\nDriver: Does not exist anymore. The human being becomes a passenger.", "filename": "article6.txt"}
{"doc_id": 19, "text": "An Overview of Autonomous Sensors – LIDAR, RADAR, and Cameras\n\nFrom the pages of science fiction books to our roads, autonomous vehicles are becoming a reality. Most modern self-driving cars are currently capable of certain automated driving tasks, such as lane keeping and adaptive cruise control, and technology is progressing rapidly toward full automation.\n\nWhile it can seem magical to those less technologically minded, the mystery of automation is a result of advanced sensors that provide real-time data about the environment to the vehicle’s onboard computer, which processes the data and makes decisions about how to control the vehicle.\n\nSensors are critical components of any advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS).  They determine the quality of data put into the system, and therefore the quality of autonomous decision-making. There are a number of different types of sensors available, each of which uses a different technology to provide information about the vehicle environment.\n\nLight Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR), and cameras are the most common sensors used in ADAS and in this article we will be taking a look at each of these.\n\nLet There be Light: The Use of LIDAR in Autonomous Vehicles\nLIDAR uses laser light to detect and measure distances between objects. There are different types of LIDAR technologies available, but in general, each of them emits laser pulses that bounce off objects in the environment and return to the sensor, allowing the system to create a 3D map of the environment.\n\nThe most common types of LIDAR used in the autonomous vehicle industry include:\n\nTime of Flight (ToF) LIDAR uses a laser pulse. \nFrequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) LIDAR uses a continuous laser beam. \nScanning LIDAR uses a rotating laser beam. \nFlash LIDAR uses a single laser pulse.\n \n\nEach has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of LIDAR sensor depends on the specific requirements of the autonomous vehicle application. Manufacturers may also use a combination of different LIDAR sensors to achieve the desired level of performance and reliability. \n\nIn general, LIDAR sensors are highly accurate, making them ideal for self-driving vehicles. They are also effective in low-light conditions and can accurately detect objects in rain, fog, and snow. However, LIDAR sensors are relatively expensive, and they can be affected by some environmental factors, such as dust and smoke.\n\nRiding Those Radio Waves: The Case for RADAR Sensors in Autonomous Technology\nLIDAR and RADAR operate off similar principles but RADAR technology uses radio waves to detect the presence and location of objects rather than light. The RADAR sensor emits a radio signal that bounces off objects in its path, and the sensor then receives the reflected signal. By analyzing this signal, the RADAR can determine the location, speed, and direction of detected objects and this information can in turn be used to predict their future movement and trajectory.\n\nRADAR can transmit and receive signals over longer distances than LIDAR, making it useful for detecting objects at greater ranges.\n\nThere are several other advantages to using RADAR in autonomous vehicles. RADAR can operate in a wider range of weather conditions compared to LIDAR and cameras – an important feature given that vehicles have to operate in all types of unpredictable weather conditions. RADAR is also less expensive than LIDAR, making it a cost-effective option for many applications.\n\nOn the downside, RADAR sensors have lower resolution capabilities than LIDAR or cameras which can make it more difficult to identify small objects or distinguish between similar objects. Another limitation is that RADAR can be affected by interference from other RADAR systems, which can reduce its accuracy.\n\nAnd Action! The Role of Cameras in Driverless Technology\nCameras are the most familiar type of sensor to most people. They capture images or video of the environment which can be used to detect and identify objects, such as pedestrians, other vehicles, traffic lights, and road signs. \n\nRegular single-lens or monoscopic cameras capture a 2D image which does not provide depth information about the objects in the scene – a distinct disadvantage for automated vehicle applications.\n\nIn order to overcome this limitation while still retaining all the other benefits of camera sensors, stereoscopic cameras have become a popular solution. These sensors make use of two lenses placed a fixed distance apart to capture two slightly different images of the same scene. These two images are then combined to create a 3D representation of the scene, providing more accurate depth information about the objects in the environment. \n\nOverall, cameras are a critical component of autonomous and ADAS systems.\n\nThey are relatively inexpensive and have high-resolution capabilities, making them a popular choice for self-driving cars. However, cameras have limitations, particularly in low-light conditions, and they can struggle to accurately identify objects at long distances. ", "filename": "article7.txt"}

In December 2020, Waymo was the first to offer rides in self-driving taxis to the public in limited geographic areas (SAE Level 4),[7] and as of April 2024 offers services in Arizona (Phoenix) and California (San Francisco and Los Angeles). In June 2024, after a Waymo self-driving taxi crashed into a utility pole in Phoenix, Arizona, all 672 of its Jaguar I-Pace were recalled after they were found to have susceptibility to crashing into pole like items and had their software updated.[8][9][10] In July 2021, DeepRoute.ai started offering self-driving taxi rides in Shenzhen, China. Starting in February 2022, Cruise offered self-driving taxi service in San Francisco,[11] but suspended service in 2023. In 2021, Honda was the first manufacturer to sell an SAE Level 3 car,[12][13][14] followed by Mercedes-Benz in 2023.[15]\n\nHistory\nMain article: History of self-driving cars\nExperiments have been conducted on advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) since at least the 1920s.[16] The first ADAS system was cruise control, which was invented in 1948 by Ralph Teetor.\n\nTrials began in the 1950s. The first semi-autonomous car was developed in 1977, by Japan's Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory.[17] It required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds of 30 km/h (19 mph) with the support of an elevated rail.[18][19]\n\nCarnegie Mellon University's Navlab[20] and ALV[21][22] semi-autonomous projects launched in the 1980s, funded by the United States' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987.[23] By 1985, ALV had reached 31 km/h (19 mph), on two-lane roads. Obstacle avoidance came in 1986, and day and night off-road driving by 1987.[24] In 1995 Navlab 5 completed the first autonomous US coast-to-coast journey. Traveling from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 98.2% of the trip was autonomous. It completed the trip at an average speed of 63.8 mph (102.7 km/h).[25][26][27][28] Until the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence, controls, and sensor systems.[29]\n\nThe US allocated US$650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System,[30] which demonstrated automated driving, combining highway-embedded automation with vehicle technology, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and highway infrastructure. The programme concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997.[31] Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, Navlab drove 4,584 km (2,848 mi) across the US in 1995, 4,501 km (2,797 mi) or 98% autonomously.[32] In 2015, Delphi piloted a Delphi technology-based Audi, over 5,472 km (3,400 mi) through 15 states, 99% autonomously.[33] In 2015, Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, Michigan, and Washington DC allowed autonomous car testing on public roads.[34]\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, the European Commission funded development for connected and automated driving through Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT programs.[35] The Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.[36]\n\nIn November 2017, Waymo announced testing of autonomous cars without a safety driver.[37] However, an employee was in the car to handle emergencies.[38]", "filename": "wiki.txt"}

Robocar reached 282.42 km/h (175.49 mph).[43]\n\nIn March 2021, Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with Level 3 \"Traffic Jam Pilot\" driving technology, which legally allowed drivers to take their eyes off the road when the car was travelling under 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph).[12][13][44][14]\n\nIn December 2020, Waymo became the first service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public, in a part of Phoenix, Arizona. Nuro began autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.[45] DeepRoute.ai launched robotaxi service in Shenzhen in July 2021.[46] In December 2021, Mercedes-Benz received approval for a Level 3 car.[15] In February 2022, Cruise became the second service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public, in San Francisco.[11] In December 2022, several manufacturers scaled back plans for self-driving technology, including Ford and Volkswagen.[47] In 2023, Cruise suspended its robotaxi service.[48] Nuro was approved for Level 4 in Palo Alto in August, 2023.[49]\n\nAs of August 2023, vehicles operating at Level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor;[citation needed] as of early 2024, Honda leases a Level 3 car in Japan, and Mercedes sells two Level 3 cars in Germany, California and Nevada.[50][51]\n\nDefinitions\nOrganizations such as SAE have proposed terminology standards. However, most terms have no standard definition and are employed variously by vendors and others. Proposals to adopt aviation automation terminology for cars have not prevailed.[52]\n\nNames such as AutonoDrive, PilotAssist, Full-Self Driving or DrivePilot are used even though the products offer an assortment of features that may not match the names.[53] Despite offering a system ot called Full Self-Driving, Tesla stated that its system did not autonomously handle all driving tasks.[54] In the United Kingdom, a fully self-driving car is defined as a car so registered, rather than one that supports a specific feature set.[55] The Association of British Insurers claimed that the usage of the word autonomous in marketing was dangerous because car ads make motorists think \"autonomous\" and \"autopilot\" imply that the driver can rely on the car to control itself, even though they do not.\n\nAutomated driving system\nAn ADS is an SAE J3016 level 3 or higher system.\n\nAdvanced driver assistance system\nMain article: Advanced driver-assistance system\nAn ADAS is a system that automates specific driving features, such as keeping the car within its lane, cruise control, and emergency braking. An ADAS requires a human driver to handle tasks that the ADAS does not support.\n\nAutonomy versus automation\nAutonomy implies that an automation system is under the control of the vehicle rather than a driver. Automation is function-specific, handling issues such as speed control, but leaves broader decision-making to the driver.[56]\n\nEuro NCAP defined autonomous as \"the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident\".[57]\n\nIn Europe, the words automated and autonomous can be used together. For instance, Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 supplied:[58]\n\nAccording to SAE J3016,\nSome driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.\n\nOperational design domain\n\nOperational design domain (ODD) is a term for a particular operating context for an automated system, often used in the field of autonomous vehicles. The context is defined by a set of conditions, including environmental, geographical, time of day, and other conditions. For vehicles, traffic and roadway characteristics are included. Manufacturers use ODD to indicate where/how their product operates safely. A given system may operate differently according to the immediate ODD.[60]", "filename": "wiki.txt"}
{"doc_id": 23, "text": "The concept presumes that automated systems have limitations.[61] Relating system function to the ODDs it supports is important for developers and regulators to establish and communicate safe operating conditions. Systems should operate within those limitations. Some systems recognize the ODD and modify their behavior accordingly. For example, an autonomous car might recognize that traffic is heavy and disable its automated lane change feature. [61]\nVendors have taken a variety of approaches to the self-driving problem. Tesla's approach is to allow their \"full self-driving\" (FSD) system to be used in all ODDs as a Level 2 (hands/on, eyes/on) ADAS.[62] Waymo picked specific ODDs (city streets in Phoenix and San Francisco) for their Level 5 robotaxi service.[63] Mercedes Benz offers Level 3 service in Las Vegas in highway traffic jams at speeds up to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).[64] Mobileye's SuperVision system offers hands-off/eyes-on driving on all road types at speeds up to 130 kilometres per hour (81 mph).[65] GM's hands-free Super Cruise operates on specific roads in specific conditions, stopping or returning control to the driver when ODD changes. In 2024 the company announced plans to expand road coverage from 400,000 miles to 750,000 miles.[66] Ford's BlueCruise hands-off system operates on 130,000 miles of US divided highways.[67]\n\nSelf-driving\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists defined self-driving as \"cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or 'driverless' cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.\"[68]\n\nThe British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines a vehicle as \"driving itself\" if the vehicle is \"not being controlled, and does not need to be monitored, by an individual\".[69]\n\nAnother British government definition stated, \"Self-driving vehicles are vehicles that can safely and lawfully drive themselves\".[70]\n\nBritish definitions\nIn British English, the word automated alone has several meanings, such as in the sentence: \"Thatcham also found that the automated lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety, going on to say they cannot, therefore, be classed as 'automated driving', preferring 'assisted driving'\".[71] The first occurrence of the \"automated\" word refers to an Unece automated system, while the second refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle. British law interprets the meaning of \"automated vehicle\" based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle \"driving itself\" and an insured vehicle.[72]\n\nIn November 2023 the British Government introduced the Automated Vehicles Bill. It proposed definitions for related terms:[73]\n\nSelf-driving: \"A vehicle “satisfies the self-driving test” if it is designed or adapted with the intention that a feature of the vehicle will allow it to travel autonomously, and it is capable of doing so, by means of that feature, safely and legally.\"\nAutonomy: A vehicle travels “autonomously” if it is controlled by the vehicle, and neither the vehicle nor its surroundings are monitored by a person who can intervene.\nControl: control of vehicle motion.\nSafe: a vehicle that conforms to an acceptably safe standard.\nLegal: a vehicle that offers an acceptably low risk of committing a traffic infraction.\n\nSAE classification\nA six-level classification system – ranging from fully manual to fully automated – was published in 2014 by SAE International as J3016, Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems; the details are revised occasionally.[76] This classification is based on the role of the driver, rather than the vehicle's capabilities, although these are related. After SAE updated its classification in 2016, (J3016_201609),[77] the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) adopted the SAE standard.[78][79] The classification is a topic of debate, with various revisions proposed.[80][81]\n\nClassifications\nA \"driving mode\", aka driving scenario, combines an ODD with matched driving requirements (e.g., expressway merging, traffic jam).[1][82] Cars may switch levels in accord with the driving mode.", "filename": "wiki.txt"}
{"doc_id": 24, "text": "Above Level 1, level differences are related to how responsibility for safe movement is divided/shared between ADAS and driver rather than specific driving features.\nSAE Automation Levels have been criticized for their technological focus. It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better, which may not be the case.[83] SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure[84] and road user behavior.[85][86]\n\nMobileye System\n\nMobileye CEO Amnon Shashua and CTO Shai Shalev-Shwartz proposed an alternative taxonomy for autonomous driving systems, claiming that a more consumer-friendly approach was needed. Its categories reflect the amount of driver engagement that is required.[87][88] Some vehicle makers have informally adopted some of the terminology involved, while not formally committing to it.[89][90][91][92]\n\nEyes-on/hands-on\nThe first level, hands-on/eyes-on, implies that the driver is fully engaged in operating the vehicle, but is supervised by the system, which intervenes according to the features it supports (e.g., adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking). The driver is entirely responsible, with hands on the wheel, and eyes on the road.[88]\n\nEyes-on/hands-off\nEyes-on/hands-off allows the driver to let go of the wheel. The system drives, the driver monitors and remains prepared to resume control as needed.[88]\n\nEyes-off/hands-off\nEyes-off/hands-off means that the driver can stop monitoring the system, leaving the system in full control. Eyes-off requires that no errors be reproducible (not triggered by exotic transitory conditions) or frequent, that speeds are contextually appropriate (e.g., 80 mph on limited-access roads), and that the system handle typical maneuvers (e.g., getting cut off by another vehicle). The automation level could vary according to the road (e.g., eyes-off on freeways, eyes-on on side streets).[88]\n\nNo driver\nThe highest level does not require a human driver in the car: monitoring is done either remotely (telepresence) or not at all.[88]\n\nSafety\nA critical requirement for the higher two levels is that the vehicle be able to conduct a Minimum Risk Maneuver and stop safely out of traffic without driver intervention.[88]\n\nTechnology\nMain article: Vehicular automation\nArchitecture\nThe perception system processes visual and audio data from outside and inside the car to create a local model of the vehicle, the road, traffic, traffic controls and other observable objects, and their relative motion. The control system then takes actions to move the vehicle, considering the local model, road map, and driving regulations.[93][94][95][96]\n\nNavigation\nMain article: Hybrid navigation\nNavigation involves the use of maps to define a path between origin and destination. Hybrid navigation is the use of multiple navigation systems. Some systems use basic maps, relying on perception to deal with anomalies. Such a map understands which roads lead to which others, whether a road is a freeway, a highway, are one-way, etc. Other systems require highly detailed maps, including lane maps, obstacles, traffic controls, etc.\n\nPerception\nACs need to be able to perceive the world around them. Supporting technologies include combinations of cameras, LiDAR, radar, audio, and ultrasound,[98] GPS, and inertial measurement.[99][100][101] Deep neural networks are used to analyse inputs from these sensors to detect and identify objects and their trajectories.[102] Some systems use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms. Another technique is detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), used to handle potential obstacles.[103][104] Other systems use roadside real-time locating system (RTLS) technologies to aid localization. Tesla's \"vision only\" system uses eight cameras, without LIDAR or radar, to create its bird's-eye view of the environment.[105]\n\nPath planning\nPath planning finds a sequence of segments that a vehicle can use to move from origin to destination. Techniques used for path planning include graph-based search and variational-based optimization techniques. Graph-based techniques can make harder decisions such as how to pass another vehicle/obstacle. Variational-based optimization techniques require more stringent restrictions on the vehicle's path to prevent collisions.[106] The large scale path of the vehicle can be determined by using a voronoi diagram, an occupancy grid mapping, or a driving corridor algorithm. The latter allows the vehicle to locate and drive within open space that is bounded by lanes or barriers.[107]", "filename": "wiki.txt"}
{"doc_id": 25, "text": "Maps\nMaps are necessary for navigation. Map sophistication varies from simple graphs that show which roads connect to each other, with details such as one-way vs two-way, to those that are highly detailed, with information about lanes, traffic controls, roadworks, and more.[98] Researchers at the MITComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) developed a system called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive with simple maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a \"sparse topological map\" such as OpenStreetMap (which has only 2D road features), with sensors that observe road conditions.[108] One issue with highly-detailed maps is updating them as the world changes. Vehicles that can operate with less-detailed maps do not require frequent updates or geo-fencing.\n\nSensors\nSensors are necessary for the vehicle to properly respond to the driving environment. Sensor types include cameras, LiDAR, ultrasound, and radar. Control systems typically combine data from multiple sensors.[109] Multiple sensors can provide a more complete view of the surroundings and can be used to cross-check each other to correct errors.[110] For example, radar can image a scene in, e.g., a nighttime snowstorm, that defeats cameras and LiDAR, albeit at reduced precision. After experimenting with radar and ultrasound, Tesla adopted a vision-only approach, asserting that humans drive using only vision, and that cars should be able to do the same, while citing the lower cost of cameras versus other sensor types.[111] By contrast, Waymo makes use of the higher resolution of LiDAR sensors and cites the declining cost of that technology.[112]\n\nDrive by wire\nMain article: Drive by wire\nDrive by wire is the use of electrical or electro-mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions such as steering or speed control that are traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages.\n\nDriver monitoring\nMain article: Driver monitoring system\nDriver monitoring is used to assess the driver's attention and alertness. Techniques in use include eye monitoring, and requiring the driver to maintain torque on the steering wheel.[113] It attempts to understand driver status and identify dangerous driving behaviors.[114]\n\nVehicle communication\nMain article: Vehicular communication systems\nVehicles can potentially benefit from communicating with others to share information about traffic, road obstacles, to receive map and software updates, etc.[115][116][98]\n\nISO/TC 22 specifies in-vehicle transport information and control systems,[117] while ISO/TC 204 specifies information, communication and control systems in surface transport.[118] International standards have been developed for ADAS functions, connectivity, human interaction, in-vehicle systems, management/engineering, dynamic map and positioning, privacy and security.[119]\n\nRather than communicating among vehicles, they can communicate with road-based systems to receive similar information.\n\nSoftware update\nSee also: Over-the-air programming\nSoftware controls the vehicle, and can provide entertainment and other services. Over-the-air updates can deliver bug fixes and additional features over the internet. Software updates are one way to accomplish recalls that in the past required a visit to a service center. In March 2021, the UNECE regulation on software update and software update management systems was published.[120]\n\nSafety model\nA safety model is software that attempts to formalize rules that ensure that ACs operate safely.[121]\n\nIEEE is attempting to forge a standard for safety models as \"IEEE P2846: A Formal Model for Safety Considerations in Automated Vehicle Decision Making\".[122] In 2022, a research group at National Institute of Informatics (NII, Japan) enhanced Mobileye's Reliable Safety System as \"Goal-Aware RSS\" to enable RSS rules to deal with complex scenarios via program logic.[123]\n\nNotification\nThe US has standardized the use of turquoise lights to inform other drivers that a vehicle is driving autonomously. It will be used in the 2026 Mercedes-Benz EQS and S-Class sedans with Drive Pilot, an SAE Level 3 driving system.[citation needed]\n\nAs of 2023, the Turquoise light had not been standardized by the P.R.C or the UN-ECE.[124]\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nArtificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in the development and operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs), enabling them to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and navigate safely without human intervention. AI algorithms empower AVs to interpret sensory data from various onboard sensors, such as cameras, LiDAR, radar, and GPS, to understand their environment and improve its technological ability and overall safety over time.[125]\n\nChallenges", "filename": "wiki.txt"}

In an AC without a driver, traditional means such as hand signals do not work (no driver, no hands).[158]\n\nBehavior prediction\nACs must be able to predict the behavior of possibly moving vehicles, pedestrians, etc in real time in order to proceed safely.[95] The task becomes more challenging the further into the future the prediction extends, requiring rapid revisions to the estimate to cope with unpredicted behavior. One approach is to wholly recompute the position and trajectory of each object many times per second. Another is to cache the results of an earlier prediction for use in the next one to reduce computational complexity.[159][160]\n\nHandover\nThe ADAS has to be able to safely accept control from and return control to the driver.[161]\n\nTrust\nConsumers will avoid ACs unless they trust them as safe.[162][163] Robotaxis operating in San Francisco received pushback over perceived safety risks.[164] Automatic elevators were invented in 1900, but did not become common until operator strikes and trust was built with advertising and features such as an emergency stop button.[165][166]", "filename": "wiki.txt"}
{"doc_id": 27, "text": "Economics\nAutonomous also present various political and economic implications. The transportation sector holds significant sway in many the political and economic landscapes. For instance, many US states generates much annual revenue from transportation fees and taxes.[167] The advent of self-driving cars could profoundly affect the economy by potentially altering state tax revenue streams. Furthermore, the transition to autonomous vehicles might disrupt employment patterns and labor markets, particularly in industries heavily reliant on driving professions.[167] Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that in 2019, the sector employed over two million individuals as tractor-trailer truck drivers.[168] Additionally, taxi and delivery drivers represented approximately 370,400 positions, and bus drivers constituted a workforce of over 680,000.[169][170][171] Collectively, this amounts to a conceivable displacement of nearly 2.9 million jobs, surpassing the job losses experienced in the 2008 Great Recession.[172]\n\nEquity and Inclusion\nThe prominence of certain demographic groups within the tech industry inevitably shapes the trajectory of autonomous vehicle (AV) development, potentially perpetuating existing inequalities.[173]\n\nEthical issues\nSee also: Machine ethics\nPedestrian Detection\nResearch from Georgia Tech revealed that autonomous vehicle detection systems were generally five percent less effective at recognizing darker-skinned individuals. This accuracy gap persisted despite adjustments for environmental variables like lighting and visual obstructions.[174]\n\nRationale for liability\nStandards for liability have yet to be adopted to address crashes and other incidents. Liability could rest with the vehicle occupant, its owner, the vehicle manufacturer, or even the ADAS technology supplier, possibly depending on the circumstances of the crash.[175] Additionally, the infusion of ArtificiaI Intelligence technology in autonomous vehicles adds layers of complexity to ownership and ethical dynamics. Given that AI systems are inherently self-learning, a question arises of whether accountability should rest with the vehicle owner, the manufacturer, or the AI developer?[176]\n\nTrolley problem\nThe trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. Adapted for ACs, it considers an AC carrying one passenger confronts a pedestrian who steps in its way. The ADAS notionally has to choose between killing the pedestrian or swerving into a wall, killing the passenger.[177] Possible frameworks include deontology (formal rules) and utilitarianism (harm reduction).[95][178][179]\n\nOne public opinion survey reported that harm reduction was preferred, except that passengers wanted the vehicle to prefer them, while pedestrians took the opposite view. Utilitarian regulations were unpopular.[180] Additionally, cultural viewpoints exert substantial influence on shaping responses to these ethical quandaries. Another study found that cultural biases impact preferences in prioritizing the rescue of certain individuals over others in car accident scenarios.[176]\n\nPrivacy\nSome ACs require an internet connection to function, opening the possibility that a hacker might gain access to private information such as destinations, routes, camera recordings, media preferences, and/or behavioral patterns, although this is true of an internet-connected device.[181][182][183]\n\nRoad infrastructure\nACs make use of road infrastructure (e.g., traffic signs, turn lanes) and may require modifications to that infrastructure to fully achieve their safety and other goals.[184] In March 2023, the Japanese government unveiled a plan to set up a dedicated highway lane for ACs.[185] In April 2023, JR East announced their challenge to raise their self-driving level of Kesennuma Line bus rapid transit (BRT) in rural area from the current Level 2 to Level 4 at 60 km/h.[186]\n\nTesting\nApproaches\nACs can be tested via digital simulations,[187][188] in a controlled test environment,[189] and/or on public roads. Road testing typically requires some form of permit[190] or a commitment to adhere to acceptable operating principles.[191] For example, New York requires a test driver to be in the vehicle, prepared to override the ADAS as necessary.[192]\n\nA prototype of Waymo's self-driving car, navigating public streets in Mountain View, California in 2017\nIn California, self-driving car manufacturers are required to submit annual reports describing how often their vehicles autonomously disengaged from autonomous mode.[193] This is one measure of system robustness (ideally, the system should never disengage).[194]", "filename": "wiki.txt"}

Large, senior research fellow with the Human Factors Research Group at the University of Nottingham, disguised himself as a car seat in a study to test people's reactions to driverless cars. He said, \"We wanted to explore how pedestrians would interact with a driverless car and developed this unique methodology to explore their reactions.\" The study found that, in the absence of someone in the driving seat, pedestrians trust certain visual prompts more than others when deciding whether to cross the road.[213]\n\nIncidents\nTesla\nSee also: Tesla Autopilot § Notable crashes\nAs of 2023, Tesla's ADAS Autopilot/Full Self Driving (beta) was classified as Level 2 ADAS.[214]\n\nOn 20 January 2016, the first of five known fatal crashes of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred, in China's Hubei province.[215] Initially, Tesla stated that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to determine whether the car had been on Autopilot at the time. However, the car failed to take evasive action.\n\nAnother fatal Autopilot crash occurred in May in Florida in a Tesla Model S[216][217] that crashed into a tractor-trailer. In a civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla documented that the car had been on Autopilot.[218] According to Tesla, \"neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.\" Tesla claimed that this was Tesla's first known Autopilot death in over 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) with Autopilot engaged. Tesla claimed that on average one fatality occurs every 94 million miles (151 million kilometers) across all vehicle types in the US.[219][220][221] However, this number also includes motorcycle/pedestrian fatalities.[222][223] The ultimate NTSB report concluded Tesla was not at fault; the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars, the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.[224]\n\nGoogle Waymo\nSee also: Waymo § Crashes", "filename": "wiki.txt"}

The transport sector has the potential to improve the lives and livelihoods of billions of people. However, as well as meeting people’s needs today, the sector must be ready to respond to future generations’ expectations: this is the essence of sustainable development.\n\nThe European Union Council of Ministers of Transport, has defined a sustainable transportation system as one that “allows the basic access and development needs of individuals, companies and society to be met safely and in a manner consistent with human and ecosystem health, and promotes equity within and between successive generations.” *1\n\nThe United Nations has defined sustainable transport as “the provision of services and infrastructure for the mobility of people and goods— advancing economic and social development to benefit today’s and future generations—in a manner that is safe, affordable, accessible, efficient, and resilient, while minimising carbon and other emissions and environmental impact.”\n\nA range of innovative mobility trends, including shared mobility, and providing affordable and sustainable mobility options for people, can help achieve global sustainability goals.\n\nShared mobility\nShared mobility can play a key role in reducing emissions as well as congestion. By sharing various modes of transport (cars, scooters, e-bikes) we can avoid owned vehicles standing idle for most of the day and optimise the use of vehicles by doing more with less. ‘NOwnership’, in which people do not own the means of transportation but pay per use,- has already started to change our habits, especially in urban areas.\n\nAccording to research conducted by MIT on the benefits of shared mobility, this type of mobility could also reduce the occupation of parking spaces in cities by 86 per cent, freeing up precious public space and radically rethinking how space is used. *2\n\nPublic transport\nImproving the quality and quantity of public transport services is one of the most eﬃcient ways of reducing both emissions and congestion. The real competitor of collective transport is individual transport, so it is crucial to oﬀer services of good quality and high frequency.\n\nCountries or cities that invest the most in public transport systems are also those with the highest shares of modal split. For example, a recent study showed that the availability of rail infrastructure and services has a direct influence on modal split and greenhouse gas emissions. *3\n\nSmart mobility\nDigital technologies enable automated mobility and smart traffic management, making transport more efficient and thus reducing emissions. Intelligent transport systems will play a key role in making mobility more efficient on our roads, on the water and in the air.\n\nFor example, peer-to-peer, vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity can support sustainable trip choices, allow for multimodal transport, improve access to public transport and reduce congestion as well as fuel consumption. Connectivity can optimise travel mode and route selection, improving traffic flow and reducing fuel consumption.\n\nAutomated vehicle control promises to improve energy efficiency, safety, and convenience. With each level of automation and improved connectivity, fuel consumption is reduced.\n\nAccess to mobility\nSustainable mobility also includes the important notion of access to mobility, regardless of income or location. \n\nSustainable mobility includes equity in accessibility, with particular attention to more vulnerable groups of the population and geographical areas at risk of social exclusion.\n\nWalking & cycling\nThe promotion of soft mobility is a simple way to reduce emissions and improve the quality of life, especially in urban areas. \n\nSafety\nRoad accidents are one of the main causes of preventable mortality. A recent World Health Organization (WHO) report 4 indicated that 1.35 million people die each year on our roads, and it is the leading cause of death for children and young adults between 5 and 29 years of age.\n\nTens of millions more are injured or disabled every year. Sustainable mobility must also be safe mobility. By leveraging technology and innovation, the number of transport-related deaths and injuries will be reduced.\n\nReducing emissions from every mode of transport\nIn parallel with increasing efficiency, ‘decarbonizing’ transport is vital. For around 200 years, we have relied on fossil sources to power transport. We need to shift to renewable sources, fast. This means a fundamental shift, and all solutions will be needed.", "filename": "4.txt"}
{"doc_id": 34, "text": "What will the sustainable mobility of the future be like?\n\nThe future will either be sustainable, or there will no future. And for this to happen, sustainable mobility is a key pillar. We tell what the trends are and which of them will be seen the most. \n\nWe can rarely be sure what the future will look like. However, when it comes to mobility, it is very clear. It will be sustainable. This is largely the result of strong investment in technological innovation, the promotion of renewable energies and, most importantly, a change in the mentality of consumers and their concern for the environment.\n\nThat is why 2022 is a key year in which different methodologies and solutions are being incorporated that will make conventional transport more responsible and ecological. Here we will explain what are and what will be the trends in sustainable mobility that we will see. And, this time, we will start by talking about cars because in years to come they will be very different from those we are familiar with today.\n\nThe cars of the future: Electric, connected and autonomous\nElectric vehicles\nMore and more brands are now investing in the development of electric cars. In fact, this is a market does not stop growing and is expected to continue doing so thanks to the strong investment that is being made to promote the installation of charging stations, one of the factors that continues to discourage drivers when opting for an electric car.\n\nThis is really good news when it comes to meeting SDG 11 \"Building sustainable cities and communities\", since 75% of CO2 is emitted in urban environments and largely comes from the emissions generated by vehicles.\n\nThere are currently about 180,000 electric vehicles circulating in Spain and by 2030, five million are expected to do so. This is the first step towards ensuring a zero-emission fleet by 2050. \n\nConnected vehicles\nBy connected car, we mean a vehicle that has any type of telematic device that can connect to the Internet to optimise journeys and reduce consumption. According to a report on \"Sustainable Mobility of the Future and its Impact on the SDGs\", it is estimated that by 2025 more than 500 million vehicles of this type will be circulating worldwide. This may also save about 11,000 lives and save 400,000 tons of CO2 per year. \n\nAutonomous vehicles\nConnected vehicles will not be the only ones playing a leading role. In the coming decades, they will share space with autonomous vehicles, as this is an industry that does not stop growing. Undoubtedly, self-driving will be one of the most revolutionary trends. But, in the end, your ultimate goal will be the same as before: To achieve a more efficient use of infrastructures and improve the safety and comfort of drivers.\n\nDifferent studies estimate that, in just ten years, 40% of road mileage can be driven by autonomous vehicles. But, it is important to remember that there are 5 types of levels to calibrate the autonomy of a vehicle. We are currently at level 2, but there are new projects that aspire to reach level 3.\n\nOther trends in sustainable mobility\nElectrification of last-mile freight transport\nFor years, we have been witnessing unstoppable growth in eCommerce. While 2021 was the year of online shopping, 2022 will be the year of last-mile delivery. If we talk about sustainability, this has a very important environmental impact since making so many deliveries in such a short time means using a large number of vehicles that generate CO2 emissions.\n\nTo solve this problem, electrification is once again the best solution. That is why Low Emission Zones (LEZs) have been created in large cities that restrict access to urban centres for the vehicles that cause the most pollution so this will no longer be a problem.\n\nThe transition to electric, connected vehicles not only has a significant environmental impact, it can also mean better end-results for the fleet. For example, telematics can used to exercise precise control over the performance of each vehicle and enable companies to optimise their routes.\n\nUrban planning for sustainable cities\nThe creation of sustainable cities one of the objectives that need to be promoted. But this is only possible if there is correct urban planning. This is why they are starting to include new bike lanes, as well as exclusive lanes for buses. The latter is helping to encourage the use of public transport, making traffic more agile and efficient. \n\nElectric scooters in cities\nThe use of electric scooters has increased exponentially in recent years. Especially in large European cities such as Amsterdam, Madrid, Barcelona and Dublin, where they can be rented by means of a number of different applications. Just like the electric vehicle, this option enables you to travel through the centre of large cities comfortably and respectfully, as it helps to reduce the emission of polluting gases.", "filename": "5.txt"}
{"doc_id": 35, "text": "Digitalisation and shared mobility applications\nTechnological progress is making it possible to advance significantly towards sustainable mobility. It has enable people to access more efficient processes and services. For example, there are already applications which display the route where there is less traffic or which is the shortest. There are even applications that show the route available to go by public transport, electric scooter or bicycle. All this enables the user, in this case the driver, to choose the most suitable route based on all the available options.\n\nRemote working\nRemote working is undoubtedly one of the most positive measures with regard to sustainable mobility. And fortunately, since 2020 it appears to have come to stay. Even though the main objective is not sustainability, but flexibility and work-life balance, it has a very positive impact on the environment. It means that the number of people who take a car to travel to their place of work is much lower and, therefore, CO2 emissions are reduced. ", "filename": "5.txt"}
{"doc_id": 36, "text": "Urban air mobility is taking off\n\nThe term 'urban air mobility' (UAM) is used to describe new mobility concepts and the largescale expansion of urban mobility into the air. The aim is to create a safe, environmentally friendly and efficient transport system and to relieve congested infrastructure, especially in fast-growing urban areas. Automated flying objects like VTOLs (electric vertical take-off and landing) or air taxis will transport passengers (urban air mobility) and cargo drones or uncrewed aircraft systems (UASs) will transport freight (urban air logistics) at low altitudes. What seemed like a remote possibility a few years ago is now a near reality as mobility shifts into the 'third dimension' and urban airspace becomes the new frontier of development.\n\nA reliable legal framework is crucial for the successful economic development and implementation of the entire UAM market. This needs to include standards for technological certifications and approvals to ensure the safety of the required infrastructure and regulation of the urban (uncrewed) air mobility market.\n\nThe Urban Air Mobility market\nUrban air mobility is (rightly) considered a market with great potential. By 2030, approximately five billion people (around 60% of the world's population) are expected to live in cities and urban regions. Inevitably, this will create immense infrastructure challenges.\n\nAccording to businesswire 2023, the global urban air mobility will grow from around USD 2 billion in 2021 at a CAGR of 30.2% from 2022 to 2031. By 2031, the market is expected to reach around USD 31 billion. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) predicts the EU will become the market leader with a 31% share of the global market. The consulting firm Roland Berger assumes that the number of drones used as air taxis, airport shuttles and as part of inner-city flight services will grow exponentially in the next few years to almost 160,000 autonomous electric drones worldwide by 2050, with an associated annual turnover of almost USD 90 billion. This makes the market attractive to investors. The auditing and consulting firm Deloitte also includes freight and commercial intercity services (advanced air mobility or AAM) in its market forecast and predicts that the US market for AAM could reach a volume of USD 115 billion by 2035.\n\nMarket participants and required infrastructure\nIn addition to traditional global aviation businesses like Airbus and Boeing, a large number of start-ups (some of them very small) is working worldwide on the implementation of UAM concepts. These include Volocopter, Lilium, EHang and Joby Aviation. Small or not, interest from the public and investors is growing: AHK France gave an award to Volocopter in February 2023 for its innovative UAM concept, and electric air taxis are to be used at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, albeit not for commercial purposes but for show flights.\n\nUAM can only realise its full potential if it is integrated into existing urban mobility. This requires suitable infrastructure and corresponding interfaces. The airspace structure must be adapted to the new developments. In particular, suitable ground infrastructure must be designed and take-off and landing zones created. Strategic partners which provide the necessary infrastructure, in this case vertiports, are also crucial for the use of air taxis. UAM isn't just about the transportation vehicles themselves though. A variety of stakeholders will be involved including:\n\nThere are a number of legal hurdles to be overcome if the UAM market is to reach its full potential:\n\nDrones\n\nFollowing the European Commission’s 2015 Aviation Strategy, the EU developed a comprehensive regulatory framework for drones. Since 2018, all drones, regardless of their weight, are subject to harmonised safety rules. To ensure safe drone operations, the Commission also adopted several regulations regarding the air traffic management system for drones. These include Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945, which set out detailed rules and procedures for the operation of uncrewed aircraft and established requirements for the design and manufacture of uncrewed aircraft systems.\n\nThe European Union published a new drone strategy (Drone Strategy 2.0) in November 2022, presenting a plan for a European drone market. By 2030, deliveries of medicine, emergency services and innovative air mobility services (air taxis) with (autonomous) drones should be part of everyday life in Europe. The Strategy contains 19 operational, technical and financial flagship actions. The aim is to create a suitable legal and commercial environment for airspace, a market for drones, and to pave the way for large-scale commercial flight operations.\n\nCertification", "filename": "6.txt"}
{"doc_id": 37, "text": "Regulations for certification and, in particular, the definition of requirements and regulations for type certification are set down by the EASA. In June 2022, EASA was the first agency worldwide to publish draft rules for the operation of air taxis in cities. The draft covers airworthiness, flight operations, flight crew licensing and air traffic regulations. The proposals clarify the basic certification path that may apply to developers in Europe for VTOLs in the future. This is a first mover advantage with real effects as is demonstrated by the fact that the UK has already adopted the regulations proposed by EASA and is currently consulting on a further framework (as we discuss here).\n\nIn April 2024 the European Commission adopted a set of measures, based on the EASA regulatory proposals published in Opinion No 03/2023 in August 2023, paving the way for the launch of air taxi services and other innovative drone uses. The situation is different, however, for autonomous, ie pilotless personal air vehicles (PAV) in relation to which the development of certification regulations is still pending.\n\nStandardisation of infrastructure and 'U-space'\n\nWith regard to the standardisation of infrastructure requirements (whether for vertiports or air traffic control), the Commission adopted the 'U-space package' in mid-2021. U-space ('U' stands for uncrewed services) is a European system developed for the management of drone traffic. The package includes three Regulations that together are intended to create the conditions for both drones and crewed aircraft to operate safely in the part of the airspace designated as U-space. The new rules are primarily intended to facilitate more complex and longer missions, particularly in low and densely populated airspace and beyond the visual range of the remote pilot. The EU rules came into force on 26 January 2023. Member States can now designate a specified airspace as U-space in which mandatory services must be provided. A German U-Space law has been overdue ever since. The overall objective is to create a competitive market with fair access for UAS operators.\n\nVertiports\n\nThe EASA published specifications for the construction of vertiports in March 2022. The next step is to develop a complete legal framework for the construction and certification of vertiports as well as for the operation and supervision of operators.\n\nFramework conditions in Germany\nWith the aim of creating reliable regulatory conditions, the Federal Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (BMVI) adopted a Memorandum of Understanding with the Urban Air Mobility model cities of Aachen, Hamburg, Ingolstadt and Northern Hesse in June 2021 to implement and further develop innovative drone technology. The innovation network is intended to provide infrastructure and regulatory solutions through best-practice examples and to test consumer attitudes.\n\nThe EU’s UAM initiative provided funding of EUR 29m for new ideas and project outlines to support research and testing related to UAM. Since 2021, the BMVI has continued this funding and provided around EUR 15m for the Innovative Air Mobility initiative up to 2023. The Federal Ministry of Digital Affairs and Transport has also established a digital platform for uncrewed aviation. The Digital Platform for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (dipul) provides all safety-relevant and legal information on the use of drones in Germany.\n\nOutlook\nIt remains to be seen how regulation of the UAM market will develop. Europe has legal, technical and infrastructure opportunities which can help it succeed in the field of UAM, but it lags considerably behind especially Asia and the Middle East. This gap will need to close if the EU wants to accelerate technical and economic development. Market players should keep a close watch on the prevailing and developing legal framework governing UAM to make the most of business opportunities in the face of changing requirements.", "filename": "6.txt"}

Although multiple factors may facilitate the adoption of UAM, its implementation may be difficult owing to the lack of customer acceptance and usage intentions. This study proposes a research model to explore the effects of trust and customer perceived value on the acceptance of UAM as public transportation. In this study, empirical data from 573 respondents were collected via an online survey. Additionally, thirteen hypotheses on trust and customer-perceived value were presented, and a relationship model was conceptualized and analyzed using structural equation modeling based on the partial least squares method. The results indicated that all thirteen hypotheses proposed in this study were statistically supported and trust in technology and customer perceived value was found to positively influence the intention to use UAM as public transport. Notably, functional, emotional, and social values were found to considerably affect trust in technology and customer-perceived value; specifically, functional value had the greatest impact in this context. The results of this study validate the importance of trust and customer-perceived value, which should be prioritized in the adoption of UAM as a public transportation service.\n\nIntroduction\nUrban air mobility (UAM) is a safe and efficient alternative mode of airborne transport using highly automated aircraft. Recently, UAM has received considerable attention from the transportation sector and academia. UAM is defined as “an air transportation system for passengers and cargo in and around urban environments” (European Union Aviation Safety Agency, 2021, Andritsos et al., 2022). In metropolitan areas, UAM can provide on-piloted, remotely piloted or operated, and automated on-demand transport services for passengers and freight (Lascara et al., 2018). Moreover, UAM facilitates short-range and point-to-point intra- and inter-urban transportation (Lim et al., 2022). Furthermore, UAM can be used for various operations, such as deliveries conducted by drones (Dayarian et al., 2020), postal services (Soffronoff et al., 2016), infrastructural inspections (Besada et al., 2018), traffic monitoring (Sutheerakul et al., 2017), and agriculture (Puri et al., 2017).\n\nThis revolutionary concept of UAM relies heavily on cutting-edge technologies that impart vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities (Cohen et al., 2021, Andritsos et al., 2022), which mitigate resource wastage and allow UAM modes to operate in urban environments (Rice et al., 2022). Leveraging VTOL technologies can substantially reduce door-to-door travel times and address surface-congestion issues during inter- and intra-city commutes (Shaheen et al., 2018). VTOL aircraft, designed for agile vertical ascent and descent, are critical for seamlessly integrating air transportation within densely populated urban landscapes (Song & Yeo, 2021). The integration of UAM and public transport can provide passengers with cost-effective and comfortable transportation, as well as interconnected ground–air transport. UAM can serve as an on-demand service, offering a unique and time-saving experience for users willing to pay for speed and convenience (Wu & Zhang, 2021). Furthermore, UAM can rapidly deliver packages and transport people in urban areas via air metro and taxi for sightseeing activities (Rice et al., 2022).", "filename": "10.txt"}
{"doc_id": 42, "text": "Market-focused studies have revealed that the UAM market is expected to expand tremendously. Private UAM operations and commercial air mobility services are expected to commence between 2022 and 2025 and in 2025, respectively (Grandl et al., 2018). The value of the UAM passenger market related to intra- and intercity travel will be $32 billion in 2035, with 23,000 operating aircraft. The global value of this market is expected to be $74 billion. A UAM market study conducted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration revealed that soon, air taxi and airport shuttle services in the U.S. could experience a daily demand of 82,000 passengers (Reiche et al., 2018). In the early stages of UAM deployment across 486 urban areas in the U.S., the combined demand for airport shuttles and air taxis is estimated at 55,000 daily trips and 82,000 daily passengers. This demand will result in an annual market value of $2.5 billion and may be fulfilled by approximately 4,000 four- to five-seat aircraft. In an unconstrained scenario, the potential demand could reach 11 million daily trips, with a resulting market valuation of $500 billion (Goyal et al., 2021). Customer's acceptance and their willingness to pay for a technology are essential to the success of innovative products (Schmidt et al., 2016). Such products generally gain consumers' acceptance when their benefits become evident (Raj et al., 2020). Improving customers' acceptance is, therefore, a prerequisite for the successful launch of UAM as the next-generation mode of transportation (Yedavalli & Mooberry, 2019).\n\nHowever, several obstacles, such as regulations (Nehk et al., 2021); infrastructure (Takacs & Haidegger, 2022); weather (Reiche et al., 2021); cost (Ahmed et al., 2021); lack of societal acceptance (Cetin et al., 2022); and user concerns regarding safety, privacy, and environmental impacts (European Union Aviation Safety Agency, 2021), must be overcome before UAM is accepted as a mode of transportation. The global automotive consumer survey conducted by Deloitte revealed that consumers' concerns regarding the use of UAM are primarily safety-related; 48 % of the survey respondents were concerned regarding the safety of air taxis (Deloitte, 2020). In addition to the willingness to fly, safety concerns regarding varying weather conditions affect customers’ intent to use UAM. Shaheen et al. (2018) explored the impact of weather conditions on the willingness of respondents to fly via UAM under adverse weather conditions. The results revealed that respondents displayed increased levels of fear and anxiety regarding UAM use under such conditions. Additionally, the respondents were concerned regarding snow, low visibility owing to fog, and turbulence.\n\nResearchers have investigated the factors influencing consumers' acceptance of UAM. Kim et al. (2022) explored the influence of trust and service quality on user adoption of UAM. Trust in technology positively influenced the intention to use UAM. Service-quality factors related to transport substantiate the perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of UAM. Rice et al. (2022) evaluated consumers' perceptions of the desired features and factors expected from air taxis. Passengers were primarily concerned with the security and safety of using UAM as a transportation service. Al Haddad et al. (2020) identified and quantified the factors affecting the adoption and utilization of UAM; safety, trust, affinity for automation, data concerns, social attitudes, and sociodemographics were identified as important factors. The following factors affecting UAM usage were identified: time savings, perceived automation costs, and service reliability. Winter et al. (2020) quantitatively assessed the factors that reliably predict consumers’ willingness to fly via UAM. They reported that familiarity, value, enjoyment, wariness related to new technology, fear, and happiness were the major factors identified. Notably, the findings indicate six critical factors that affect consumers' choice to adopt this mode of transportation.", "filename": "10.txt"}
{"doc_id": 43, "text": "Trust in technology is the conviction that a technology can behave as expected in a specific situation with a potentially negative outcome (Mcknight et al., 2011). Kim et al. (2022) revealed that trust is a major factor influencing acceptance, which is an essential predictor of willingness to adopt technology and affects customers' acceptance of UAM. Customer perceived value could shape customers' perceptions of the service and positively affect their behavioral intentions (Putrianti & Semuel, 2018). Customers determine this perceived value by comparing the benefits or utilities obtained from a product or service (Zeithaml, 1988). Therefore, customer perceived value affects their future intention to use UAM for transportation.\n\nThis study investigated customers' perceptions of the utility of UAM as a form of public transport and the associated trust in technology. User acceptance models were investigated and expanded to explain the factors affecting the behavioral intention to use UAM for public transportation.

La Masa 1, 20156, Milano Italy \n\nIn the last years, Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has been receiving increasing attention and even if the first services are expected to be launched shortly, there is still uncertainty about which type of commercial services (e.g., airport shuttles or city-taxis) will be implemented at an early stage, as well as which price point will be perceived as affordable by travelers. Based on data collected through a large-scale survey campaign in the Milan metropolitan area (Italy), in this paper passengers' value of travel time savings for different UAM services are estimated using advanced discrete choice modeling. Estimated mixed logit models allowed to comparatively analyze the differences between the two potential use cases, i.e., airport shuttle and city-taxi services. Results show a willingness to pay for UAM services from/to airports that is greater (in a range of 44%–57%) than for travelling within the metropolitan area, and greater (in a range of 31%–44%) for business travels than for other purposes, indicating that the most financially sustainable UAM services will potentially be available for airport-shuttle connections from/to central business districts. \n\nE-mail addresses: pierluigi.coppola@polimi.it (P.

This trend is expected to continue, with the world's urban population projected to reach 6.7 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2019). A growing urbanization rate has been usually considered as beneficial for the economic growth (Youn et al., 2016; Glaeser et al., 1992), however this also poses enormous challenges to cities, to their services and particularly to the mobility system. Increases in traffic congestion, travel times and air pollution are among the expected negative externalities envisaged for a system which, as it stands today, would not be able to cope with such an expected increase in mobility demand. This claims for the need of exploring new mobility solutions and paradigms to face these forthcoming challenges. \n\nFor this reason, this study investigates passengers' value of (or users' willingness to pay for) travel time savings for UAM services, comparatively exploring the differences between two potential use cases, i.e., \nairport shuttles and city-taxis. The topic of how much travelers value UAM services is still underrepresented in the literature. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to comparatively cover this aspect in relation to these two potential use cases. Data from a large-scale revealed and stated preference survey from the Milan metropolitan area (Italy) have been collected in the period 2021–2022 and have been subsequently analyzed by means of discrete choice models. The goal is to provide policy indications to both public and private transport planners interested in deploying and developing a sustainable UAM ecosystem. \n\nIt is important to point out that the results presented in this paper has been achieved through a survey carried out in the Milan metropolitan area and under some specific assumptions valid for the specific case study (e.g. number of airports, their distance from the city center, level of service on the competing modes, specifically car congestion and level of service of local public transport, …), that might not be directly transferable to other contexts. However, it is noted that the metropolitan area of Milan presents socio-economic characteristics and transport criticalities that are typical of the main European urbanized areas and Western cities, such as a highly densified city center and an extended periphery, a network of urban highways and regional rail services that, despite congestion in the peak periods, allow the presence of activities and services for a number of daily city-users, and so on. Therefore, even with some caveats, the results of the present study could be generalized at least for those metropolitan contexts that are characterized by similar multimodal transport systems and urban fabrics.

{"doc_id": 45, "text": "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. A review of the UAM literature, focusing on potential use cases, announced pilots and demand studies clustered by service type, is presented in Section 2. A description of both data and methods used is given in Section 3, while results from the analysis are reported in Section 4. Discussion is contained in Section 5, while concluding remarks together with future research directions are finally reported in Section 6. \n\nThe literature on UAM accelerated in the last years, together with industry announcements about the starting of eVTOL flying certification processes which have made UAM introduction seem ever closer. In fact, technology is the driving force behind this new mobility concept, and an advanced propulsion technology has been identified among the pillars to get reliable VTOL vehicles (Pons-Prats et al., 2022; Courtin et al., 2018). \n\nElectrification is generally seen as one of the most promising trends for motorized mobility in urban areas (see (Dia et al., 2019; Miskolczi et al., \n2021; Coppola et al., 2023)) and the same happens for UAM. Industrial research and development has mostly focused on battery-powered eVTOLs rather than on their hybrid-powered or hydrogen fuel cell counterparts for short range urban services. Therefore, leveraging on the one side on electrification and its environmental benefits (see (Afonso et al., 2021; Cho and Kim, 2022; Mudumba et al., 2021; Rothfeld et al., \n2021)), on the other on the potential urban ground congestion reduction, worldwide companies and operators entered or interested in entering the UAM market announced UAM service launches, with the perspective of starting first operations between 2024 and 2026 (see Table 1). \n\nExamining these announcements, two primary UAM service clusters promising to reshape the future of transport can be distinguished: air taxi and airport shuttle services. The first will be point-to-point (i.e., vertiport-to-vertiport) aerial services operating in metropolitan urban areas or connecting different cities, as for the Southern Spain case (Lilium, 2022) where they are expected to meet the high demand for premium tourism. Airport shuttle services instead will connect the city centers, or their near proximities, to the airports, providing travelers access and egress air connections allowing to avoid uncertainties of traffic congestion, delays, and other transport issues traditionally affecting ground-based routes. Examples of announcements for UAM \nairport shuttles pertain, for instance, to Rome (Volocopter, 2021b) and Milan (SEA, 2022) in Italy, as well as to Osaka (Aviation, 2022) in Japan: UAM operations are expected to commence concurrently with the Religious Jubilee in 2025, the \"Milano-Cortina\" Olympic Winter Games in 2026 and the World Expo 2025, respectively. \n\nThe same two clusters can be found analyzing the worldwide scientific literature on UAM demand (Long et al., 2023): on the one hand, studies that focus on air taxi services, on the other, those focusing on UAM airport shuttles (see Table 2). \n\nMost of these studies explore the UAM demand by examining disaggregated data from surveys (as in (Cho and Kim, 2022; Ilahi et al., \n2021; Ahmed et al., 2021; Boddupalli, 2019; Fu et al., 2019; Brunelli et al., 2023b; Al Haddad et al., 2020)). Some of them provide insights \n\nThis study aims to contribute to the existing literature by investigating travelers' value of travel time savings for UAM services, comparatively exploring the differences between airport shuttles and city-taxis, and providing policy indications based on how much future potential users tend to value these new aerial mobility services. \n\nAs for detailed description in the following subparagraphs, the methodological approach consists of three main phases: \n\nThe interviewees were presented with up to six choice situations based on the information provided in the RP section of the questionnaire, considering their typical trip duration, the number of people they usually travel with, and the availability of a car for their journey. This approach aimed to align the choice situations with the respondents' actual experiences, reducing hypothetical bias in their responses \n(Hensher, 2010).

Regarding UAM, the in-vehicle times and costs were tailored around estimated values obtained by assuming eVTOL technical specifications (such as a cruise speed of 150 km/h) and unit service fares \n(at 3.5 €/km, in line with values reported in (Rimjha et al., 2021a)). \n\nThese assumptions considered feedback from industry experts and UAM \nservice operators planning to enter the Italian market. Waiting/boarding times for UAM and access/egress times were instead assumed following input from companies specializing in vertiport and UAM network design. Table 3 shows the summary of the modal alternatives, together with level of service attributes and their levels of variation in each design. It is important to note that, to streamline interview duration, designs were separated by blocks, each comprising six choice situations. \n\nOnly one block per respondent has been proposed. In this way the efficient designs have been split into smaller sets, guaranteeing balanced attribute levels within each block. This approach ensured that respondents did not encounter only low or high attribute levels for any given attribute, ensuring that the choice situations were evenly spread across the respondents. \n\nThe survey, available both in Italian and English, was designed to be administered as Computer Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI). Interviewees were on-site randomly approached at the major transport nodes or point of interest of the Milan metropolitan area, including airports (Milano Malpensa and Milano Linate), railway stations (Milano Cadorna, Milano Centrale, Milano Rogoredo, Monza), bus stations with interchange parking areas (Lampugnano, Famagosta) and other important attraction poles of the Municipality of Milan (such as City Life or Gae Aulenti square). The questionnaire ensured complete anonymity and was fully compliant with the European General Data Protection Regulation. It was submitted only to people of legal age, as defined by the Italian legislation, without any kind of discrimination.

Unlike traditional multinomial logit models (MNL), ML allows for a more appropriate representation of reality, where systematic and random components for each alternative included in users' choice sets differ among respondents. This allows to relax the assumption of constant marginal utilities across all individuals, identifying heterogeneity in travelers' tastes. Moreover, the ML formulation does not require the axiom of independence from \n\nThe following subparagraphs illustrate the sample composition and the estimated models, focusing on the simulated (in-vehicle) modal value of travel time savings. \n\nSocio-economic and trip characteristic breakdowns of the sample are reported in Table 4. The comparison with the Italian population shows some differences. For instance, middle age groups (i.e., from 35 to 54 years old) are overrepresented with respect to age population distribution percentages, at the expense of people lower than 25 or higher than 64 years old. The same goes for employed people that are overrepresented at the expense of students or unemployed. However, these differences with respect to the Italian population must be intended as a direct result of the on-site random sampling approach for selecting interviewees: these reflect the actual characteristics of people frequenting places where the data collection campaign took place, i.e. mainly individuals of the working age population. \n\nUsing only respondents' socio-economic profile and SP data, two different mode choice models have been estimated. The first model is for trips to access or egress the airports, where the UAM modal alternative is intended as a proxy for an aerial airport shuttle service. The second model is for trips within the metropolitan area, where UAM is intended as a proxy for air taxi services. In both estimated models, the systematic utility function is based on the following mode-specific level of service variables: \n- IVTT, in-vehicle travel time (min); - AET, total access and egress time (min); - WBT, total waiting and boarding time (min); - MC, total monetary cost per person (EUR, €).

To demonstrate that ML specifications \n\nInvestigating travelers' behavior through ML and random parameters offers a more accurate reflection of its inner stochasticity, however, this approach introduces complexities in estimating the value of time savings (i.e., the ratio between time and monetary cost coefficients). In fact, when it is statistically proved that the beta cost coefficient differs across the population, as in this study, using the ratio of the time and cost average beta coefficients as estimator for the value of time leads to a loss of information, as it overlooks differences in individuals' tastes. \n\nTherefore, the approach suggested by (Hess et al., 2005) has been used. Using the ML estimated parameters, the population of time and cost coefficient ratios has been simulated, using inferential statistics to deduce underlying distribution properties. A Monte Carlo simulation with a size of 10′000 has been conducted for each identified demand segment. Therefore, 16 Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out, combining ML estimated in-vehicle time and monetary cost parameters for 4 modal alternatives (i.e., car, public transport, taxi, and UAM), 2 spatial trip patterns (i.e., from/to airports and metropolitan trips) and 2 trip purposes (i.e., business, and non-business trips). For each generated distribution, the median has been considered as central tendency measure, providing a more robust estimate in the presence of outliers or extreme values distant from the mean. Cumulative distributions summarizing simulation outputs for the in-vehicle value of travel time \n(VoTT) savings are depicted in Figs. 2 and 3 for non-business and business trips, respectively. Moreover, statistics related to the simulated distributions have been reported in Table 7. \n\nResults from the modeling estimation reported in Table 6 have shown some behavioral differences among travelers based on the spatial pattern of their trips, i.e., from/to airports and metropolitan journeys. Focusing on ASCs, it is worth noting that passengers prefer choosing UAM services over cars and public transport, holding other variables constant. However, for trips accessing or egressing airports, passengers exhibit an inclination towards traditional taxis service. This might be attributed to the travelers' familiarity with this mode of transport to arrive or depart from airports, also due to its wide accessibility/capillarity in airport settings. Taxis are in fact available almost everywhere in the Milan metropolitan area and pick-up or drop-off can be customized and arranged also at each single origin or destination (e.g., home, office, \n…). \n\nInformation regarding the relative importance attributed by \n\nTable 7 \n\nStatistics of the simulated value of travel time (VoTT) savings distributions. \n\nTrip Purpose Spatial Trip Pattern Mode 1st Quartile Median Mean 3rd Quartile Non-business From/to airports Car 9 21 42 46 Public transport 3 6 8 10 Taxi 24 44 71 85 UAM 26 48 72 87 Metropolitan Car 2 4 8 9 Public transport 4 9 15 17 Taxi 11 26 53 58 UAM 23 34 39 48 Business From/to airports Car 14 32 63 70 Public transport 5 8 11 14 Taxi 34 64 101 123 UAM 38 69 105 126 Metropolitan Car 3 6 13 14 Public transport 5 10 17 20 Taxi 17 39 81 88 UAM 30 44 51 64 ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0967070X24000696-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 48, "text": "UAM services is greater for flights in the metropolitan area rather than for those from/to airports. This can be explained by a combination of factors, including the impact of flying at low altitudes over a densely urbanized environment, such as the metropolitan one, which may negatively affect the safety perception (as reported in (Yedavalli and Mooberry, n.d.)) and consequently the pleasure of the time spent flying with eVTOL aircrafts. Similarly, it has been found that travelers are more sensitive to MC for metropolitan journeys across all transport options, except for public transport and taxis. This can be attributed, on the one hand, to the in-force PT subscription policies in the Milan metropolitan area, which might reduce the perceived cost of using public transport for regular commuters. On the other hand, low fares for taxis over short distances characterizing the metropolitan environment may reduce the perception of travel costs associated with taxi use. As expected, business travelers turned out to be less sensitive to costs compared to non-business ones (as in (Pels et al., 2003; Gupta et al., 2008)) across all modal alternatives. \n\nAs highlighted by (Ilahi et al., 2021; Rimjha et al., 2021a; Al Haddad et al., 2020), income plays a significant role in shaping traveler preferences for UAM. Estimated models identify that travelers with a gross annual income exceeding 120 K€ are more inclined to choose UAM over other transport modes. Moreover, the influence of other socio-economic variables on mode choices has been proved. In fact, modelling results revealed that travelers aged more than 45 years exhibit a higher inclination towards choosing UAM over public transport for trips accessing and egressing airports. This aged-related preference could be attributed to several factors. For instance, older travelers, who may value convenience and time-saving options more than cost considerations, find UAM \nattractive due to its potential to reduce travel times, bypassing ground congestion and avoiding delays and idle times. However, a contrasting trend emerges for metropolitan trips, where older travelers show a lower inclination towards UAM (in line with findings by (Ilahi et al., 2021)). \n\nThis is probably due to the availability of other efficient and competing modal alternatives, such as public transport as for the Milan case. Finally, gender differences emerge as another influential factor in UAM preferences. Particularly, females show less inclination towards choosing UAM for metropolitan trips compared to males (as found by (Al Haddad et al., 2020)). The reasons for this gender discrepancy might be multi-faceted (see (Nasrin and Bunker, 2021) for a review) and it is worth investigating them, for example, in societal norms or safety perceptions related to aerial vehicles. \n\nThe analysis of in-vehicle VoTT savings for non-business trips has shown the following results at the sample median for the different transport modes: \n\nMoving to the comparison between willingness to pay for UAM and ground taxi IVTT savings, a different behavior for trips from/to airports and for those within the metropolitan area has been found. Particularly, for trips to access or egress airports, the VoTT savings resulted to be slightly different (44 €/h for ground taxis and 48 €/h for UAM services), \nsuggesting how they are perceived as similar competing options. However, the situation changes for metropolitan trips, where the willingness to pay for UAM time savings is about 30% higher than that of ground taxis (34 €/h vs 26 €/h, respectively). This indicates how users perceive aerial services differently from ground ones, and how they are willing to pay a premium for UAM services that avoid the risk of being potentially delayed by congested metropolitan ground networks. Furthermore, when examining VoTT savings for UAM airport shuttles versus metropolitan air taxis, the value for airport shuttles time savings (48 €/h) is found to be approximately 40% higher than that of metropolitan air taxis (34 €/h), underlining the relevance of the spatial pattern of the journey, together with the activities for which it is performed, in relation to its value.

{"doc_id": 49, "text": "Focusing on the in-vehicle VoTT savings for business trips, the analysis has shown the following results at sample median for the different transport modes: \n- car travels, 6 €/h for metropolitan trips and 32 €/h for trips from/to airports, representing a 56% and a 52% increase respectively compared to the non-business counterparts; \n- public transport, 10 €/h for metropolitan trips and 8 €/h for trips from/to airports, with a 15% and 37% increase respectively compared to non-business travels; \n- ground taxi services, 39 €/h for metropolitan trips and 64 €/h for trips from/to airports, indicating 48% and 44% increase respectively compared to non-business travels; \n- UAM services, 44 €/h for metropolitan trips and 69 €/h for trips from/to airports, with a 31% and 44% increase respectively compared to non-business travels (these percentage differences between business and non-business travels are higher than that estimated by (Birolini et al., 2019), dealing with access and egress airport modal alternatives and focusing on the Lombardy Region, but lower to those estimated by (Gupta et al., 2008) or (Tam et al., 2011), \nin relation to US or Chinese case studies respectively). \n\nLooking at the overall in-vehicle VoTT savings results, it is worth outlining that users tend to value UAM airport shuttle services more than metropolitan air taxi ones. The percentage difference in VoTT savings between these two UAM potential use cases is in a range between 57% and 44%, depending on the demand segment considered, i.e., business, or non-business travelers. \n\nConsidering the relationship between the value of travel time savings \n(i.e., willingness to pay) and ticket fares, along with the anticipated high costs of first UAM services, introducing aerial airport shuttles could potentially yield better financial performances compared to air citytaxis. As a result, aerial airport shuttle services might be the preferred choice for the initial UAM launch and potential UAM operators could be focused on studying current transport services to/from airports to identify those market segments for whom UAM services can be more attractive. Given the highlighted differences in VoTT savings, UAM fare policies could contemplate segmenting tickets based on business and non-business users, while providing differentiated mobility services (or ancillary ones, still enhancing the overall travel experience) tailored to each traveler category. By tailoring UAM services starting from these insights, a more efficient and financially sustainable urban aerial system can be developed, offering a valuable alternative to conventional transport options. \n\nFurthermore, focusing on aerial airport shuttles and considering the competition with other modes of transport, results showed that UAM VoTT savings are 8% higher than ground taxi ones. This relatively small difference indicates that UAM could represent a competitive alternative to taxis for airport-related travels. This analysis can lead to two policy indications for two different stakeholders of the UAM ecosystem. On the one hand, companies interested in building and managing the UAM \ninfrastructures should analyze the origin-destination relations currently served by taxis connecting the city centers to the airports (and vice versa). This would allow to determine the initial optimal locations for vertiports within the metropolitan area. On the other hand, potential UAM operators should carefully plan their pricing policies, addressing as much as possible fare discrepancies between aerial and ground taxi services: ensuring increasingly competitive and affordable fares could lead to a significant modal shift from taxis to UAM services, encouraging the adoption of a new aerial dimension for passenger mobility. \n\nThis study aimed to contribute to the existing literature by investigating the value of travel time savings (or willingness to pay) for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) services. The research specifically explored the differences between two potential UAM use cases: airport shuttle and city-taxi services. Data from a large-scale revealed (RP) and stated preference (SP) survey from the Milan metropolitan area (Italy) have been collected in the period 2021–2022 and have been subsequently analyzed by means of mixed logit discrete choice models. \n\nResults highlight that the in-vehicle value of travel time (VoTT) \nsavings for UAM airport shuttle services falls in the range of 48–69 €/h, with higher values related to those travelling for business purposes.

{"doc_id": 50, "text": "Likewise, the estimated VoTT savings for UAM city-taxi services fall within the range of 34–44 €/h. Depending on the trip purpose, the VoTT \nsavings for UAM airport shuttle services were found to be approximately 44–57% higher than those for city-taxi ones. These findings suggest that the implementation of UAM airport shuttle services could be the most financially sustainable UAM services, especially in the initial phase when new aerial mobility services are expected to have high fares, gradually decreasing over time. Furthermore, when focusing on airport shuttle services and examining the competition between transport modes, users' willingness to pay for UAM services (48–69 €/h) was found to be 8% higher than that for traditional ground taxis (44–64 €/h). \n\nThis indicates that differences between the pricing policies of the two modes of transport should be minimized to generate a significant modal shift from ground taxis to new aerial services connecting city centers, or central business districts to intercept those travelling for business purpose, with airports. \n\nAmong the limitations of this research, it is important to note that the outcomes of this study rely on specific assumptions and survey data, that might not be directly transferable to other contexts. As stated in the introductory section of this paper, our results could be transferred only to contexts that are characterized by similar multimodal transport systems and urban fabrics. Nevertheless, the methodology proposed can be adapted for the VoTT savings investigation in relation to other case studies. \n\nFuture studies could deepen the analysis by researching the impact of individuals' latent traits, such as personal attitudes (e.g., aversion to fly, vocation for technology) and perceptions (e.g., expectations and safety concerns), on VoTT savings for UAM services. Additionally, a joint RPSP modeling estimation could be conducted, combining information from current RP users' behavior and hypothetical future ones (SP data), \nthereby reducing potential biases related to the choice situations in the SP experiment. This would provide further insights into the factors influencing users' preferences and decision-making when considering UAM services. \n\nPierluigi Coppola: Conceptualization, Validation, Writing - review \n& editing. **Francesco De Fabiis:** Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing - original draft. \n\nFulvio Silvestri: Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing - original draft. \n\nThe data that has been used is confidential. \n\nAdp, A.G., 2021.

{"doc_id": 53, "text": "Mobility business models toward a digital tomorrow: Challenges \n\nHugo P´erez-Moure a, Jesús F. Lampon´ b,*, Pablo Cabanelas a \n\nThe development of digital business models is impacting the traditional value chain for mobility, implying changes as well as future challenges for automotive manufacturers. Taking a Global Value Chain approach, this work analyses the recent evolution, short-term direction, and medium- to long-term future vision of the adoption of digital mobility business models by automotive manufacturers. Results suggest that, while the firms analysed are currently incorporating relevant business models through autonomous vehicles, digital platforms, connectivity, and carsharing, they are mostly focused on marketplace exploitation through digital platforms and services related to connectivity. Key elements for the development of future mobility business models include data collection and management as well as interconnection. At the same time, digitalization is expected to reconfigure not only associated business models but also the relationships among actors within the value chain. These relationships will become more complex for automotive manufacturers, who may lose control of value-added activities and acquire dependence on certain actors such as technology and service partners, which are expected to play a pivotal role in meeting new opportunities. As a result, the decision-making power of value chain participants will likely be more widely distributed. \n\nMobility resulting from the emergence of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as well as shared vehicles is transforming the value chain of the automotive industry, where all relevant actors are seeking to propose and adapt new business models (Cohen and Kouvelis, 2021). Due to its degree of novelty, this growing Mobility sector presents many challenges across diverse areas in which automotive actors hope to participate, including through digital platforms (Loonam and O'Regan, 2022) and in terms of connectivity \n(Bezai et al., 2021). Consequently, mobility has become a dynamic concept with a strong evolutionary component in associated business models (Turienzo, Cabanelas and Lampon, ´ 2023). \n\nIncreasing digitalization has meanwhile fostered a phenomenon known as digital entrepreneurship (Kraus et al., 2019; Ruiz de la Torre and Sanchez, ´ 2022) that entails new value propositions and the need to identify new market segments - and thus the transformation of business models (Michelini and Fiorentino, 2012). New information and communication technologies enable companies to exchange data, reformulate their range of offer to customers, and restructure the value chain based on real needs (Berman, 2012). \n\nThis context has also given rise to new types of economy, such as servitization (Ruiz de la Torre and Sanchez, ´ 2022) and the \n* Corresponding author. \n\nE-mail addresses: hugo.perez.moure@uvigo.es (H. P´erez-Moure), jesus.lampon@uvigo.es (J.F. Lampon), ´ pcabanelas@uvigo.es (P. Cabanelas). \n\nHowever, digitalization does not impact all industries, value chains, and business models in the same way (Turienzo et al., 2023). \n\nThe present research undertakes an analysis of services related to digitalization in the Mobility value chain and their implications for the adoption of business models and value propositions for Mobility as a Service (MaaS) (Jittrapirom et al., 2020; Arias-Molinares and García-Palomares, 2020; Becker et al., 2020). Mobility is already a key sector for many countries; consequently, changes to associated business models are occurring at an accelerated pace (Fournier, 2017; Athanasopoulou et al., 2019; Shammut et al., 2023) and must be better understood. Furthermore, the Mobility sector is currently among the most attractive for both investors and public actors, ranking fourth in R&D investment globally and first in Europe (ACEA, 2022). This points to the importance being given to the development of new technologies and solutions, as well as the confidence that agents are placing in Mobility's potential for growth and transformation (Turienzo, Cabanelas and Lampon, ´ 2023).

{"doc_id": 54, "text": "Despite the importance of MaaS and the rapid evolution and adoption of technologies, the volatility of strategies implemented thus far has fostered uncertainty (Jittrapirom et al., 2020). Furthermore, implementation of these technologies does not generate immediate benefits and carries a high investment risk, leading to some hesitancy in their adoption (Llopis-Albert, Rubio and Valero, 2021). It is therefore crucial to assess the current state of relationships between manufacturers and digital companies, to comprehend the current MaaS strategy, and to project a road-map and future vision, which are currently lacking (Hensher, Mulley and Nelson, 2021). \n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, recent analyses of mobility business models are mainly focused on internal resources and the capabilities of firms to adapt related value propositions in a dynamic technological environment (Teece, 2019; Lanzolla and Markides, 2021; Cabanelas et al., 2023; Turienzo, Cabanelas and Lampon, ´ 2023). These studies are supported by Contingency theory, analyzing the main factors that change and condition the needs of firms as relate to business models (Lanzolla and Markides, 2021; Turienzo, Cabanelas and Lampon, ´ 2023), and by Dynamic Capabilities theory, analyzing the resources (e.g., assets, technologies) and capabilities \n(e.g., identification of opportunities, customer adaptability) with which a firm can generate value for customers (Teece, 2019; Cabanelas et al., 2023). No prior work has incorporated the Global Value Chain (GVC) approach (Gereffi, Humphrey and Sturgeon, 2005; Sturgeon, Van Biesebroeck and Gereffi, 2008) into its theoretical framework for analysis of the evolution of business models related to Mobility. This approach permits the integration of other variables and actors into analysis (beyond the firms' internal resources and capabilities) and offers a broader perspective of precisely what business models are being developed by the diversity of firms within the value chain. The main objective of this paper is to study under the GVC approach the evolution of the implementation by automotive manufacturers - also known as Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) - of business models associated with digitalization. The paper contributes to understanding how the configuration of the Mobility value chain and the relationships established between actors condition the offer of digital mobility services by OEMs. This then assists in analyzing the value propositions around MaaS, the evolution and short-term direction of digital mobility business models, and projections of a medium- to long-term future vision (to 2030, 2040, and 2050). \n\nIn pursuit of its research objective, this paper is structured into four sections. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework of the relevant digital business models as well as the GVC approach to Mobility. In the third section, the research methodology is given in detail. The results of the four OEMs under analysis are presented in Section 4. These results are then discussed, leading to the paper's main conclusions and an overview of future challenges and recommendations. \n\nScientific articles related to business models have been written without interruption since the 1950 s, but they have taken on special relevance in recent years (Taipale-Eravala, ¨ Salmela and Lampela, 2020; Medina, Mazaira and Al´en, 2022). Insofar as a business model is put into practice with a clear focus on value creation (Palos-S´anchez et al., 2021), it should allow the structuring of new value propositions, the identification of market segments, and some definition of the structure of the relevant value chain (Michelini and Fiorentino, 2012; Kraus et al., 2019), along with traditional aspects such as customer focus (Gordijn and Akkermans, 2001; Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010; Amit and Zott, 2001).

{"doc_id": 55, "text": "The importance of digitalization in contemporary business models has been opening new spaces for value creation (Kraus et al., 2019; P´erez-Moure et al., 2023), as the use of digital tools in business models carries an essential weight and results in diverse service options \n(Taipale-Era¨vala, Salmela and Lampela, 2020). New models related to digitalization arise around new capabilities that bring a series of 2 changes associated with new information and communication technologies (ICTs), which allow the reformulation of a value proposition to the customer (Vangjel, 2021). As the real needs of customers evolve and new actors emerge to meet them, some reformulations will exert influence over the value chain (Berman, 2012). Without these new digital business models, it would be impossible to gain an understanding of future contexts (Turienzo, Cabanelas and Lampo´n, 2022; Ancillai et al., 2023; Shen, Sun and Parida, 2023). \n\nAt the same time, certain studies have highlighted the importance of servitization in current business models (Shashishekar, Anand and Paul, 2022). Various contemporary business models stem from the need to deal with a market where competition is strengthening, and this implies that companies (especially the most innovative) are focusing their value propositions on servitization (Schaeffer, 2017; Ruiz de la Torre and Sanchez, ´ 2022; You, Sarpong and O'Regan, 2022). In the context of Mobility, all these changes have led to what is known as 'Mobility as a Service' (MaaS) - a user-centric model for mobility that includes assorted personalized and customized services (based chiefly on ICTs) and that each company approaches in its own way (Jittrapirom et al., 2020; Arias-Molinares and García-Palomares, 2020; Becker et al., 2020).1 Mobility technologies related to digitalization are currently reconfiguring the automotive industry and giving rise to new opportunities and business models (Gschwendtner, Sinsel and Stephan, 2021; Llopis-Albert, Rubio and Valero, 2021). The servitization of CAVs, digital platforms, and connectivity are among the most prominent elements of these mobility technologies (Butler, Yigitcanlar and Paz, 2021; Steinberg, 2022; Hind, Kanderske and van der Vlist, 2022; Cabanelas et al., 2023). As a result, these technologies are having a direct impact on the way connected and autonomous vehicles are used, while the related businesses models are significantly transforming the market in the automotive industry (Barreto, Amaral and Baltazar, 2020). \n\nIn short, in recent years, multiple business models have emerged that depend largely on the type of industry and value chain in which they are developed, where digitalization plays a fundamental role (Turienzo, Cabanelas and Lampon, ´ 2023). Other aspects of certain importance include value creation, collaboration, and the strong competition encountered in new market niches (Guzman- ´ Cuevas, Caceres-Carrasco ´ and Soriano, 2009), and this leads to a focus on the value chain and the relationships built among its actors to satisfy customer demand. \n\nThe global value chain is defined as the full range of activities that different actors perform to bring a product/service from conception to end use (Gereffi and Fernandez-Stark, 2011). Thus, the global value chain of a given industry is configured by two elements: the activities that define the distribution of value along the chain, and the key actors that perform those activities (Nicovich, Dibrell and Davis, 2007; Sturgeon et al., 2009). The GVC approach was developed to analyze the relationships among actors who specialize in distinct segments of a global value chain (Yi, 2003; Sturgeon, Van Biesebroeck and Gereffi, 2008). Concepts such as subcontracting, cooperation, and fragmentation of the value chain have become central elements in GVC analysis (Humphrey and Memedovic, 2003), involving specialized actors and how they cooperate and exchange knowledge (Humphrey and Memedovic, 2003; Gereffi, Humphrey and Sturgeon, 2005).

{"doc_id": 56, "text": "The GVC approach has most often been used to analyze the traditional automotive industry value chain (Humphrey and Memedovic, 2003; Sturgeon, Van Biesebroeck and Gereffi, 2008; Lampon, ´ Cabanelas and Delgado-Guzm´an, 2018), with much research focused on the product (vehicle), examining the configuration of a related production network (e.g., components, modules, systems) \nand the manufacturing processes employed in construction of the vehicle (Sturgeon, Van Biesebroeck and Gereffi, 2008). Also subject to analysis are the diverse relationships between an OEM and its suppliers (Ozatagan, 2011; Schmitt and Van Biesebroeck, 2017; Lampon, ´ Rodríguez-De La Fuente and Fraiz-Brea, 2022). In this traditional value chain, the OEMs control the key value-added activities (e.g., vehicle design, motorization) and coordinate their suppliers through asymmetrical power relationships, determining most of the conditions for production and supply (e.g., location, quality standards, product design) (Humphrey and Schmitz, 2002; Sturgeon, Van Biesebroeck and Gereffi, 2008). \n\nThe current technological and social context raises new questions about global value chains (You, Sarpong and O'Regan, 2022). \n\nActors in these value chains must confront a large number of challenges in different areas, particularly in terms of how to adapt disruptive technologies (Malanowski et al., 2021; Loonam and O'Regan, 2022) and transparently share information (Manfredi and Capik, 2022). Among these challenges, emphasis is placed on the profound transformation that digitalization foments and on the need to integrate knowledge and technologies to generate value for customers (You, Sarpong and O'Regan, 2022). \n\nTechnological, economic, and social changes have been driving the automotive industry to incorporate technologies and companies considered non-traditional (Bezai et al., 2021; Turienzo, Cabanelas and Lampon, ´ 2022). Changes include the prominence of information and communication technologies (e.g., connectivity and the autonomous vehicle) (Fournier et al., 2017; Bezai et al., 2021), \nreactions to social trends (e.g., 'peak car') (Focas and Christidis, 2017), and customer preferences (e.g., on-demand mobility) (Lagadic, Verloes and Louvet, 2019). \n\nThis Mobility value chain is focused not on the traditional product (vehicle) but on services linked to digitalization, specifically once the vehicle has been produced and is in the hands of the customer. From the GVC approach, analysis of the Mobility value chain must include: an identification of the elements that configure it (activities and actors) (Sturgeon et al., 2009); the prevailing types of relationship in terms of control and dependence; and the distribution of power among actors (Yi, 2003; Sturgeon, Van Biesebroeck and Gereffi, 2008). In terms of activities, the GVC approach proposes identification of those that define the distribution of value along the chain (Sturgeon et al., 2009). In this case, the main activities would be key services (and associated business models) linked to digitalization that offer value-added for customers in the realm of mobility. The most relevant services indicated by prior works are mobility solutions for CAVs (Zhou et al., 2021; Cabanelas et al., 2023), services based on digital platforms (Jacobides et al., 2018; Steinberg, 2021), and services linked to connectivity and data exchange (Krafft et al., 2021; Hind, Kanderske and van der Vlist, 2022) as well as to car-sharing (Svennevik, Dijk and Arnfalk, 2021). All these services are mentioned in the literature as being crucial to future scenarios for Mobility (Barreto, Amaral and Baltazar, 2020; Tori, Te Boveldt and Keseru, 2023).

{"doc_id": 57, "text": "As regards the actors involved, in addition to traditional OEMs, various non-traditional automotive firms are part of the Mobility value chain (Bezai et al., 2021; Turienzo, Cabanelas and Lampon, ´ 2022). The GVC definition includes those actors that work to bring a product from conception to end use (Gereffi and Fernandez-Stark, 2011), and the Mobility value chain must further include those actors offering related services (e.g., car-sharing firms, digital platform service providers) as well as those linked to the development of technologies that support such services (e.g., vehicle connectivity software, positioning and localization technologies) (Novikova, 2017; Guyader and Piscicelli, 2019). \n\nIn addition to chain configuration, the types of relationships among actors in a value chain will be key to its study (Pietrobelli and Saliola, 2008). Relationships are traditionally considered in terms of control, dependence, and decision-making power (Sturgeon, Van Biesebroeck and Gereffi, 2008). Previous works on the traditional automotive industry noted that OEMs have long exerted control over value-added activities, with great decision-making power within the value chain and low dependence on suppliers (Humphrey and Schmitz, 2002). From the GVC approach (Sturgeon et al., 2008) in the case of the Mobility value chain, this traditional low dependency and high decision-making power would extend to a greater number of digital activities and services. \n\nIn summary, digitalization has been reshaping the traditional automotive value chain, prompting manufacturers to offer services to meet new mobility needs and to control those activities that generate value for customers (Cabanelas et al., 2023). In this context, to better understand the future of mobility business models linked to digitalization, it will be crucial to identify how traditional OEMs have been adapting, as well as what relationships are being established with the numerous actors that configure the Mobility value chain (Schwabe, 2020). \n\nA qualitative methodology (multiple case study) was chosen for this work. As regards the sample size for analysis, no exact number of cases need be selected in this methodology. Certain authors of reference have recommended no fewer than three (Yin, 2014) and no more than five (Creswell, 2014); because a case study has the capacity to analyze all the data collected, a very large number does not facilitate optimal management of that information, while a small number may fail to represent the reality of the universe under study \n(Cassell, Cunliffe and Grandy, 2018). \n\nIn this case, four automotive manufacturers were selected: Volkswagen, Stellantis, Toyota, and Honda. These four OEMs invest the most in innovation in technologies linked to Mobility as a Service (PwC, 2018). Furthermore, in terms of revenue, Volkswagen, Toyota, and Stellantis top the charts, while Toyota and Honda rank first in the number of cars sold (Thread in Motion, 2021, Focus2Move, 2023). To perform a detailed analysis of a small number of companies, the case study approach allows for thorough description as well as the comprehension and exploration of observable facts without the rigidity characteristic of a quantitative approach (Yin, 2014). Table 1 presents the data for the four companies analyzed. \n\nWhen taking the GVC approach, two variables are key: the activities that define the distribution of value along the chain, and the actors that perform those activities (Sturgeon et al., 2009). In terms of such activities, our research is focused on those key services (associated business models) linked to digitalization that offer value-added for mobility customers. These business models are: \n1. Servitization of CAVs: business models related to digital solutions for mobility with CAVs, such as the logistics of goods (Leminen et al., 2022) or advanced data-assisted solutions (e.g., improved driving experience, traffic flow and safety) (Stocker and Shaheen, 2018). \n\nAs regards actors, in addition to the OEMs at the center of analysis, also considered here are actors that offer relevant services and those that develop the technologies that support such services (Novikova, 2017; Guyader and Piscicelli, 2019). Moreover, depending on how these actors establish relationships with the OEMs, mainly by way of cooperation2 (Humphrey and Memedovic, 2003; Gereffi, Humphrey and Sturgeon, 2005), a classification can be made as follows: \n1. Services providers: external firms that offer services related to mobility exclusively through a transactional relationship with the OEM. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0016328723002136-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 58, "text": "Finally, understanding MaaS as a user-centric mobility model based on information and communications technologies (Jittrapirom et al., 2020), this research focuses on the value propositions offered by OEMs in terms of digital mobility services. \n\nTo obtain information for business case studies, investigators commonly seek primary sources from the companies (Meyer, 2001), \nparticularly as might be obtained through tools like interviews or focus groups (Roulston and Choi, 2018). In this case, the required information derives from large multinationals, involving various departments and contact with numerous geographically dispersed persons - too complex a situation for the employment of such tools. Thus, it was decided to collect data through secondary (internal) \nsources developed by the companies themselves and made publicly available (e.g., corporate reports, internal technical documents) \n(Srinivasa and Rajat, 2012) along with other data elaborated by external bodies (e.g., the specialized press, sectorial documents) (Ellen, Day and Davies, 2018). Although this approach loses the main advantage of primary sources (such as the accuracy of information derived from direct contact and observation), systematic application of this research process to secondary sources can obtain specific information from experts (Srinivasa and Rajat, 2012; Ellen, Day and Davies, 2018). \n\nIn data collection, an exhaustive review was undertaken of more than 300 documents, identified through keywords. Specifically, in addition to the names of the OEMs, the following words were included in this search: \"business model\", \"new mobility\", \"connectivity\", \"car-sharing\", \"digital platform\", \"mobility as a service\", \"data exchange\", \"autonomous mobility\", \"marketplace\", and \"delivery as a service\". In order to identify documents, a process was followed similar to that used by Leminen et al. (2022) and Santos et al. (2023). First, an exhaustive search was made of both internal and external documents, with the use of these two types of sources permitting access to specific and detailed information provided by experts (Ellen et al., 2018; Srinivasa and Rajat, 2012). To guarantee the reliability and quality of the documents obtained, the search concentrated on texts indexed in the EBSCO database3 as well as corporate publications from the OEMs. Following this initial stage, a total of 347 documents were identified; duplicates were 2 Two types of actors are considered in regard to cooperation: providers, establishing an exclusively transactional relationship without cooperation (delivering the request of the customer and billing); and partners, when there is some degree of cooperation (working in collaboration to understand, develop, and execute strategies to improve the results of the transaction) (Osterrieder, 2021). Partners can be OEM-owned companies \n(internal partners). 3 EBSCO is a leading provider of research databases, e-journals, book collections, and e-books for universities, colleges, hospitals, corporations, governments, schools, and public libraries; consulted through the EBSCO Business Source Premier Database. \n\nContent analysis was used in the analysis of data (Prasad, 2008). This allows valid references to be made to a context - i.e., to examine a wide range of information, to interpret such, and to establish results or comparisons with relative objectivity and generalization (White and Marsh, 2006). This type of analysis applied to texts proves ideal when the information-gathering process is complex and includes many sources (Krippendorff, 2018). \n\nDuring content analysis, the collected information on each OEM was structured into the digital mobility business models studied. \n\nThe evolution, short-term direction, and medium- to long-term future vision in the adoption of these business models are all subjected to analysis, along with the actors related to digital services and the technologies that support such services. The results are summarized in two tables: one presents the main value proposition for Mobility and the key aspects and medium- to long-term perspectives of business models; the other shows the relationships between OEMs and actors in terms of dependence and control over key activities. \n\nAdditionally, the *MAXQDA 2022* software was used to establish interrelations among the key concepts (codes) contained in the documents. This software performs a systematic coding of the contents of documents to aid in interpretation, and the coding process consists of tagging and labelling different pieces of information collected (Schreier, 2012). The main objective of the coding process is to understand, identify, and make connections among the data collected by creating different categories (Elliot, 2018; Ngulube, 2015).

This coding made it possible to establish labels based on definitions resulting from the literature (Schreier, 2012); for example, in the case of \"Type_of_Actor\", the labels were: \"Technology_Provider\", \"Technology_Partner\", \"Service_ Provider\", and \"Service_Partner\". \n\nSeveral criteria were set to determine the acceptance or exclusion of elements as codes. By adhering to these criteria, the coding enabled more precise analysis of the data at hand (e.g., by establishing a logical order where a word had to be well-defined and match with key variables) (Punch, 2014; Saldana, ˜ 2009). For instance, the term \"platform\" had to be preceded by \"digital\" to be considered a valid code. This allowed the elimination of potential confusion with other elements such as \"modular platforms\". To ensure the quality and rigor of the coding process, the procedure followed was that recommended by Bryman (2012) and Saldana ˜ (2009). This process included: (1) an initial coding as a quick read of the documents; (2) the creation of an index to facilitate the processing of information and respective labels; (3) an exhaustive review to refine the coding, eliminating or adding elements from the prior initial quick read; and finally (4) a detailed analysis based on this final coding. \n\nThe results produced by way of this software can be presented through various customized outputs. In this research, correlation analyses were performed through code co-occurrence maps that record the interrelation of codes across the lines that connect them. The larger the letters of codes and the thicker the lines, the greater the number of interrelations between codes. \n\nOther business models on offer and related to connectivity include a remote service that allows the use of a phone to lock/unlock the car, adjust the seats, and set the interior vehicle temperature, along with home-systems integration (e.g., enabling devices within a house to turn on when the car is approaching) and software updates to obtain the latest revisions over-the-air and desired features ondemand [VW-7]. This software, named *CARIAD*, is being developed by Volkswagen itself and offers services such as route planning, voice control, and a travel assistant developed by Mobileye [VW-1; VW-6].

By 2030, the company aims to have initiated a transformation centrally focused on services that are tightly integrated with connectivity and software [VW-1]. This transformation will result in the creation of safer and more intelligent vehicles in the long-term. Volkswagen's projections for 2030 are quite ambitious in the deployment of their software and associated services, with a forecast increase to 40 million software-connected vehicles and the expectation of continued growth thereafter [VW-1; VW-6]. 4.1.4. *Car-sharing* Within the car-sharing area of new mobility, Volkswagen is working with two companies dedicated to this type of service: *MOIA* \n[VW-5] and *WeShare.* Both are defined as environmentally friendly ride-pooling systems (fully electric in the case of *WeShare*) with vehicles owned by the company, where customers combine their journeys with others travelling in a similar direction. These include a mobile app for the customer through which passengers can book and pay. Although a plan exists for expansion in future decades [VW3], implementation is currently limited; more than five years after its creation, the service has so far been established only in Berlin, Hamburg, and Hanover [VW-2; VW-9]. This situation may be perceived as indicating a lack of interest by the company in this business model, but the actual intention of Volkswagen is quite different. The sale of *WeShare* to the firm *Miles* aimed at consolidating the company's presence in the shared mobility sector, with *Miles* controlling greater geographic coverage (compared to *WeShare*). This agreement came accompanied by designs for long-term collaboration, where Volkswagen will provide electric vehicles for the *Miles* fleet, demonstrating its continued commitment to shared mobility. This will materialize through the delivery of 10,000 vehicles from Volkswagen to *Miles*, significantly increasing the VW brand's presence within this business model. It is crucial to emphasize that this change does not represent a modification in Volkswagen's intention but rather a strategic adaptation to strengthen its position in the expanding shared mobility market [VW-8]. 4.1.5. *Complementary services* Complementary services based on this OEM's digital platform or on connectivity are diverse. Based on V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) connectivity,6 Volkswagen offers *Traffic Light Information*, which provides drivers in their virtual cockpits with the number of seconds remaining before a traffic light turns green. This system is available in the U.S. and will be operational in Europe in the near future. Indeed, it is already operating in Hamburg, with an underlying expectation of expansion [VW-2]. \n\nThe horizon for launching the service using SAE Level 3 automated driving7 was originally 2025, but this date has been delayed [ST-7]. \n\nIndeed, it seems that this Delivery as a Service autonomous vehicle will not be completely available and functional until the first half of 2030, while Stellantis expects the jump from SAE Level 3 to Level 4 will take place between 2030 and 2040 [ST-8]. \n\nAfter several initiatives and different technology partners, Stellantis is currently supporting its various digital platform business models on *Amazon Web Services* provided by that multinational. Through *Amazon Web Services*, Stellantis is engaging in the marketplace with the aim of directly offering its customers its own warranty services, accessories, on-demand insurance, maintenance, and vehicle rentals [ST-6]. With all these data, Stellantis aims to develop innovative services and to enhance customer value by offering \n\"data as a service\" from 2030 onward [ST-1]. Despite its agreement with Amazon, Stellantis plans to create the Stellantis Corporate Venture Fund, signalling its strategic shift toward developing an in-house platform over the next decade [ST-1]. Additionally, in agreement with Stellantis' electric future vision, the OEM has a B2B platform for support and assistance (e.g., subsidies, taxes, technologies) for companies looking to start their transition to electric mobility [ST-3].

The collaboration between Amazon and Stellantis is introducing customer-centric connected experiences across the brand's vehicles - in particular, through the *STLA SmartCockpit* based on applications that power a rich array of features and services such as trip planning, voice assistance, and payment services; even *Alexa* (Amazon's virtual assistant) is being incorporated into Stellantis vehicles [ST-6]. The drivers are able to choose from among these apps, offered via connectivity and paid through subscription. The *STLA SmartCockpit* as well as the *STLA Brain* will begin implementation in 2024 but will not be fully operational until 2030. Stellantis forecasts more than 34 million connected vehicles by 2030, with services linked to connectivity increasing revenues by US$19.6 billion [ST-1]. \n\nServices associated with electric mobility are also among the pillars of the Stellantis vision. Based on its strategy of zero emissions by 2030, the company is setting up several business models to facilitate the use of its electric vehicles [ST-1; ST-9]. Supported by connectivity technologies and an app that serves as a locator for electric charging stations, Stellantis together with the company 'TheF \nCharging' manage a network with exclusive conditions for Stellantis customers and over 15,000 locations, with 2 million stations in city centers [ST-2; ST-5]. \n\nStellantis owns a company called Free2Move, which offers a fleet of vehicles of Stellantis brands to provide mobility solutions exclusively for professionals [ST-8; ST-9]. Free2Move's own application provides car-sharing, on-demand mobility services, and parking space reservation, among other features. These services are available only in two European cities, Paris and Madrid. Nevertheless, Stellantis expects Free2Move to expand over the next decade (2030–2040) [ST-9]. \n\nFurthermore, Stellantis is backing up this business model by acquiring a car-sharing venture of Mercedes and BMW that launched services of this type. Through the *Share Now* app, this company currently allows car-sharing to 3.4 million customers in 16 European cities [ST-10]. \n\nToyota's servitization of CAVs is being extensively developed through different subsidiaries and alliances with other companies. \n\nToyota is collaborating with *Pony.ai* in the development of a virtual assistant (*Guardian*) as well as tests in Beijing and Shanghai in order to launch an autonomous vehicle [TO-14]. Other results include the *e-palette* for the movement of both people and goods in an autonomous manner [TO-3]. An *Autonomous Mobility Management System*, supported by a mobile app, allows the assignment of various tasks such as door-to-door deliveries; this is expected to be fully implemented in the final stage of 2030 [TO-3; TO-6; TO-9; TO-15]. The autonomous vehicle for these deliveries is already in circulation in one city in Japan (Woven) and is projected to be deployed in the short term in the main cities of that country [TO-3; TO-12;]. This existing door-to-door service works with companies such as Amazon, Pizza Hut, and especially Uber. Facing 2040, the company expects to fully deploy the *Autono-MaaS* concept [TO-12; TO-15], a new vehicle platform compatible with third-party autonomous driving kits and sensors (\"Autono\") for use in mobility applications (\"MaaS\"). \n\nToyota has developed its own digital *Mobility Service Platform*. The company is also collaborating with Amazon as a technology partner, although the platform remains Toyota's own [TO-2; TO-9]. The use of different devices to store data which are then processed by Toyota allows services to be offered directly to the customer, also permitting third parties to extend their own offers through the platform (to be based on *Amazon Web Services* functions). Offers include tailored maintenance plans, flexible leasing, and on-demand insurance (in collaboration with the MS&AD Insurance Group's Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance Company) [TO-2; TO-8; TO-9].

This system integrates various services for connectivity such as over-the-air software updates, authentication systems, maps, virtual assistants, and automatic adjustment of the vehicle's interior conditions [TO-2; TO-4; TO-6; TO-8]. Similarly, key encryption via smartphone and continuous emergency services (route and driving recommendations) are enabled through different devices, including the *Trans-Log* and Smart Key Box that configure the *Early detection, Early resolution* system [TO-8; TO-9]. \n\nCar-sharing is a fundamental business model for Toyota, and the OEM owns several companies to provide such services: Toyota Share, Hui, and Kinto [TO-2; TO-10; TO-11]. In all these cases, the fleets of vehicles belong to Toyota, but there are differences among them. Toyota Share operates only in Japan and is B2C in type, relying on an app to offer on-demand services. Hui is operating in partnership with Servco Pacific in the U.S., with operations similar to Toyota Share but currently available only in Hawaii [TO-2]. \n\nKinto is operating in Europe and is aimed at both B2B and B2C activity. This is part of Toyota's global 2040 vision to evolve into a mobility company by providing all sorts of services related to transporting people around the world [TO-10; TO-11]. This firm makes vehicles available to companies for car-sharing while also connecting end-users through its mobile app, developed in cooperation with Ridecell; it is currently available in Dublin, Venice, Copenhagen, Madrid, Santiago de Chile, and Buenos Aires [TO-2; TO-11]. \n\nToyota has also acquired portions of the car-sharing companies Grab (investing US$1 billion) and Didi (US$600 million) [TO-5; TO7]. Grab operates throughout Southeast Asia (218 cities), where it is the leading company (6 million trips per day), and Didi operates in the Chinese market. The aim of these acquisitions is to insert the company's own vehicle brands into these car-sharing fleets in the short term, and especially (and even more importantly) to obtain future data linked to this service [TO-7]. \n\nGiven Toyota's strong commitment to autonomous driving, complementary services are moving in this direction. Among the most innovative is the \"door-to-door doctor\" service, which uses the *e-palette* model and its app. Here the user would request medical service through the *e-Palette Task Assignment Platform (e-TAP*) application, and the vehicle would drive autonomously to their home. The autonomous vehicle model also allows space for integration of a medical room inside [TO-9]. \n\nHonda is at a relatively early stage, developing an autonomous vehicle with Cruise as its strategic partner. This vehicle began tests in Japan and is focused on passenger mobility. Honda forecasts that this vehicle will be officially on the road in the first half of 2030 [HO-7]. At the same time, together with Teito Motors and Kokusai, another autonomous vehicle in development and currently operating only in Tokyo is focused on shared mobility [HO-5]. \n\nHonda is developing its services with Amazon for improvement of its digital platform. It is using *Amazon Web Services* for technical and commercial support [HO-14] - although Honda calls this platform the *Honda Connected Platform*, its functionalities are in fact offered through *Amazon Web Services*. Services and apps are derived from the capture and analysis of data collected from users of Honda vehicles [HO-13]. Honda anticipates full implementation of this platform by 2030, aiming to establish tripartite interaction involving the environment (infrastructure, traffic…), its MaaS system, and the platform itself. The primary goal is to amass a wealth of data, paving the way for vehicles to achieve complete connectivity with the environment from 2030 onward [HO-3]. The OEM is also currently developing the *Monet* platform with partners including Hino and Softbank to improve the capture of this data. Honda has invested US$2 million in this company (10% of *Monet*'s estimated value) [HO-12; HO-15]. \n\nIn order to increase and improve these services, Honda acquired the company Drivemode, specialized in developing apps linked to vehicle connectivity. Thus Honda hopes to enhance its applications completely by the future horizon of 2030 [HO-10]. It has also created a company with its strategic partner Neusoft to accelerate connectivity-related services in China [HO-9]. One of these apps permits the location of charging points for electric vehicles [HO-1; HO-6] and it is set for broader implementation, such as in taxis in India [HO-6].

The OEM is committed to improving safety, not only on the road but at all levels across coming decades. To this end, it is developing a system that can be used to detect theft and other crimes, reporting them directly to the police. In addition, using artificial intelligence, it is capable of recognizing patterns and prenotifying the authorities. This project is undergoing testing in the city of Kakogawa [HO-1; HO-3]. Furthermore, despite Honda's traditional focus on automobile manufacturing, the company is now actively working to enhance its digital mobility services, with a forward-looking approach aimed at creating new value propositions in anticipation of the year 2050 [HO-3]. \n\nAs a summary of the analyses undertaken in the previous sections, Table 2 presents for each manufacturer the main value proposition for Maas, the most relevant aspects and short-term direction of each business model, and the future medium- to long-term vision for digital mobility. \n\nTable 3 illustrates the relationships between OEMs and their respective technology and services providers and partners in each defined business model, along with a summary of degrees of control and dependence within each company. \n\nIn addition, the code co-occurrence maps resulting from the use of *MAXQDA 2022* software are presented below. Fig. 2 illustrates the interrelationships between each OEM and the various mobility business models. Figures 3a to 3d identify the interrelationships between each of the four OEMs and other actors in the Mobility value chain (technology providers, technology partners, services providers, and services partners). \n\nThese figures illustrate the trends of each manufacturer in a clear and logical manner. Volkswagen focuses on connectivity as the main driver of its value proposition (Fig. 2). It maintains relatively high control over activities and works with few partners, relying on technology providers to develop the business models (Fig. 3a). Stellantis prioritizes both connectivity and digital platforms (Fig. 2), \nworking with Amazon and other providers for development (Fig. 3b), which results in technological dependence on external companies. Toyota is committed to promoting servitization of CAVs and car-sharing in addition to digital platforms and connectivity \n(Fig. 2). It maintains relatively strong control over its core business models while collaborating with different actors in various areas (Fig. 3c). Honda is fully oriented toward digital platforms and connectivity (Fig. 2), with heavy reliance on numerous technology providers and partners (Fig. 3d). \n\nThe results of this research indicate profound shifts in the mobility business models of automotive OEMs as well as in relationships within the Mobility value chain during coming decades. These changes point to the need for future adaptation to emergent business models by actors in the value chain, chiefly due to the introduction of disruptive technologies. In particular, the results confirm that these changes will stem mainly from digitalization (Kraus et al., 2019; Ancillai et al., 2023; Shen, Sun and Parida, 2023) but also from a highly interconnected market structured around the data collection and management, as required to offer high value-added services adapted to users; this market is expected to continue expanding in size and complexity. On the other hand, the extant literature indicates that digitalization does not impact all business models in the same way (Turienzo, Cabanelas and Lampon, ´ 2023). Results show that companies address mobility through differences in their value propositions, with an eye to the short-term, medium-term, and long-term; the influence that digitalization exerts on business models will depend not only on each actor in the value chain but on the relationships established among them. This supports the proposition of some research on digital servitization calling for future studies to embrace dyadic or multi-firm perspectives (as opposed to traditional firm-centric views) to understand how companies are adopting (and will continue to adopt) business models to offer value for customers (Ancillai et al., 2023). \n\nIn regard to business models, the results reveal differences for each case. Services linked to servitization of CAVs are being addressed by all the OEMs, and this is in line with other research findings (Leminen et al., 2022; Ruiz de la Torre and Sanchez, ´ 2022; You, Sarpong and O'Regan, 2022). Moreover, results indicate that servitization will mainly be focused on business models related to fleet services (e.g., logistics of goods) (Leminen et al., 2022) rather than models related to advanced-data-assisted solutions (e.g., ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0016328723002136-main.md"}

Results confirm how these platforms enable OEMs to carry out transactions related to different mobility solutions (Cusumano, Gawer and Yoffie, 2019; Steinberg, 2022), but they also indicate the necessity of interrelations among multiple value chain actors to pursue these digital business models, not only for the near future but for longer time horizons. This seems to be common knowledge among the OEMs - there is an evident collective effort toward digitization, with long-term goals already in place. Moreover, these firms are aware that by 2030, nearly one-third of their profits will derive from these initiatives. Many technology players and service providers are involved in developing the functionalities and exploiting the mobility solutions linked to digital platforms. Therefore, these digital platforms involve diverse actors that should be aligned in order to realize value propositions in the future; some authors have referred to such alignments as \n\"ecosystem business models\" (de Vasconcelos Gomes et al., 2023). \n\nFurthermore, the OEMs are offering multiple personalized services that will enhance user experiences linked to connectivity, including for purposes of better car usage (e.g., information on vehicle condition, remote maintenance services) and entertainment (e. \n\nThe results highlight the notion that companies that obtain (and can manage and employ) data - as by means of systems installed in connected vehicles of certain brands - will have a better capacity to develop business models based on that data during coming decades \n(e.g., digital platforms, services linked to connectivity). The OEMs are betting on the potential of data as a service. In fact, certain initiatives (such as the acquisition of car-sharing companies) are now being implemented to obtain future data linked to this development. Moreover, the commitment to data generation and exploitation and the goal of amassing a greater wealth of data are included in the future visions of these OEMs. \n\nDespite the importance underscored by previous works on the share-economy and on capacity-generation in new business models \n(Berman, 2012; Kraus et al., 2019), the results here presented indicate that initiatives being implemented by OEMs have a low impact in terms of market penetration. In particular, OEMs are aware that future scenarios for urban mobility will necessarily require car-sharing services (Mounce and Nelson, 2019), and they are promoting initiatives along those lines; but according to the findings, current markets remain poorly developed and concentrated into very few cities. These results can be explained by the strong competition present in those markets (Guzman-Cuevas, ´ Caceres-Carrasco ´ and Soriano, 2009). In a highly competitive setting of major technological disruption, being the first to offer certain services demanded by users will be a key element in leading the associated business models. \n\nIn terms of the relationships observed within the Mobility value chain, digitalization continues to be highly impactful, and it is expected that this trend will both continue and intensify during the next decade. Indeed, the results suggest a paradigm shift from a \n\nRecent analyses of digital business models are focusing on the internal resources and capabilities of firms to adapt their value propositions in a dynamic technological environment (Teece, 2019; Lanzolla and Markides, 2021). Contingency theory (Lanzolla and Markides, 2021) and Dynamic Capabilities theory (Teece, 2019; Cabanelas et al., 2023) are serving as the main theoretical approaches to explain the adoption of digital mobility business models. The present research instead adopts the GVC approach as a theoretical framework to analyze these business models linked to digitalization, with emphasis on how OEMs are implementing such models. This approach allows the integration of other variables and actors into analysis, beyond the resources and capabilities internal to firms, thereby examining the broader question of which business models are being developed by the diverse firms within the Mobility value chain. Moreover, this approach is also useful for forecasting trends and future scenarios. The method of analysis based on the GVC approach focuses on the activities that define the distribution of value along the chain and the actors that perform those activities, thus assisting in the identification of medium- to long-term future visions for digital mobility business models.

{"doc_id": 65, "text": "On the other hand, digitalization is reconfiguring not only mobility business models but also traditional relationships among actors in the value chain. In these relationships, OEMs are less able to control value-added activities and must accept a certain level of dependence on other actors. Powerful actors such as technology suppliers are taking advantage of opportunities while playing a vital role that, according to the results, will not likely diminish in the short-term. Indeed, decision-making power among value chain participants will likely be distributed more widely, and the decision-power structure will grow increasingly diffuse in coming decades. \n\nHaving closely reviewed the results of this research, significant implications become apparent for the long-term future. Despite prevalent uncertainty, it is now widely acknowledged that a substantial portion of the revenue of OEMs will derive from digital sources by the year 2030. The trend toward greater digitalization and servitization is compelling mobility companies to re-evaluate their approach toward 2040 and 2050. These companies will no longer be solely automotive manufacturers but will progressively transform into digital mobility enterprises. In this context, OEMs should focus investments on their own technological innovations, or on the acquisition of technologies, especially around business models where the results show comparatively better degrees of adoption - in digital platforms, services linked to connectivity, and related complementary services. Moreover, OEMs should promote and develop strategic partnerships with key technology and service firms, dependence on which will condition the final adoption of digital mobility services. Here an exhaustive process of evaluation of current partnerships and a selection of potential future partners would be recommended. \n\nOn the one hand, the shift in digitalization strategy also has geographical implications, as countries with higher levels of digitalization become more attractive to mobility companies seeking strategic partnerships. In fact, results highlight that digital mobility services are being (and will continue to be) more broadly implemented in developed countries (Japan, the U.S., European nations). Extending the time-frame to 2050, all countries (and especially less developed ones) should accelerate and enhance digitalization efforts in order to strengthen the future adoption of these digital business models. On the other hand, policies for decarbonization seem to be having a positive impact on digitalization and servitization - a key aspect, given that decarbonization will remain a clear priority until at least 2050. The results show that the deployment of electric vehicles has been accompanied by certain digital mobility services such as environmentally friendly car-sharing (ride-pooling systems), location of charging points through connectivity, remote battery monitoring (charge levels and performance), electric driving efficiency services that reward drivers with sustainable habits, and platforms to support companies in their transition to electric mobility. \n\nFinally, additional analysis of long-term developments would assist in the drawing of robust recommendations and the suggestion of future lines of research in the field. Of particular interest would be insights into how cooperative relationships might be established with key actors, along with the definition of a better framework for collaboration. Such a framework should derive from in-depth analysis of key elements found in agreements (typology, terms and conditions, practices developed) currently established by OEMs and other actors, as well as impact-analysis of the performance of particular business models, considering both traditional metrics (such as quality of service or customer satisfaction) and digital metrics (such as online capabilities or the number online subscribers). \n\nData sources. \n\nPerez-Moure ´ **Hugo:** Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing. \n\nLampon ´ **Jesús F.:** Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Methodology, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing, Investigation, Validation. **Cabanelas Pablo:** Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - review & editing. \n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\nThis research was funded by Spanish Ministry of Science Innovation and Universities, (grant number: PID2020-116040RB-I00), and by Xunta de Galicia (grant number: GPC-ED431B 2022/10).

However, their operational characteristics, including prolonged charging times and limited travel distances, have introduced complex scheduling challenges that demand innovative solutions. This review paper explores the electric bus scheduling problem (EBSP), comprehensively analyzing state-of-the-art research in this rapidly evolving field. The literature is categorized based on structural and procedural aspects. In the structural section, the different structures of defining EBSP have been explained. Moreover, mathematical models, their associated constraints, and objective functions are examined. The procedural section reviews various solution methodologies based on the underlying objective functions. The review reveals potential avenues for future research, such as investigating multi-depot and multi-vehicle configurations, incorporating charge scheduling and partial charging, developing robust schedules to account for uncertainty, and applying advanced techniques like machine learning and hyper-heuristics to optimize electric bus transportation efficiency. \n\nWith the increasing emphasis on sustainability and environmental concerns, many transit agencies and operators are transitioning towards electrified public transportation systems, including electric buses \n(Mahmoud et al., 2016). By optimizing the scheduling and operation of electric buses, transit agencies can minimize environmental impact, reduce operating costs, and improve the overall sustainability of public transportation systems (Li et al., 2020). Hence, The electric bus scheduling problem (EBSP) is a specialized variant of the VSP that specifically addresses the unique characteristics and constraints associated with electric bus fleets (Sung et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2019). The EBSP is a critical issue in the transition to electric public transportation systems, Public transportation is experiencing a global transition to electric propulsion. In recent years, urban areas have increasingly adopted battery-powered electric buses (EBs) as part of their existing bus fleets to maintain a sustainable economic environment (Wang et al., 2020; Wenz et al., 2021). Unlike conventional internal combustion buses, EBs must consider distances and charging times as a component of their scheduling. Thus, electric bus scheduling problems are crucial due to the significant differences in dynamic and driving characteristics between electric and traditional buses. By understanding and addressing these differences, efficient and effective scheduling strategies can be developed to optimize electric buses' operation and ensure smooth and reliable public transportation services. \n\nThe vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) is a well-known optimization problem encountered in the operational planning of public transportation systems (Bunte & Kliewer, 2009). VSP focuses on optimizing conventional bus scheduling to create efficient and reliable bus schedules that minimize operating costs and fleet size while maximizing service quality and passenger satisfaction.

It is important to note that each electric bus (EB) has a limited travel distance after charging, requiring periodic recharging at appropriate intervals while ensuring minimum charging time requirements are met (Amirhosseini & Hosseini, 2018; Reuer et al., \n2015). Integrating electric buses into an urban network poses challenges that require further adjustments to the current bus scheduling process \n(Perumal et al., 2022). \n\nThis paper aims to review existing literature on the problem of electric bus scheduling and solution methods. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art results of the electric bus scheduling problem in terms of structural and procedural aspects. It also describes the importance of considering charge scheduling while dealing with electric bus scheduling problems. Additionally, it presents a comprehensive literature review of mathematical models, including different constraints and objective functions. It provides a classification of objectives that, to the best of our knowledge, have never been discussed in previous studies. The solution approaches that are suitable for the different objective functions have been discussed and classified based on objective functions. Finally, the review highlights gaps and potential directions for future research. Fig. 1 illustrates the process of selecting related papers and the classification framework.

Section 5 analyzes gaps in the literature, and finally, Section 6 and 7 states the discussion conclusion. \n\nOver the past few years, electric buses have become increasingly \n\nFurthermore, reducing passenger waiting times in the actual bus operation is important to ensuring smooth departure intervals (Teng et al., \n2020). The electric bus scheduling problem (EBSP) involves efficiently assigning trips from a predetermined transit timetable to the bus fleet in order to reduce fleet size and minimize overall cost (Li et al., 2020; Sung et al., 2022). This addresses the unique characteristics and constraints of electric bus fleets, such as limited driving range, while considering recharging time for an effective schedule (Teng et al., 2020; Van Kooten Niekerk et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2021). \n\nIntegrated problems have become increasingly popular in recent years. Fig. 2 shows the overview of electric bus scheduling papers and their main related problems. \n\nBased on the literature, several issues can be integrated into the electric bus scheduling problem for a more cost-effective schedule (Perumal et al., 2022). For example, Perumal et al. (2021), Sistig and Sauer (2023), and Xie et al. (2023) investigated the integration of electric bus and crew scheduling problems to reduce costs further and improve efficiency in bus transportation. The results underscore the importance of incorporating crew scheduling constraints into local frameworks for bus fleet electrification decisions. Duan et al. (2023) and Fan et al. (2023) integrated timetabling and electric bus scheduling problems, focusing on minimizing peak power demand simultaneously and operational costs. \n\nAnother essential problem when substituting electric fleets with conventional buses needs to be considered is the charging infrastructure placement problem, which includes charging station location and capacity problems, whether considering charging along routes or plug-in charging at depots (Messaoudi & Oulamara, 2019). In each charging station, which is mainly located at terminals or depots, three characteristics are defined: (1) location depends on the ground prices, the cooperation of local authorities, and the availability of a high-power electricity connection, (2) space capacity related to a maximum number of vehicles can be charged at once, and (3) energy capacity which is defined as the higher capacity can charge electric vehicles (Van Kooten Niekerk et al., 2017). Integration of electric bus scheduling with this problem can be seen in Li et al. (2019), Hu et al. (2021), Wang et al. (2022), He et al. (2023b) and Avishan et al. (2023). \n\nThe electric bus fleet investment problem determines the number of required electric buses, which are different in capacity from batteries \n(Rogge et al., 2018). For more details, see Chao and Xiaohong (2013), \nRogge et al. (2018), Jiang et al. (2018), Li et al. (2019), Yao et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2020), Avishan et al. (2023), and Li et al. (2024). The charging infrastructure investment problem decides which charging facility to deploy and/or how many chargers need to be purchased to minimize the fixed cost of the electric fleet (Pelletier et al., 2019).

This problem optimizes the cost of charging by considering time-of-use prices and the capacity of the charging station. In other words, charging scheduling minimizes operational costs by integrating charging activities into electric bus operations (Hu et al., 2021).

{"doc_id": 69, "text": "The two main classes are the single-depot electric bus scheduling problem (SD-EBSP) and the multiple-depot electric bus scheduling problem (MD-EBSP). Each can be extended to another category: multiple vehicle types (MVT). Due to the increase in the complexity of the problem, we can see MVT problems have been used rarely in previous studies. In addition, this classification can go further and consider a pure electric bus fleet or in combination with conventional buses. Furthermore, some studies considered just one route to evaluate their proposed solving method. However, considering multiple routes is more realistic than just one route. Each category will be discussed and referred to the related studies. \n\nGiven a bus depot, SD-EBSP assigns a vehicle to a set of scheduled trips with predetermined start, end, and travel times. It is possible to solve the single-depot problem in polynomial time (Alamatsaz et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2019). Due to simplifying the problem, SD-EBSP has been considered more than MD-EBSP.

Notably, Gao et al. (2013) and Janovec & Koh´ani (2019) \naddressed the crucial aspect of minimizing the number of required electric buses by developing a scheduling model that considers both driving range, charging time, and battery capacity limitations. In addition, some studies consider strategic factors such as electricity prices and EBSP combined with charging scheduling to minimize both bus usage and associated charging costs. (Duan et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2021; Messaoudi & Oulamara, 2019; Shu et al., 2021; Teng et al., 2020; Van Kooten Niekerk et al., 2017). The literature also reflects a growing awareness of uncertainties in travel time and energy consumption due to various factors such as urban traffic, weather, and route conditions. These uncertainties can be solved by considering a robust, stochastic, or dynamic approach (Zaneti et al., 2022). We can refer to Tang et al. \n\nIn conclusion, recent research in electric bus scheduling and optimization has demonstrated a comprehensive focus on minimizing costs and enhancing efficiency. Scholars have tackled various factors, including driving range, charging time, electricity prices, battery parameters, seasonal variations, and operational constraints. These studies have opted for a single-depot electric bus scheduling problems (SDEBSP) framework, employing homogeneous electric buses in a pure electric fleet configuration. However, while these studies provide valuable insights, there is room for further research to extend these models to address the complexities of multiple depots, heterogeneous fleets, or hybrid configurations, ensuring a better understanding of electric bus fleet management challenges and opportunities. As a result, the following sections will deal with these topics. \n\nThe multiple depot vehicle scheduling problem (MDVSP) is an extension of the SDVSP, where multiple bus depots are present in the city network. A vehicle schedule must start and end at the same depot, and the number of vehicles available at each depot is restricted. The MDVSP is known to be an NP-hard problem. Due to the increase in traffic, transit operators must expand their facilities, so it is more common to have multiple depots (Zhang et al., 2022). The multi-depot is an important subject in electric bus scheduling problems since vehicles can be shared among different/multiple bus routes throughout the day to balance their carrying capacity (Guo et al., 2019). However, the MD-EBSP is more complicated and challenging to solve in comparison with SD-EBSP, and both the exact algorithm (Jahic et al., 2021) and heuristic algorithm have been applied to solve it (Sung et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). In MD-EBSP, a vehicle schedule must start and end at the same depot, and the number of vehicles available at each depot is limited (Perumal et al., 2022). In the following, the MD-EBSP in the pure electric fleet will be discussed in detail. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S221067072400324X-main.md"}

This approach swiftly delivered acceptable solutions for large-scale instances and optimal solutions for smaller-scale scenarios. The study considered a linear relationship between charge amount and recharge time, with a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the impact of driving range and charging rate variations on total deadheading distance and charging operations. Guo et al. (2019) and Wang et al.

The research presented two equivalent mathematical formulations based on the deficit function theory and a bi-objective integer programming model with aims of minimizing the total required EBs and chargers. Li et al. (2020) proposed an improved adaptive genetic algorithm for scheduling EBs and deploying chargers, efficiently utilizing resources, and saving investments. The focus is on optimizing the scheduling of EBs and the deployment of stationary chargers, considering partial charging policies and time-of-use electricity prices to minimize overall system costs.

It aims to minimize charging, battery replacement, and carbon emission costs. \n\nThe studies reviewed highlight effective approaches for addressing the challenges of the Multi-Depot Electric Bus Scheduling Problem, primarily focusing on homogenous fleets with the same battery capacity. Extending the investigation to encompass heterogeneous fleets with varying battery capacities allows for a more flexible approach to address operational constraints and route demands, enhancing overall system efficiency. In the following section, this branch of EBSP and related studies will be discussed. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S221067072400324X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 71, "text": "According to Fig. 3, multiple vehicle types are rarely discussed in single- or multiple-depot electric bus scheduling problems. Based on Table 1, we can refer to Chao & Xiaohong (2013), He et al. (2023b), \nRogge et al. (2018), Sistig & Sauer (2023), Zhang et al. (2023a), which are single-depot, multi-vehicle type, electric bus scheduling problem (SD-MVT-EBSP) and Duda et al. (2022), Jahic et al. (2021), Jiang et al. (2018), Sung et al. (2022), Yao et al. (2020), Zhang et al. (2021a, 2022), and Avishan et al. (2023) which are multi-depot, multi-vehicle type, electric bus scheduling problem (MD-MVT-EBSP). In the MVT problems, it is more common to consider electric bus fleet investment problems in combination with electric bus scheduling (Chao & Xiaohong, 2013; Jahic et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2018; Rogge et al., 2018; Sung et al., \n2022; Yao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021a; Zhang et al., 2022). In this kind of integrated problem, EBs will be assigned to a set of timetabled trips while the number of vehicle types with different battery capacities will be optimized. Furthermore, one of the objectives will be minimizing capital investment for the electric fleet or the cost of EB purchasing. \n\nGenerally, when EBs with CNG/ diesel buses or hybrid buses are used in public transit, we face a mixed fleet optimization problem. The characteristics of vehicles need to be considered, and not only will the energy consumption be minimized, but the cost of emission should also be minimized to have the best composition of EBs and conventional buses in the fleet. EBs can be homogenous in the mixed fleet (Alvo et al., \n2021; Li, 2014; Li et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2021; Moradipari et al., 2020; Olsen et al., 2022; Paul & Yamada, 2014; Reuer et al., 2015; Rinaldi et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) or heterogeneous (Duda et al., 2022; Sistig & Sauer, 2023; Sung et al., 2022). The main objective is maximizing travel distance and minimizing the number of required buses while the operational costs are at least (Li, 2014; Paul & Yamada, 2014). \n\nIn the SD-EBSP, we can refer to Reuer et al. (2015), Rinaldi et al. (2020), \nZhou et al. (2020), Moradipari et al. (2020), Alvo et al. (2021), Olsen et al. (2022), and in the MD-EBSP, Li et al. (2019) and Lu et al. (2021) which are implemented in a mixed transit fleet. \n\nDue to the limited battery capacity of electric buses, a recharge is necessary to extend electric buses' driving range to ensure they can make the trips assigned. Without considering the range constraints of electric buses, the electric bus scheduling problem may not be able to produce optimal trip assignment results (Zheng et al., 2023). Recharging trips lead to high power requirements for charging and a high charging cost. As a result, public electric bus systems face new challenges in planning and scheduling since operators must devise reasonable charging scheduling to recharge batteries during daily operations to ensure the economic viability of electric buses (Rong et al., 2021).

{"doc_id": 72, "text": "According to Perumal et al. (2022), EBSP entails allocating electric buses to a series of scheduled trips with a main focus on reducing operational costs mostly including energy usage during serving or deadhead trip costs, waiting costs, driver costs, and investment costs of electric buses. It assumes that the buses charge on demand as soon as they arrive at charging stations. It is obvious that if there is no intelligent scheduling charging, the system will face a load profile with high peak loads that are unevenly distributed and can influence the local grid and equipment dimension (Jahic et al., 2019). However, Charge scheduling involves maximizing the efficiency of charging costs by analyzing time-dependent electricity rates and the electrical demand at charging facilities (Perumal et al., 2022). The charging scheduling problems consider the power price, available charging infrastructure, and fleet charging need to minimize charging costs (Wang et al., 2017). \n\nTherefore, integrating the electric bus scheduling problem, determining which bus takes which route, and charging schedules that decide when and how long the electric bus should be recharged is necessary. \n\nCombining EBSP with charging scheduling optimizes charging activities of electric buses to reduce peak loads and has the potential to decrease charging costs by considering the time-of-use electricity price, thus enhancing the economic sustainability of the fleet (Rong et al., 2021). Integrating charge scheduling into EBSP allows operators to coordinate fleet deployment and charging strategies more effectively, leading to improved resource utilization and cost savings. Consequently, recent research has concentrated on addressing this issue by explicitly considering charging constraints in the scheduling process, resulting in various proposed strategies and models as potential solutions. In this kind of problem charging costs based on time-of-use (TOU) will be minimized. For more information, see Duda et al. (2022), Jiang et al. \n\nDespite electric buses' many benefits, including no gas emissions and reduced noise, urban transport operators worry about their operational range (Messaoudi & Oulamara, 2019). In an actual driving situation, this driving range will decrease by several factors such as air conditioner, driving behavior, traffic conditions, and route topology leading to battery recharging (Jahic et al., 2019; Li, 2016; Mahmoud et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2019). Batteries are one of the most significant components of electric vehicles, which can either be recharged or replaced before they run out (Huang & Li, 2016). Fig. 4 illustrates different charging strategies to maintain a high level of operational service of EBs (Alamatsaz et al., 2022; Rong et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2023b). \n\nTo enhance clarity regarding charging strategies, an explanation of each approach is presented. \n\nPlug-in Charging- This method is one of the popular and welldeveloped charging methods since the installation cost is low. In addition, it has three levels corresponding to slow, regular, and fast charging, and charging time is between 11 and 36, 2–6, and 0.2–1 h, respectively \n(Clairand et al., 2019). Due to time constraints, only the second and third levels can be recommended for charging EBs (Rong et al., 2021). Even though slow and regular charging facilities are located at depots, fast charging facilities can be located at depots, terminals, bus stops, or anywhere else (Fusco et al., 2013). \n\nPantograph Charging- The Pantograph charger is a fast-charging system that enables automatic connectivity. An electric bus can be easily connected to the charger through the pantograph on top of the vehicle \n(Wang et al., 2022). It allows charging at bus stops or terminals (Rong et al., 2021). \n\nWireless Charging- Wireless power infrastructure is installed under \n\nFig. 4. Classification of charging strategies. \n\nBattery Swapping- Before the battery runs out, it will be replaced with a fully charged battery (Li, 2014). By using robots, the process from arrival to service takes 12 min. Maintaining a set of fully charged charging stations is a requirement for this method (Chao & Xiaohong, 2013). \n\nTable 2 provides an analysis of the strengths and limitations associated with each strategy and refers to the related studies as an example.

{"doc_id": 73, "text": "Even though partial recharging makes bus scheduling more flexible, it complicates actual bus operations due to increased recharging frequency (Sung et al., 2022). In a partial recharging strategy, energy can be applied in any amount up to its full capacity. Thus, this strategy can be more practical since full charging may lead to unnecessary charging and, as a result, will increase the fleet size and operational cost (Zhang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023). According to Zhang et al. (2022), partial charging in a multi-depots/vehicles/ routes scenario can reach the optimal schedule with the lowest cost and fleet size in comparison with full charging. \n\nIn this section, a comprehensive literature review on the electric bus scheduling problem (EBSP) is presented, with a summarized overview depicted in Fig. 3. The figure provides a visual depiction of the distribution of research papers within different categories, offering valuable insights into the structural classification of EBSP. The analysis indicates a noteworthy focus on the multiple vehicle types (MVT) approach, a crucial variant of EBSP that deserves further consideration within this context. Notably, MVT proves to be particularly advantageous when faced with fluctuating passenger demand and variable route lengths, leading to the potential development of more optimized schedules. Furthermore, the review underscores a significant gap in the literature pertaining to charge scheduling and partial charging. These strategies, if strategically employed, have the potential to substantially reduce the operational costs of electric fleets. However, it is observed that discussions on these aspects are conspicuously limited within the existing body of research. Therefore, further investigation and research are needed to explore the potential benefits and challenges of MVT, charge scheduling, and partial charging in electric bus scheduling. \n\nThe electric bus scheduling problem considers timetable constraints, \n\nLiterature reviews demonstrate that adding particular conditions to \n\nFig. 6 illustrates the classification of additional constraints. Table 3 indicates how constraints can be measured. These considerations \n\nThe minimization of total cost in electric bus scheduling supports financial concerns and environmental, sustainability, and user affordability goals by balancing economic viability with positive impacts. The adoption of electric buses aims to reduce the environmental impact of public transportation while aligning with broader sustainability objectives. Minimizing operating costs is crucial for achieving cost efficiency and ensuring the long-term viability of the electric bus system. Other significant objectives and constraints may also play a role depending on context and goals. Some additional objectives and constraints to consider might include: \n\nMD-MVT- Due to the growing problem of traffic congestion, transit operators face the challenge of expanding their facilities and implementing multiple depots. Efficient management of these depots is crucial for solving scheduling issues related to electric buses, as vehicles are shared across different routes throughout the day to maximize capacity utilization. This analysis highlights the importance of adopting a MultiDepot, Multiple Vehicle Types approach in addressing the complexities associated with Electric Bus Scheduling Problems. The MVT approach proves valuable, especially in situations where passenger demand fluctuates, and route lengths vary. By embracing this approach, more optimized schedules that consider diverse operational conditions and their specific requirements can be developed more effectively. \n\nCharge scheduling and partial charging- By considering time-of-use electricity prices and the capacity of charging stations, charge scheduling minimizes charging costs (Perumal et al., 2022). Therefore, integrating electric bus scheduling with charge scheduling can enhance the reliability and efficiency of the electric bus fleet. However, there is a lack of integrated studies, specifically when considering MVT (Duda et al., 2022; He et al., 2023b; Sung et al., 2022). Furthermore, previous studies indicated that partial charging could reduce the total cost of the fleet. Thus, it can be recommended that this type of charging in MD-MVT can reach better results since partial charging can avoid unnecessary charging, especially during peak hours.

{"doc_id": 74, "text": "Charging strategy- In the realm of electric bus scheduling, the integration of wireless or pantograph charging technology presents a promising solution to enhance operational efficiency and address key challenges associated with conventional charging methods. These strategies can provide an opportunity for frequent charging since charges are distributed throughout various locations within the road network \n(Janovec & Kohani, 2021). Electric buses can recharge during layovers, minimizing downtime and maximizing operational efficiency. However, it is worth noting that none of the aforementioned studies examined the use of wireless charging. Additionally, only a few employed pantographs in their research (Duda et al., 2022; Gkiotsalitis et al., 2023; Janovec & Kohani, 2021; Olsen & Kliewer, 2020). Including wireless charging is in line with larger sustainability objectives. By utilizing renewable energy sources for wireless charging, cities can decrease their environmental impact and play a role in establishing a greener public transportation system. While the initial investment in wireless charging infrastructure may seem substantial, the long-term benefits include significant cost savings. Operational efficiencies, reduced maintenance costs, and the potential for energy savings contribute to an economically viable and \n\nAdditional constraint- In the electric bus scheduling problem, it is assumed that each EB starts its daily trip with a fully charged battery. However, during a trip, the energy consumption of an EB may be affected by several parameters, such as weather, route, and traffic conditions. They also may affect travel time. Therefore, there is uncertainty regarding energy consumption and travel time. However, a few studies consider this uncertain while optimizing the schedule (Bie et al., 2021; Janovec & Kohani, 2021; Jiang et al., 2021; Shu et al., 2021; Tang et al., \n2019; Xing et al., 2023). It can be seen that there are a lot of studies that consider MD-MVT and the uncertainty of energy consumption. \n\nObjective function- The successful adoption and integration of electric buses into public transit systems require careful consideration of various factors. It can be seen that some of these objectives, including environmental impact, infrastructure constraints (Jahic et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022), and Total Cost of Ownership (Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2023a), are rarely applied. However, considering second-life batteries and disposal, the number of battery replacements during the life span of the electric buses, or the bus depreciation costs can ensure the electric bus sustainability in public transit. Furthermore, considering charging stations' capacity and the total charge demand, which can account for the number of buses that can charge simultaneously and also the number of required charges, can affect the economic viability of electric buses. \n\nSolving approach- There is a notable absence of studies directly comparing the proposed methods and evaluating their outcomes in comparison to alternative approaches. The lack of such comparative analyses emphasizes the novelty and uniqueness of the proposed methodology in addressing the research problem. Additionally, in electric bus scheduling, integrating advanced tools, including hyperheuristics and machine learning techniques, shows significant promise in achieving optimal and efficient outcomes. The application of deep reinforcement learning enables adaptive and dynamic decision-making in real-time based on the system's current state. It can optimize bus schedules by considering factors such as traffic conditions, passenger demand fluctuations, and the availability of charging infrastructure. It can enhance electric buses' energy efficiency by learning to manage energy consumption effectively. This involves deciding when to charge an EB and how much to charge it. As a result, applying this method can improve reliability and on-time performance, enhancing passengers' overall satisfaction using electric buses. \n\nThe comprehensive analysis of the electric bus scheduling and planning problems within the referenced literature offers valuable insights into various aspects of electric bus fleet management.

Case studies provide insights into the benefits of a holistic approach, considering both operational scheduling and the strategic placement of charging infrastructure to maximize system efficiency and reliability. Several studies emphasize the critical importance of striking a balance between fixed and charging costs. Evidence suggests that the adoption of heterogeneous fleets, comprising buses with varying battery capacities and charging requirements, can yield cost advantages over homogeneous fleets. This approach allows for more flexible fleet management and optimized resource allocation, leading to improved overall performance and cost-effectiveness. According to the literature, previous studies commonly used EBs with a battery capacity ranging from 150 to 300 kWh. Partial recharging strategies have emerged as a viable approach to optimizing electric bus fleet operations and charging infrastructure deployment. Studies highlight the benefits of partial recharging in maximizing fleet utilization, minimizing downtime for charging, and optimizing energy consumption while extending battery lifespan. Under time-of-use tariffs, recharging during off-peak periods can significantly reduce operating costs by taking advantage of lower electricity rates. Studies underscore the importance of strategic scheduling to capitalize on favorable charging conditions and minimize energy costs. Neglecting uncertainty effects on energy consumption, such as traffic conditions and passenger demand variability, can disrupt trip schedules and lead to delays or missed trips. Recognizing and accounting for these uncertainties is essential for developing robust scheduling and planning strategies that ensure reliable and efficient electric bus operations. \n\nIn conclusion, the insights gleaned from the referenced case studies provide valuable guidance for policymakers, transit agencies, and researchers in designing and implementing effective electric bus scheduling and planning strategies. By considering the key conclusions highlighted in this discussion, stakeholders can develop informed decisions to enhance the sustainability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of electric bus transit systems. \n\nCities are expected to electrify their bus fleets in the near future, leading to adjustments in existing bus transportation planning.

The integration of V2V communication and CHGA offers valuable insights into vehicle–road dynamics for improved safety across multiple vehicles. In an autonomous intersection traffic control system utilizing V2X communication, an optimizationbased approach ensures safe and efficient vehicle trajectories (Lu et al., 2021). The system can address potential collisions with safety constraints and utilize V2I interaction mechanism to handle communication imperfections such as packet delivery delay and loss. This comprehensive approach optimizes intersection traffic control, leveraging V2X communication for secure and efficient autonomous vehicle interactions. \n\nThe computational intelligence of the AI algorithms can proficiently handle the modeling of humungous data to extract the useful features from them. The excellence of AI algorithms in identifying patterns and correlations within complex datasets enables it to brings advanced capabilities to ITS, allowing for real-time analysis, data-driven decisionmaking, and automation (Boukerche et al., 2020). The ability of AI to manage high-velocity data streams and execute real-time data processing enables ITS to respond promptly to changing situations and optimise traffic flow, thereby enhancing overall system performance. The AI algorithms are broadly classified as Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), Machine learning, Fuzzy Logic, and deep learning shown in Fig. 6. The computational approaches such as EAs, Fuzzy Logic and Machine learning-based AI-approaches have significantly benefited the ITS applications. \n\nEAs are search based optimization algorithms that finds the best optimal solution for a problem using the principles from nature and genetics. In these algorithms, from a pool of solutions, the best solution is identified by the duplication and mutation process which eventually identifies the best optimal solution for a problem (Abbasi et al., 2020). The search methodology for optimal solution varies from one EAs to another. One important characteristics of evolutionary algorithm is that it does not involve complex mathematical modeling and hence could obtain a near best optimal solution in a reasonable time. Genetic algorithm (GA) which is a well-known EAs follows the following procedure as shown in Fig. 7, in the search process for optimal solutions. \n\nThe algorithm of GA in Fig. 5 is as explained below, Initialize or generate an initial population The fitness of each individual in the population to satisfy an objective is evaluated. The individuals with the best fitness value are chosen for mutation and cross over. \n\nThe individuals with the least fitness values are replaced by the new individuals with improves fitness. The search continues by following the above-mentioned steps, until an optimal solution is obtained. \n\nEAs can optimize the timing and coordination of traffic signals in transportation networks. By modeling the traffic flow EAs can adaptively adjust signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions, leading to more effective traffic management. EAs also assist in Route Planning and Optimization by finding optimal routes for vehicles, considering various factors such as traffic congestion, road conditions, and user preferences (Abbasi et al., 2020). They encode each route as individuals in the EAs population and using fitness evaluation based on travel time or other relevant criteria, EAs can evolve route solutions that minimize travel time, fuel consumption, or environmental impact. EAs can evolve efficient and effective routing plans that reduce total distance travelled, improve service levels, and minimize operational costs (Mao et al., 2021). \n\nEAs are additionally appropriate in traffic simulation to investigate the effects of various scenarios and policies on transportation systems. \n\nIts expertise in multi-objective optimisation problems aids in the simultaneous consideration of numerous conflicting objectives in Its (Li et al., 2020a). EAs can optimize transportation systems for multiple criteria, such as minimizing travel time, reducing emissions, and maximizing traffic safety. EAs can explore the trade-offs between these objectives and identify Pareto-optimal solutions that represent a range of optimal trade-offs. EAs can optimize the parameters of transportation models used in ITS, such as traffic simulation models or demand forecasting models. By searching the parameter space effectively, EAs can fine-tune these models, leading to improved accuracy and reliability in predicting traffic behaviour, analysing infrastructure changes, or evaluating policy interventions (Zhang et al., 2018b). \n\nIt is a reasoning process that takes a deformed and uncertain inputs to produce logic outputs which is similar to a human reasoning (Khan and Abbas, 2018). The fuzzy logic systems include all possible logics of inputs into the system to produce definite output. The fuzzy logic architecture comprises of four modules namely as shown in Fig. 8.

This transformation of inputs takes place with the help of a membership function which is a graph that defines a how to represent particular input in the input space with values between 0 and 1. Knowledge Base: It refers to the rule store which stores the If-Then rules suggested by the experts. \n\nInference Engines: This is the brain of the fuzzy system that estimates the best suitable rules for a particular input and fire them accordingly. The fired rules are combined and transformed to controllable actions. Defuzzification: In this phase the fuzzified inputs are transformed back to crisp values based on a suitable defuzzification approach. \n\nFuzzy logic is adept at handling imprecise and uncertain numerical and sequential data in transportation. It provides a framework to handle uncertainty and imprecision in decision-making processes in ITS (Iqbal et al., 2018). Fuzzy logic allows for smooth and continuous traffic control, even in the presence of uncertainties and varying driving conditions. Fuzzy logic is applied to control traffic signals and optimize signal timing in a dynamic and adaptive manner (Ghanbari et al., 2015; Javed et al., 2017). By incorporating real-time traffic data and expert knowledge, fuzzy algorithms can adjust signal timings based on the current traffic conditions, such as traffic flow, congestion, and pedestrian volumes. Fuzzy logic models can handle the inherent uncertainties and variations in traffic behaviour by assigning degrees of membership to different traffic states (e.g., light, moderate, heavy congestion) during prediction of traffic patterns and congestion levels (Ghanbari et al., \n2015). These predictions can then be used for proactive traffic management, route planning, and incident detection. \n\nFuzzy logic-based algorithms are used in adaptive cruise control \n(ACC) systems in vehicles, where it uses sensors to measure the distance and relative speed of the preceding vehicles to adjust the vehicle's acceleration and maintain a safe following distance (Lin and Nguyen, 2019). Fuzzy algorithms can evaluate and rank different route options based on fuzzy rules and linguistic variables, considering factors like travel time, road quality, and congestion levels which helps drivers and navigation systems make informed decisions for efficient and personalized route planning. Fuzzy algorithms enable the modeling of complex systems and capture human-like reasoning, allowing for more effective identification of abnormal patterns and potential incidents, such as accidents, congestion, or adverse weather conditions (Kumar et al., 2020). \n\nThese algorithms can trigger appropriate responses, such as rerouting traffic or dispatching emergency services, based on the severity and impact of the detected incidents. Limitations of the approach involve potential computational complexity in complex systems, reliance on data-driven models, and a lack of standardization in design and tuning methods, leading to performance variability across implementations (Lin and Nguyen, 2019). \n\nML is a popular modelling approach in Big Data where the model is trained to solve a problem a problem through previous data instances without much explicit programming (Abdelrahman et al., 2020). In this, the trained model gets capable of proficiently mining information and extracting patterns from unseen data of the same problem. Machine learning algorithms are broadly classified as, Supervised Algorithms: In this type of machine learning algorithms the data instances are labelled. During the training, the model maps the input with the target to learn a function that maps the input to an output (Abdelrahman et al., 2020). Some of the frequently used supervised ML algorithm in ITS includes Support Vector Machines \n(SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), Linear Regression \n(LR), and so on. Prediction and classification are the two common tasks performed using supervised ML algorithms. \n\nUnsupervised learning: In this type of ML algorithm, the data instances are unlabelled and the model is train to cluster the data instances that share similar grounds (Bacciu et al., 2017). K-means algorithm is a common Unsupervised ML algorithm used in ITS. \n\nDimensionality reduction in big data, clustering group for classification task, identifying hidden structures are some of the common tasks performed using unsupervised ML algorithms.

It comprises of both labelled and unlabelled data for training a model. The model is mostly trained in a manner similar to that of the unsupervised model, but it has a slight advantage over what labelled data could deliver. Machine learning is a powerful tool in ITS, adept at handling various data types. It excels in processing traffic flow data, environmental data, GPS and location data, vehicle detection data, and even text and social media data for sentiment analysis (Sodhro et al., 2019). ML applications in ITS include traffic prediction, anomaly detection, route optimization, smart parking, and public transportation optimization. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyse historical traffic data, sensor readings, and other relevant information to predict traffic patterns, congestion levels, and traffic flow (Stocker et al., 2016). These predictions enable proactive traffic management, real-time adaptive control, and efficient route planning. Machine learning algorithms are also used to perform tasks related to autonomous Vehicle Control and analyse driving behaviour based on data from in to vehicle sensors, telematics, and other sources (Sodhro et al., 2019). These algorithms can identify patterns and assess driver performance, enabling applications such as driver assistance systems, risk assessment, and driver training. \n\nTheir inherent capability to automatically detect and classify incidents from sensor data or real-time feeds enables to recognize patterns and anomalies which facilitates prompt incident detection, emergency response, and effective traffic management (Aksjonov et al., 2018; Gwak et al., 2018). Machine learning algorithms can estimate travel demand and travel times based on historical data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors. These estimates help transportation planners and operators make informed decisions regarding capacity management, resource allocation, and service planning. Machine learning algorithm's efficacy in analysing big data helps to identify trends, patterns, and relationships to support infrastructure planning, transit scheduling, and resource allocation in transportation networks. They also support tasks such as passenger demand forecasting, bus or train schedule optimization, and real-time service adjustments that improve the efficiency, reliability, and quality of public transportation services (Meena et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020a). Hence, machine learning exhibits notable strengths in pattern recognition, adaptability to evolving conditions, and real-time processing within the context of ITS. Nevertheless, it encounters challenges, including computational complexity, reliance on data quality, and interpretability concerns (Sodhro et al., 2019). \n\nDeep learning algorithms, a subset of machine learning that uses multiple layers of operations to extract knowledge and patterns from data, have made significant advancements in ITS. Their ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations from large-scale data has enabled several applications and improvements in ITS. The Deep Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural network (RNN) are some of the common deep learning algorithms found in various applications of ITS. \n\nInitially, perceptron was invented by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943 that performs computations to detect features. However, it performed well only for linearly separable data. The MLP consists of at least three layers of perceptron (input layer, hidden layer, and output layer), as shown in Fig. 9, through which it can handle both linear and non-linear dataset. The MLP is a feed-forward AI algorithm, in which each layer is multiplied by a weight matrix whose weight parameters are learned through back propagation (Halawa et al., 2016). Following the multiplications, a non-linear function is applied at the hidden layer to receive the output. Some of the non-linear functions include RELU, sigmoid and tanh. The MLP serves as a versatile tool in ITS, adept at handling a variety of data types. In the realm of numerical data, MLPs demonstrate proficiency in processing continuous variables such as traffic flow patterns, vehicle speed, and environmental parameters. \n\nMoreover, their applicability extends to categorical data, enabling the analysis of factors like vehicle types or road conditions. In the context of ITS applications, MLPs play a crucial role in predicting traffic flow, detecting anomalies in data for enhanced system security, accurately identifying and classifying vehicles, and forecasting travel times based on historical and real-time data (Frank et al., 2019).

Previous scenarios traffic volume data utilised in these tasks are an essential aspect of ITS research and implementation. However, data loss occurs frequently in the actual world due to a variety of circumstances, which can result in substantial variations in prediction or reduced optimisation accuracy. Imputation is a valid method for dealing with missing values. The MLP \nallows for multivariate imputation while taking into account the temporal and spatial features of traffic volume (Wang et al., 2022). MLP \ncoupled with optimisation heuristics is an effective method for creating a more autonomous and intelligent environment in ITS. Machine learning and an optimisation technique are being used to enable ITS as a smart ecosystem (Frank et al., 2019). MLPs, while versatile and proficient in ITS, face challenges like computational intensity and overfitting, underscoring the importance of data quality and model complexity. \n\nCNN are highly effective in processing visual data, making them integral to various applications within ITS. Particularly adept at handling image and video data, CNNs contribute to tasks like vehicle detection, license plate recognition, and traffic sign identification (Guo et al., 2019). Their proficiency extends to analyzing 3D point clouds and sensor data fusion, enhancing capabilities in tasks such as obstacle detection and mapping for autonomous driving scenarios. Despite their strengths, CNNs come with computational challenges, demanding substantial resources for training and inference (Butt et al., 2021). Their dependence on large labeled datasets and limited interpretability are additional considerations that warrant careful optimization and deployment in the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems. \n\nThe task of Vehicle Licence Plate Recognition has received a lot of attention due to the latest, most effective, and precise Intelligent Transportation System, but it is a difficult process due to variations in perspective, colour, forms and formats, and irregular light exposure conditions at the time of image acquisition. CNN performs this challenging task with efficiency (Pustokhina et al., 2020; Ramasamy et al., \n2023). In addition, CNN enables for reliable traffic flow prediction by taking into account both spatial and temporal variables in a traffic dataset (Guo et al., 2020, 2019). The major challenge in this domain is how to efficiently investigate the spatial and temporal information of traffic data, which is a basic challenge in ITS and has broad implications in transportation management and planning. Considering to the rapid advancements in computer vision, vehicle classification and vehicle detection have a huge potential to transform ITS by improving the effectiveness of automated highway payment and automated traffic monitoring (Butt et al., 2021). Vehicle detection in ITS plays a vital role in ensuring road safety as it is necessary for the monitoring of traffic flow, the identification of illegal vehicle types, the detection of incidents, and the calculation of vehicle speed (Khalifa et al., 2022). CNN \nprovides a significant contribution to vehicle classification and vehicle detection. CNN also makes a substantial contribution to intrusion detection systems (IDSs) by providing practical ways to protect against diverse cyberattacks in various networks, such as the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) network in ITS (Almutlaq et al., 2022). \n\nPredicting pedestrian paths is critical for ITS (Zhou et al., 2021a).

The ability to forecast the intent of vulnerable road users is also crucial to the evolution of both advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). To operate safely and effectively on public roads, autonomous vehicles must comprehend the intentions of other vehicles and change their own behaviour accordingly (Saleh et al., 2017a). LSTM allows ADAS to perform effectively on medium-term forecasts without limiting them to high-probability circumstances like emergency braking. In order to classify driver behaviour, LSTM formulates the task as a time-series classification challenge by modelling the sensor data obtained during practical driving sessions using the smartphone's built-in sensors (Saleh et al., 2017b). Predicting traffic flow, speed, occupancy, travel time, and passenger demand in ITS is an inherently difficult problem due to the highly nonlinear and stochastic nature of complex transportation systems (Kang et al., 2017). Hybrid LSTM variations, such as convolutional LSTM, allow for the capture of both time and spatial information in traffic data, resulting in satisfactory prediction accuracy in the aforementioned ITS tasks (Duan et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2020). The hybrid LSTM autoencoder approach can also detect invasive cyber-attacks such as denial of service, spoofing, sniffing, and replay attacks in central network gateways of self-driving vehicles (Ashraf et al., 2020). \n\nIn RL the algorithm learns a set of actions for a set of internal states and its corresponding actions with a given set of rules and policies by interacting with the environment as shown in Fig. 13. Every action by the algorithm is rewarded by a value. The objective of the algorithm is to maximize the optimal action-value function by obtaining higher rewards through ideal action set. Given a set of state space a set of action space is estimated through the model parameters which are learnt during the model's exposure to the environment. Also, the model has a replay memory that stores the past transitions. The RL algorithms are best suited for sparse datasets and finds a wide range of applications like robot navigation, AI gaming, text generation and so on. In ITS many controls and optimization application are handled by RL. \n\nReinforcement learning exhibits the capability to handle a variety of data categories, including information related to the current state of the transportation system. This encompasses details on traffic conditions, vehicle locations, and the status of traffic signals (Zhang et al., 2020a). \n\nReinforcement learning greatly helps ITS by improving traffic flow and reducing congestion, which is a pervasive issue impacting urban areas around the globe (Liu et al., 2018). RL enables viable real-time actuation mechanisms on a practically relevant scale in ITS. RL coordinates the operation of smart grid (SG) and ITS by providing electric vehicle (EV) owners with a myriad of power and transportation network data for EV charging navigation (Qian et al., 2019). RL aims to minimize the total travel time and the charging cost at EV charging station owing to the randomness of traffic conditions, charging prices and waiting time at EV \ncharging station. The intelligent traffic light control system based on RL \nhelps in the reduction of traffic congestion (Hurtado-Gomez et al., \n2021). RL permits proper traffic state determination, and the reward is key to achieving satisfactory results in traffic light phase scheduling \n(Kumar et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020a). \n\nA large volume of rapidly growing data generated by ITS has become a significant burden on the coordination of heterogeneous transportation networks, resulting in a lack of storage trust between ITS devices and edge servers, leading to in security risks in the data storage process. In ITS, a distributed and reliable storage architecture with reinforcement learning uses an intelligent storage system to dynamically store data with policies based on trustworthiness and popularity, improving resource scheduling and storage space allocation while promoting edge services (Qiao et al., 2020).

Leveraging attention mechanisms, Transformers excel in capturing long-range dependencies within data, proving valuable for tasks like traffic flow prediction, anomaly detection, and sequence-to-sequence applications such as route planning (Liang et al., 2022). \n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) present another powerful tool, featuring a generator and discriminator that work collaboratively to generate synthetic data. In the context of ITS, GANs contribute to image-to-image translation, data augmentation, and the generation of synthetic anomalies for training anomaly detection models (Zhou et al., \n2022). Despite challenges like mode collapse, GANs offer unparalleled capabilities in creating realistic synthetic data, crucial for training models and simulating diverse traffic scenarios. \n\nFederated Learning introduces a decentralized paradigm to machine learning, particularly beneficial for privacy-preserving models in ITS. This approach enables model training across distributed devices without exchanging sensitive data centrally. Federated Learning finds application in collaborative traffic prediction, privacy-preserving model development, and decentralized anomaly detection, allowing for the collective learning from diverse datasets while minimizing the need for centralized data storage (Abdel-Basset et al., 2021). \n\nEach of these advanced deep learning algorithms brings distinct advantages to the ITS landscape. Transformers provide effective parallel processing and sequence understanding, GANs excel in realistic synthetic data generation, and Federated Learning addresses privacy concerns in collaborative learning.

In order to provide a clear picture of the existing applications in ITS, they are categorised and presented in the following sections of this survey. \n\nThe prediction in ITS refers to predicting the traffic state and traffic flow, planning the travel route and scheduling the traffic lights. These applications are useful in the smart navigation system of ITS. This section reviews some of the AI algorithms used in these applications. The traffic related data such as speed, flow, congestion, and travel time are represented as sequence of data with each data corresponding to a particular time instant. This historical data for say 'T' time instants are fed as input for an AI which performs the knowledge mining on the data to predict its future values. The EC algorithm GA along with a set of optimization objectives and integer encoding is used to determine the traffic flow (Li et al., 2016). Under uncertain traffic flows, a multi-agent type-2 fuzzy logic control system with optimize the parameter is used to Differential Evolution (DE) used for a traffic light control system (Bi et al., 2014). Th traffic states are predicted with nominal accuracy using an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) that incorporates a Kalman filter along with it (Lippi et al., 2013). The travel times were estimated and predicted using a hybrid architecture that combined Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) by forecasting multiple period freeway station speeds (Hamad et al., 2009). Forecasting traffic speed is carried out by several machine learning algorithms like SVM (Vanajakshi and Rilett, 2004; Yao et al., 2017) and deep learning algorithms like CNN and DNN (Qiu et al., 2011; Song et al., 2017). The use of computational methods in traffic flow prediction is demonstrated along with other AI algorithms (Antoniou et al., 2013). Another model using GA and fuzzy C-means to cluster traffic state is used to predict the traffic flow using the spatial, temporal and historical features in the traffic flow dataset (Hua-Pu et al., 2015). Deep Belief Network (DBN), a DL algorithm along with Multitask learning (MTL) is efficiently used for supervised traffic flow prediction (Huang et al., 2014). Also, another DL \nalgorithm Stacked Autoencoder (SAE), is trained in a layer wise architecture along with logistic regression for traffic flow prediction (Leelavathi and Sahana Devi, 2016). Certain DL algorithms such as LSTM, RNN \nand GRU that are well-known for sequence data prediction are also utilized for prediction applications of ITS. Short term traffic flow prediction (Fu et al., 2016) and long-term traffic flow prediction (Yu et al., \n2017) are performed using LSTM with the big data collected from the sensors. The RL algorithms are also widely applied to analyse the traffic states to decide the traffic control signal (Gao et al., 2017). A hybrid differential CNN along with LSTM is used to perform spatiotemporal forecasting of traffic flow with consideration to environmental parameters which helps to enhance the model's performance (Li et al., 2017).

A \nvariant of RNN is used to predict the traffic congestion using traffic sensor prediction approach (Toqu´e et al., 2016)The spatio-temporal DL \nalgorithms such as deep spatio-temporal residual network (Zhang et al., \n2018a), Spatial–Temporal Neural Network (ST-NN) (Jindal et al., 2017) \nare also used to predict the congestion by taking into consideration the spatial and temporal correlations in the data. Along with congestion management, travel risk prediction is also an important task in ITS and many AI algorithms are been utilised for it. The well-known ML algorithm multiple logistic regression is used to classify a vehicle related features on road into either risky or safe risk values (Jin et al., 2019). A Random forest algorithm with Bayesian inference is used for crash risk prediction model to reduce crash risks (Shi and Abdel-Aty, 2015). As a result of risk prediction accident prone zones are also estimated using an inception neural network which is a ML algorithm (Ryder and Wortmann, 2017). The driver's aggressive driving behaviour must be warned and following proper driving rules has to be appreciated to avoid serious accidents, overspeed driving and traffic congestions.

In Big data applications algorithms are capable of both recognising the objects as well as locating them. A feature extractor and a classifier are required for the algorithms. The ML classifiers have shown good performance in classifying the traffic sign boards. Some of them include SVM, k-d classifier, and random forest (Greenhalgh and Mirmehdi, 2012; Zaklouta et al., 2011). \n\nWith the advent of DL algorithms, owing to their inbuilt capability of automatic feature extraction, a vast number of DL algorithms show improves performance in the recognition task of ITS. CNN is a DL algorithm which has proved its eminence in the image classification task. CNN and its variants have proved excellence in visual recognition applications of ITS. A simple CNN with multi-stage non-linear transform layers and pooling layers are utilised for traffic sign board recognition (Sermanet and LeCun, 2011). The training time of such a CNN model is improved by introducing a hinge loss stochastic gradient descent (HLSGD) to train the CNN network (Jin et al., 2014). Further, in the CNN \nlayers a spatial transformer layer is proposed to make the recognition process more robust to image rotation, translation and scaling (Haloi, 2015). Moving more advance, a variant of R-CNN is used to tackle the problems of both traffic sign board detection and sign recognition simultaneously by using RGB Space Thresholding to produce candidate regions in the input image (Ren et al., 2015). A hybrid architecture comprising of ANN and extreme learning machine (ELM) is used for effective traffic sign board detector (Sun et al., 2014). DL algorithms also perform efficient in the vehicle detection tasks carried out to detect a required object from an image. This task helps to find stealing of vehicles or presence of another vehicle near an autonomous vehicle. Faster RCNN is a region proposal network which helps in identifying all possible vehicle in a particular region (Ren et al., 2018). The detection accuracy of this model's performance is improved through an additional attention layer and data sources (Zhang and Zhu, 2018). The visual recognition tasks of ITS is also used for identifying lane detection and faults such as cracks in it. The CNN and its variants are widely used for this application which are useful in guiding autonomous vehicles (Maqueda et al., 2018; Ramos et al., 2017).

Planning operations based on the available resources and planning travel route are two important optimization applications in ITS. Optimal choice of travel speed and waiting time are also other tasks under optimization in ITS. A fuzzy logic control system that considers multiple traffic related features is used to solve multiple optimization objectives for optimal path section in ITS (Rilett and Park, 2001). A fuzzy bus holding system is proposed to optimize the waiting time of a passenger in a public transportation system with the help of GPS data (Lo and Chang, 2012). AI algorithms are also used for optimizing the supply of e-bikes and estimating the Time-of-Day intervals in traffic time plans using clustering algorithms (Wong and Woon, 2008). Smart parking system optimization to hold maximum vehicles is performed using GA which is an EC algorithm \n(Pala and Inanc, 2007). Swarm intelligence an EC algorithm along with Mobile crowd sensing techniques is used for route optimization (Distefano et al., 2017).

However, the autonomous driving concentrates particularly on algorithms that help in mitigating congestion, enhance the safety by reducing risks and minimizing travel delay time (Uhlemann, 2015).

A CNN algorithm (Parmar et al., 2019) is used for range finding that could reduce the errors in highway driving of an autonomous vehicle. The AI algorithms are also used for estimating the driver's behavior for calculating their safety. A \nGA based approach is used for classifying a driver driving behavior as either aggressive or non-aggressive (Lopez-Garcia et al., 2015). In autonomous driving, the images from a mono camera fixed on a moving vehicle are used for recognition tasks. The challenges introduce in applying deep learning algorithms on these images for recognition tasks in handled by contextual feature extraction and intraframe data fusion \n(Yuan et al., 2016). An optimal route planning in VANET using the navigation system to find the minimum distance with reduced fuel consumption is also performed using AI algorithms (Chang et al., 2013). \n\nThe big data collected from various sensors of ITS are processed and analyzed using advanced big data platforms which enables parallel computing facilities and distributed file system management for faster data processing. Hadoop is the initial and universal big data processing platform which has distributed processing capability and ability to store huge size datasets. Apache Hadoop is an open-source software and is well suited for ITS applications such as processing GPS and other sensor data. Apache Spark is a latest open-source big data platform which come with the inbuilt capability to perform machine learning based applications Fig. 14. \n\nSpark has the same distributed storage facility as Hadoop and is thus well suited for ITS applications that involve big data analytics. In Spark platform, the Spark core is the core of the system and it performs the management and control processes related to the specific application using the dataset stored in a distributed manner on HBase which is a Hadoop database. Hbase handles high-level feature extraction and effective data retrieval on demand. Critical real-time implementations such as traffic control and management, vehicle speed warning, and risk analysis can be performed on Spark platform. Apart from these general open source bigdata platforms researchers have also proposed several big data platforms for ITS. A data analytics platform which enables software developers and traffic engineers to develop their traffic related applications is proposed using multiple engine (Khazaei et al., 2016). Another big data platform for various data analytics on traffic data is also built using multiple engines (Mian et al., 2014). Similarly, using the multi-cluster approach a theoretical framework, Godzilla, is proposed, to perform traffic data analytics by handling growing big data under growing number of users under different workloads (Shtern et al., 2014). \n\nFurther a virtual transportation data center is proposed using VMware vSphere to handle faster data retrieval and data analytics in ITS (Kamel et al., 2016).

{"doc_id": 87, "text": "In ITS the features extracted from the data for one application is applied for another application. For example, the traffic flow forecasted in the prediction module is used for traffic management applications. Furthermore, with the traffic on process, the traffic data that must be processed for decision making is streaming in nature. Therefore, data streaming process and data injection (transfer of data) are two critical components in the big data frameworks for ITS. A dynamic Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) architecture (Guerreiro et al., 2016b) capable of handling streaming traffic data is developed for dynamic toll charging in highways using Big data platforms such as Spark and MongoDB. \n\nApache Sqoop is used for data injection part in big data process of ITS. Apache Sqoop is used to ingest ITS in traffic management (Zeng, 2015) and vehicle diagnostics applications (Tahmassebpour and Otaghvari, 2016). If the data is unstructured and if the log data in ITS has to be processed for certain applications in ITS then Apache Flume is used for data injection (Ji et al., 2014). \n\nDeveloping big data models for ITS on big data platforms involves a systematic roadmap. The journey begins with a clear definition of project objectives and scope, followed by data collection and preprocessing. As the roadmap progresses through stages of simple \n\nConsidering the surveyed topics in ITS, the various sources of Big Data in ITS, the applications, and different AI algorithms can be systematically categorized, as depicted in Table 1. \n\nAI algorithms have demonstrated exceptional performance in all ITS \napplications, assisting in the improvement of the quality and safety of ITS for smart cities (Voda and Radu, 2019). However, they still have the following challenges associated with their implementation for ITS. \n\nThe future of AI research in ITS is poised for transformative advancements to address current challenges. One prospective trend involves integrating homomorphic encryption with deep learning models, enhancing the security of AI algorithms in smart city transportation \n(Chen et al., 2021). This seeks to fortify data privacy and integrity by maintaining encryption throughout computations. Additionally, the evolution towards Edge AI coupled with quantization techniques emerges as a crucial trend to meet the imperative for lightweight, scalable, and faster inference models. This strategic evolution optimizes models for real-time decision-making in mobile applications and autonomous vehicles, addressing the dynamic demands of an expanding smart transportation ecosystem (Zhuang et al., 2022). Another transformative trend focuses on enhanced reliability through the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), mitigating the black-box \n\nBig data has provided profound achievements in ITS, but there are still significant challenges that, when addressed, can provide better performance in ITS. Some of them are as follows: \n1. **Data Collection:** The traffic data are collected from frequently moving vehicles; vulnerable to data loss and reliability. Advanced automation techniques for data collection needs to be introduced in order to improve the quality of the collected data. \n\nApart from the open-source big data platforms such as Hadoop, Spark and Flink dedicated big data platforms which capable of processing the expanded and complicated traffic data and providing results or decisions in a short period of time are still an open research domain (Assunçao ˜ et al., 2015). \n\nWith recent advancements in AI, big data, and powerful computing resources, the transportation system has rapidly become smarter and more intelligent. In this survey we provided a holistic review of all big data architectures and AI algorithms used in various applications of ITS. For a clear analysis the applications are categorized into four domains namely i) Prediction, ii) Recognition, iii) Optimization and iv) Autonomous vehicles. With a brief introduction to the big data techniques and AI algorithms their applicability on all four application domains is discussed. The literature shows that with improvement in the big data techniques and AI algorithms, the handling and processing for large size data are getting more efficient than the earlier models. Also, the literature shows that out of all AL algorithms, in the recent days ML and DL \nalgorithms are more dominant in producing better results across various application domains of ITS. Based on this analysis and other insights provided on big data and AI, this literature survey serves as a foundation for knowledge in ITS and its application domains. Finally, the survey presents the current challenges and future trends in big data techniques and AI algorithms for ITS applications to benefit researchers who are currently investigating this field. \n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\nAbbasi, M., Rafiee, M., Khosravi, M.R., Jolfaei, A., Menon, V.G., Koushyar, J.M., 2020.

{"doc_id": 99, "text": "Management of sustainable transportation currently is one of the most important aspects of a country's or a region's development from an economic and social point of view considering the net zero requirements The use of electric vehicles (EVs) is recognized as an essential means of achieving global net-zero emission goals. To promote their widespread adoption, the challenges they face must be addressed. These challenges are divided into several categories: infrastructure, adoption, costs, energy transition, awareness, and market-related challenges. Robust regulatory frameworks and incentive policies must be implemented to overcome most of these challenges. For EV adoption to increase rapidly and steadily, such frameworks must include fiscal and non-fiscal incentives that will encourage the masses to convert to EVs. The key findings of the work include identification of several barrier not widely discussed in the literature, emphasizing the need for non-fiscal incentives for EV \nadoption, and presenting a comprehensive analysis of various incentive policies alongside a detailed implementation framework. The implementation framework provides research directions for academics, engineers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders regarding further refinement and enhancement of policy incentives to facilitate the widespread adoption of EVs. \n\nTransportation sector's energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) account for a significant portion of global emissions [1,2]. Internal combustion engines (ICEs) have dominated the transportation sector for decades, but their energy sources depletion coupled with the hazardous emissions has pushed the world to move away from fossil-fuels based transportation sector [3]. To mitigate the hazardous profile of GHG emissions and reduce fossil-fuel based energy consumption, Electric Vehicles (EVs) are being rapidly adopted and with an urgent focus on decarbonizing the transportation sector [4]. \n\nThe adoption of EV holds significant importance for the transportation industry. While certain countries are making commendable strides in the adoption of EVs, others are lagging. EVs have already reached 100,000 in nine countries, and more than 20 countries have exceeded 1 % market share [5]. The realization of a globally emission-free society hinges on widespread EV adoption. To expedite the global transition to EVs and address the disparities in market adoption among countries, it is crucial for policymakers to implement comprehensive strategies. These strategies should encompass incentivizing EV adoption through policy frameworks that include financial incentives, infrastructure development, and regulatory support [6]. \n\nNumerous studies have examined the relationship between EV \nadoption barriers and identified a number of challenges [7–11]. Researchers have identified barriers to EV adoption, but the government must now play a significant role in promoting large-scale adoption of these vehicles. Liu et al. [12] examined the influence of fiscal incentives in the broader adoption of EV. They proposed that the fiscal incentives have a positive effect in the wider adoption of EV however, other policy measures are needed to ensure that EV adoption rate is consistent in the \n* Corresponding author.

Ahmad). \n\nAuthors have conducted a SWOT analysis for the various business models proposed to increase EV adoption and emphasized the use of fiscal incentives to upscale the charging infrastructure. Manousakis et al. \n\nWhile existing literature widely acknowledges the crucial role of charging infrastructure availability, battery capacity enhancement, and financial incentives in influencing EV adoption there is a consensus that more needs to be done to provide comprehensive solutions to overcome these challenges [20–22]. Many studies hints at these factors but fall short of offering detailed strategies for their effective mitigation. It is evident that addressing the challenges of EV adoption requires multifaceted strategies that go beyond simply acknowledging their existence. \n\nTherefore, the novelty of this work lies in the adoption of multifaceted strategies which encompasses the economic, environmental, technical, and business aspects of EV adoption and providing a detailed implementation framework. Table 1 presents a comparative analysis of challenges, solutions, and incentives associated with the adoption of EVs, as scattered across various studies. However, this current study aims to offer a holistic perspective by consolidating and synthesizing the diverse viewpoints on EV adoption. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2211467X24000865-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 100, "text": "The objective of this study is to draw attention to the growing literature on various global policies and regulations. The study aims to evaluate various factors shaping the adoption of EVs while simultaneously highlighting the obstacles and potential advantages associated with this transition. Over the past few years, the widespread adoption of EVs has dominated conversations in the realm of innovation and transportation. Several nations have taken proactive measures to promote this transformative shift, incentivizing consumers through tax reductions and investing in accessible charging infrastructure. However, it's worth noting that not all countries are equally enthusiastic about embracing this innovative concept. Some remain skeptical, expressing reservations about the readiness of EV technology and its potential impact on their economies and existing automotive industries. This dichotomy in global perspectives adds complexity to the ongoing discourse surrounding the future of transportation. To the best of authors knowledge, individual country policy assessment studies have been conducted, however there exist rare studies that have assess policy framework for various countries that will assist in drafting a policy framework for the EV adoption at larger scale. The contribution of this study is as follows. \n\nA well-structured policies and regulations play a pivotal role in the successful adoption and proliferation of EVs [23]. It provides the necessary framework to encourage both consumers and manufacturers to embrace EV technology. Policies that offer incentives such as tax credits, rebates, and access to preferential lanes incentivize consumers to make the switch to EVs [24]. Simultaneously, stringent emissions \n\nClassification of EVs [26,27]. \n\nBattery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) A BEV is a fully electric vehicle that operates entirely on electricity stored in a rechargeable battery. \n\nUnlike internal combustion engines (ICEs), they do not emit any tailpipe emissions. \n\nExamples include the Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf, and Chevrolet Bolt. \n\nPHEVs combine an electric motor and a gasoline or diesel engine. \n\nThey can run on electric power from their batteries for a certain range and then switch to the internal combustion engine. PHEVs can be charged via an electric outlet. \n\nExamples include the Toyota Prius Prime and Ford Escape PHEV. \n\nCharging infrastructure development are crucial for ensuring convenient and accessible charging options, further bolstering the appeal of EVs. In essence, a well-crafted regulatory environment acts as a catalyst for the growth of the EV market, promoting environmental sustainability and reduced reliance on fossil fuels in the transportation sector, aligning with global net-zero objectives [28]. \n\nEVs are essential in the global effort to achieve net-zero carbon emissions [29]. As nations strive to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the transportation sector represents a significant contributor to the problem. EVs, with their zero tailpipe emissions, offer a promising solution. They not only reduce direct carbon emissions but also provide an avenue for integrating renewable energy sources into the grid. By coupling EV adoption with renewable energy generation, one can ensure that the electricity used to charge these vehicles comes from clean sources, further lowering the carbon footprint of transportation. Moreover, as battery technology advances and EVs become more affordable and accessible, they have the potential to replace internal combustion engine vehicles at scale, transforming the automotive industry into a crucial driver of sustainable energy and aid in reaching the vital goal of net-zero emissions [30]. \n\nEstablishing comprehensive regulatory frameworks for EVs poses a substantial obstacle to their widespread adoption [31]. Without clear communication of these policies and regulations to the public, it is highly likely that uptake of EV will be much slower than anticipated. \n\nInadequate drafting of EV-related guidelines could inadvertently give an advantage to traditional vehicles, hindering the uptake of electric ones. The key objectives of the regulatory decision-making identification process involve various steps which includes Problem identification and analysis, Objective setting, Policy formulation, Implementation planning, and Monitoring and review.

{"doc_id": 101, "text": "The development and availability of charging infrastructure play a crucial role in the widespread adoption of EVs [2,10,39]. Charging infrastructure can be classified into several categories, including charging power, accessibility, and charging strategy [40]. Each of these aspects has a significant impact on the convenience and feasibility of using EVs, which, in turn, influences the rate at which EVs are adopted by consumers and businesses. A further description of the various of charging infrastructure is given below. \n\nCharging power refers to the rate at which an electric vehicle's battery can be replenished. It is typically categorized into three main levels: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3/DC fast charging. Level 1 charging is the slowest, using a standard household outlet. Level 2 chargers are faster, can be found in homes, and public charging stations. DC fast charging is the quickest and is regularly available at dedicated charging stations [17]. The availability of higher-power charging options can significantly reduce charging time, making EVs more practical for everyday use. \n\nIncreasing EV adoption requires the availability of charging infrastructure. Public charging stations, appropriately located at places like shopping centres, parking lots, and along highways, make it easier for EV owners to charge their vehicles. Accessible charging stations reduce range anxiety - the fear of running out of battery power before reaching the destination and encourage more people to consider EVs [41]. Home charging options are also important, especially for individuals who have a dedicated parking space, as they can conveniently charge their vehicles overnight. \n\nCharging strategy encompasses a range of factors, such as pricing, interoperability, and smart charging. Pricing can significantly influence the attractiveness of EVs, as lower charging costs compared to gasoline or diesel fuel make EVs more economical. Interoperability is important because it ensures that users can charge their vehicles at different charging networks without needing multiple accounts or access cards. \n\nSmart charging systems can optimize when and how EVs are charged to reduce strain on the grid and lower electricity costs [42]. \n\nThe correlation between charging infrastructure availability and EV \nadoption is well-established. When charging infrastructure is more readily available, people are more likely to consider EVs as a viable option. The expansion of both public and private charging infrastructure, as illustrated in Fig. 2, has had a profound impact on the surge in EV sales globally [34]. However, the installation of charging stations is not without challenges. There are logistical hurdles in terms of identifying suitable locations, obtaining the necessary permits, and ensuring a steady power supply. Moreover, regulatory challenges can vary significantly from one region to another, making it essential to navigate complex legal and administrative processes. Ownership and operation of charging infrastructure is also identified as potential hurdle. Government or private entities might be reluctant to invest in and operate these stations due to concerns about profitability and maintenance costs. \n\nThe charging speed determines how long it takes to recharge a vehicle. EVs charging is usually classified in three level as show in Table 3. \n\nWidespread charging infrastructure addresses many of these challenges and enhances the confidence of EV owners. It eliminates concerns about running out of battery power during daily commutes or long trips. \n\nAdditionally, the availability of charging stations encourages individuals and businesses to transition to EVs, which, in turn, contributes to reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a cleaner environment. Charging infrastructure is the critical driver of EV adoption. As charging infrastructure continues to expand and evolve, it not only addresses practical concerns but also promotes a more sustainable and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. In addition to increasing the charging infrastructure, charging enroute is also proposed in the literature which involves Charging from road, Vehicle 2 Vehicle (V2V), \nCharging trucks and Peer-to-Peer Car Charging (P2C2) with mobile charging stations [44]. \n\nBesides charging infrastructure, there may be other infrastructure challenges, such as the need for upgrades to the electrical grid to handle the increased demand from EVs. EVs have introduced a significant transformative potential within the electricity industry. EVs widespread adoption presents both opportunities and challenges for the electrical grid. On one hand, EVs can serve as a valuable source of demand for electricity, especially when integrated with smart charging infrastructure and renewable energy sources. This can potentially enhance grid stability and utilize excess renewable energy during off-peak hours. \n\nHowever, accommodating the increased electricity demand from EVs, necessitates robust grid upgrades and management solutions. Additionally, optimizing the synergy between EVs and the electricity industry requires careful consideration of factors such as grid resilience, expansion, and policy frameworks to ensure a sustainable and efficient transition to electric transportation [45]. In cases where the upgrade is not feasible, solar-powered charging stations will be beneficial. The use of renewable energy powered off grid charging stations will compensate for any deficiencies that may occur in local electricity networks [46].

{"doc_id": 102, "text": "To achieve carbon neutrality in the transportation sector, battery technologies currently face challenges related to energy density, fast charging, safety, recycling and reuse. As gasoline vehicles are gradually replaced by EVs, the increased demand for batteries presents a significant hurdle in the widespread adoption of EVs [47]. \n\nEVs rely heavily on battery technology, which has seen considerable advancements in recent years. Innovations like Solid-State Batteries, Silicon Anode Batteries, and Lithium Sulphur Batteries have contributed to improvements in the performance and efficiency of EV batteries [48]. \n\nThe following subsection outlines the main characteristics of the latest battery technologies. \n\nTable 3 \n\nOverview of charging topologies.[17,43] \n\nIn addition to the temperature related issue battery raw material availability is also a concern to wider adoption of EVs. Lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and aluminium are key components in most battery chemistries for EVs. Lithium reserves are relatively abundant, but there are concerns about the concentration of reserves in a few countries, primarily in South America. Cobalt and nickel are less abundant and can be subject to supply chain issues and price volatility [52]. Concerns over supply risks of critical metals used in EV batteries are frequently stressed as impediments to the widespread development of EVs [54]. \n\nThe future of energy storage may not be as simple as choosing between silicon anode batteries and solid-state batteries. The global energy market is likely to require a combination of these and other emerging technologies in order to meet its diverse needs such as EVs. Current battery technology has limitations despite substantial advancements. EVs have a lower energy density than ICE vehicles due to a lower energy content of batteries, which affects their driving range. Additionally, charging batteries takes significantly longer than refuelling an ICE vehicle. Hence, improved EV technology such as long range affordable vehicles with alternate materials are needed to increase the energy 3.1.5. *Lack of environmental awareness/limited EV education and training* When consumers lack adequate information about a product, there may be a market failure. Therefore, it is imperative that the correct information be provided to aid the transition to EVs. Environmental unawareness is a major concern that impedes the adoption of EVs. A lack of environmental awareness and limited knowledge hinders the widespread adoption of EVs. The more environmentally aware a consumer is, the greater the likelihood of them choosing a technology or product that is less harmful to the environment. Environmentally conscious consumers prioritize products that have a lower environmental impact, such as EVs [55]. In comparison with ICE, EVs have an environmental benefit due to the absence of tailpipe emissions [8]. \n\nTraditionally, the transportation sector has been only associated with fossil fuels, which is a significant misconception. This misconception arises due to the absence of educational and training opportunities for the general public, as well as for automotive technicians and mechanics [9]. This lack of education can lead to uncertainty and reluctance among consumers who have concerns about EV service and maintenance. Therefore, without adequate education and awareness, achieving mass-scale adoption of EVs remains a challenging task, especially in developing countries [56]. \n\nThe availability of EV models in developing countries may be more limited compared to more developed EV markets. Consumers in these regions may have fewer options to choose from, and some popular models may not be readily available. The rise in gas prices has motivated the public to consider transitioning to EVs. However, the limited model's availability of EVs, along with their higher costs, has made it challenging to make the switch. For instance, there are currently over 400 ICE vehicles available for sale in North America, whereas, there are only a limited number of EV models available [60]. While this is a significant barrier during the early stages of the EV market, this situation will improve once the market is matured and infrastructure is established [61]. Manufacturers in countries where there is a adequate infrastructure for EV charging are building several models EV, providing a wider range of choices for consumers providing the freedom to select from multiple options. However, this issue continues to be a challenge in countries where the EV market is still emerging and undersupplied [62]. 3.1.8. *Purchase price hurdles* \n\nMarket penetration levels for EVs are low in many countries, primarily due to the lack of acceptance by vehicle users.

The Bloomberg New Energy Finance (NEF) report predicts that EVs will make up 35 % of new vehicle sales in 2040. Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) continues to resist this trend and maintains its forecast \n\nTo overcome the negative influence of the oil industry, it is necessary to incentivize the EV and impart transparent and unbiased information to the end users with comprehensive educational and awareness programs to lessen the impact of oil industry on EV adoption. \n\nThe EVs industry is still in its infancy. Poorly designed policies may result in outcomes that are contrary to their original intentions [69]. Incentives are provided to stimuli the adoption of something. While some countries around the world offer generous incentives and subsidies to promote EV adoption, while others are still in the process of developing EV policies or may not have similar incentives in place, which can discourage potential buyers [19]. A classification of the various barriers in EV adoption is presented in Fig. 5. \n\nThe challenges outlined in Fig. 5 must be effectively addressed to overcome the EV adoption barriers. Through detailed literature analysis, it has become apparent that battery capacity enhancement and charging infrastructure are the primary barriers which are closely intertwined and pivotal in addressing other challenges. Once the battery capacities are enhanced with innovative technologies and robust infrastructure is in place, further efforts are needed to decrease the EV cost by providing incentive in various forms. With strong charging infrastructure, high density battery availability and right amount of incentives are available, other challenges such as adoption and awareness challenges can then be addressed within established system. \n\nMounting concerns about air quality and climate change, many countries have taken an active stance to reduce emissions overall from various sectors and transportation sector is one of them. To lessen the emissions from transportation sector, favourable incentives policies and regulations have been implemented globally [70]. Financial and regulatory incentives are essential to the success of all early-stage electric vehicle programmes. However, as the number of EVs increases, financial incentives such as discounted charging, reduced license fees, and subsidies for EV purchase and leasing can become financially unsustainable. \n\nOnce EV adoption moves beyond early adoption, some tools become ineffective, such as allocating road space to EVs. It is difficult to move beyond some of these incentives, particularly in light of the fact that reducing incentives straightaway can undermine market expanding efforts. Thus, many governments have identified their greatest challenge as determining the appropriate incentives for EVs following the initial rollout of these programs [71]. Owing to the EV adoption programmes, EV sales have increased globally, as illustrated in Fig. 6, demonstrating the significant growth potential of this industry. As EVs sales have increased, it is evident that the automotive landscape is undergoing a \n\nThe implementation of incentives and the easing of regulations are among the primary methods for accelerating the adoption of EVs. A \nnumber of government initiatives are being implemented to make EVs more attractive to consumers, including tax incentives, rebates, subsidies, and preferential access to HOV lanes. These initiatives include revising existing policies and introducing new measures. Aside from reducing EV upfront costs, such incentives also make EVs more costcompetitive with traditional vehicles in the long run. \n\nFurthermore, as regulations concerning the emissions of ICE tighten, automakers are increasingly focusing on developing and producing electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift towards stringent emission targets serves as a catalyst for automakers to invest heavily in EV technology and infrastructure. \n\nThe widespread adoption of EVs is largely due to advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure. The advancement of battery chemistry has resulted in longer driving ranges and faster charging times, reducing concerns about the limitations of EVs. The proliferation of charging stations, both public and private, has also boosted consumer confidence in EVs by addressing the issue of range anxiety. \n\nThe rise of the EV market, as depicted in Fig. 7, is not merely a transient trend; it signifies a paradigm shift towards cleaner and more sustainable transportation options. As governments continue to prioritize emissions reduction and as technology continues to improve, the growth of the EV sector is poised to accelerate even further, steering in a new era of mobility that is both environmentally responsible and economically viable.

A detailed policies information in relation to globally leading markets for EV is presented in next section. \n\nNorwegian EV success can be attributed primarily to a comprehensive incentive package that was put in place to promote EVs. Governments and broad coalitions of parties have gradually introduced incentives to accelerate the transition since the early 1990s [53]. Norway has the highest adoption rate of EVs [73]. More than 20 percent of the passage cars (up to seven seats) have already been replaced by EVs, and approximately 80 percent of new cars sold in 2022 were EVs [74]. \n\nThe Norwegian government plans to sell only zero-emission passenger cars in 2025, according to its transportation plan [75]. Norway's EV \nmarket share has increased significantly from 64.5 % in 2021 to 79.3 % in 2022 [76]. \n\nOver 80 percent of Norwegian vehicles are charged at home, which contributes to the success of home charging. Presently, the charging infrastructure is mostly managed by the privately and hence the widespread diffusion of charging infrastructure which is based on the hotspots where the charging infrastructure is needed. The government involvement was also helpful in expanding the charging infrastructure with the launch of Transova (Enova) Project that covered the initial construction cost of more than 1850 charging stations [77]. The Norwegian government offers subsidies to make EVs competitive with ICE \nvehicles on a TCO basis by exempting them from registration tax, value \n\nChina is home to 99 % of all-electric buses used in the world. \n\nShenzhen was the first city in the world to electrify its bus fleet in 2017 entirely [71]. A number of policy initiatives have been introduced by the Chinese government over the years in order to promote EVs [79]. The policy incentives introduced in China after the penetration of the EV market in 2011 have effectively accelerated EV adoption [80]. However, it has become evident that maintaining current policies may not be feasible to accelerate EV adoption on a large scale. Many incentives have been provided, which impose negative externalities on the Chinese government. As a result, the government plans to remove the EV purchase subsidy and the constraint on internal combustion engine (ICE) \nvehicle purchases, encouraging new vehicle owners to opt for EVs exclusively [12]. \n\nCarbon Neutrality Ambitions 2060, and New Energy Vehicle Industry Plan (2021–2035) (NEVIDP) are the latest addition to the existing policy instruments introduced by China. EV policy adoption plans were initiated in 2001 and subsequently New energy vehicles (NEV) and dual credit policy were introduced in 2009 and 2017 respectively [20]. Various Targets, Regulations, Ambitions and targets of China are given in Table 9. \n\nIn the USA, transportation accounts for the largest portion of GHGs emitted, with direct emissions accounting for approximately 16 % of total GHG emissions [81]. EVs adoption has fallen short of expectations despite government support. EV adoption trends, as well as mechanisms that might effectively influence adoption rates, are important for planning and policy purposes [82]. Efforts are underway by the Federal Government to make half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 zero-emission vehicles, as well as to create a convenient and equitable network of 500,000 chargers to make EVs accessible to all Americans for both local and long-distance use [83].

In the updated policy announcement, the UK government has outlined a plan for all new cars to be zero-emission by 2035. A ZEV mandate sets targets for new cars and vans, requiring 80 % of new cars and 70 % of new vans to be zero-emission by 2030, increasing to 100 % by 2035. The mandate provides annual targets, starting with 22 % of new cars in 2024 to be zero-emission, rising to 100 % by 2035.

Transportation has been one of the key sectors targeted for decarbonization efforts following the EU's signing of the 2015 Paris agreement [86]. The EU \nEmission Standard for LDVs is considered a central piece of European road transport regulation. \n\nIn Europe, while incentives played a significant role in driving EV \nadoption, the focus has shifted more towards prioritizing charging infrastructure. While incentives initially attracted more people to adopt EVs, the ongoing concern for European nations now primarily revolves around addressing the challenges related to charging infrastructure, hence incentives are usually targeted for the expansion of the charging infrastructure [89]. Table 12 shows the various regulations, ambitions, proposal, and targets for the Europe. \n\nIndia is the largest market for 2- and 3- wheelers. India aims to transform the transportation sector by 2030 as shown in Fig. 9. \n\nTo increase the use of EVs in India, several policies have been implemented. To encourage the purchase of hybrid and EVs, the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) launched in 2013. There is an efficient and effective electronic mechanism/portal for disbursement of the incentive. The goal of the plan is to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and move the transportation sector to electricity [91]. \n\nAdditionally, the Government of India, initiated the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme to encourage the adoption of EVs by providing a range of incentives and support measures. Phase I of this program was in effect from 2015 to 2019, followed by Phase II, which began in 2019 and was originally planned to conclude in 2022 [91]. \n\nAs part of this initiative, the government has actively released tenders to expand the charging facilities across the country, contributing to the growth of electric mobility. Under the FAME scheme, electric and hybrid vehicle owners are eligible for various incentives, including subsidies for electric scooters and motorcycles ranging from $24 to \n$380, and incentives of up to $1840 lakh for electric cars. \n\nFAME plays an important role in promoting the use of environmentally friendly vehicles and reducing the impact of transportation on the environment.

This entails a significant increase in the availability of charging ports and facilitating the capacity for both businesses and households to install their charging stations. Additionally, careful consideration must be given to enhancing the electrical grid's capabilities to meet the heightened demand resulting from the integration of EVs, particularly during peak load periods. In addition to providing fiscal benefit for the purchase of EV, efforts should be made by the government and private sector to invest in the development of charging stations, ensuring that they are located conveniently and accessible to the public [101]. \n\nTo further promote the transition towards EVs, measures that increase the costs associated with owning and operating internal combustion engine vehicles are crucial. These measures might involve implementing higher registration fees, raising gasoline prices, and imposing taxes specific to ICE vehicles [103]. These actions should be executed progressively and with careful planning, potentially including initiatives like banning the sale of new ICE vehicles or a phased increase in gasoline prices over several years. It is vital to provide support to low-income individuals to ensure they are not disproportionately impacted by these changes, safeguarding their overall well-being during the transition towards an electrified transportation system. \n\nEncouraging businesses to transition their fleets to EVs can have a substantial impact. Governments can offer incentives for fleet electrification, such as lower registration fees, company car tax or exemptions from congestion charges or vehicle excise duty. Businesses, account for significant number of cars on the roads, serve as key candidates for early adoption, holding the potential to catalyze widespread acceptance. EV \nfleets, if embraced, could significantly aid governments in meeting sustainability objectives. This aligns with research focusing on EV \nadoption in personal and household markets, emphasizing the crucial role of financial incentives in driving this transition [104]. \n\nFurther for business adoption EV fleet, additional advantages and incentives can influence them (business and individuals) towards choosing EVs. Exempting EVs from parking fees at public parking facilities or gradually establishing \"green zones\" in congested business areas will not only push for EV adoption for the businesses but for the individuals also. Since, this strategy involves a combination of shortterm perks and a gradual rollout of benefits, encouraging both current ICE vehicle owners and prospective buyers to make the switch to EVs [105]. \n\nHence, in the initial phase to encourage manufacturers, incentives are required in the form of grants, tax benefits, or partnerships for research and development for various EV components. Later, stringent policies measures are needed to change the business model for EV and setting a annual target for EV sales to avoid penalties [107]. \n\nThe increasing adoption of EVs brings with it the potential for grid instability and fluctuations in load when these vehicles are charged using the utility grid [108]. To achieve a comprehensive and sustainable transformation, it becomes imperative to incentivize the use of RE for EVs charging [109]. Such incentives should offer users multiple advantages. For instance, if vehicle charging is conducted using RE sources, additional benefits could be extended to users. These benefits might Fig. 10. Classification of EV adoption strategies. \n\nNon-fiscal incentives refer to initiatives that do not involve the direct provision of monetary benefits to end users. Instead, they aim to encourage the adoption of EVs through various means, such as providing tools and incentives that enhance the appeal of EVs and promote their retention. These incentives encompass a wide range of strategies and benefits designed to make EVs more attractive to consumers [113]. \n\nIn the context of EVs, the application of gamification seeks to enhance the ownership experience by making it more immersive, informative, and rewarding. Simultaneously, it tries to encourage environmentally conscious and efficient driving habits. This approach assists EV users in optimizing the advantages of their electric vehicles and actively participating in the advancement of sustainability [114]. Table 17 describes the various approaches to enhance the EVs owner experience to motivate the use of EVs. \n\nTechnology that is unfamiliar or unproven may be resisted by the consumer. It may therefore be difficult for EV manufacturers and policymakers to identify and address consumer concerns long after technical difficulties have been resolved, which could result in lower acceptance of EVs [115]. Thus, public awareness campaigns are an important part of educating the public on the benefits of electric vehicles. Advertisements, online content, and workshops can be used to address common misconceptions and to provide accurate information regarding electric vehicles, cost savings, and environmental benefits. Developing educational programs to inform potential buyers about the differences between EV models, charging options, and how to maximize the benefits of owning an EV could be accomplished through partnerships with dealerships, online resources, or community outreach programs.

This strategy not only speeds up EV adoption but also fosters innovation and economic growth [117]. Continuous research into battery technology remains crucial for EVs. To sustain progress, the EV industry must address safety, range, and battery challenges. Industry players collaborate to tackle these issues through research, investments, and regulatory support [118]. \n\nHowever, R&D grants specifically provided to EV manufacturers come with strict audit procedures since there is a high risk and prolonged return in EV technology, there is a concern that grants are not directly used for the EV technology enhancement, rather manufacturers divert the funds to general business expansion. Consequently, the primary aim of enhancing EV technology might take a back seat, leading slower progress in technological advancement [69]. \n\nLack of innovative EV ecosystems that offer something new to the consumers, makes EV adoption a challenging task [86,111,119]. An innovative EV ecosystem comprised of innovative business models, manufacturing and delivery, charging infrastructure, and sustainability [120,121]. \n\nBusiness model or strategy refers to the way a business's provides offers goods or services to the consumers. EV buying and leasing are the traditional model of business which are successful to an extent while to increase the EV adoption more innovative business models are needed such as EV sharing and Retrofitting. Vehicle sharing is a popular type of business where people hire automobiles for short periods of time, frequently per hour or day. By enrolling in a car-pooling program and paying a yearly fee, customers are provided with access to a substantial fleet of automobiles. As a result of this approach, users will be able to utilize EVs on a budget. Consequently, it is likely that developing innovative business strategies will provide several approaches to overcome obstacles to extending EV implementation [122]. ICE retrofitting is also an innovative business concept that will address the adoption barrier. Fig. 11 represents the two kinds of business models i.e. traditional model for wider EV adoption while the other shows an innovative approach to increase the EV adoption. \n\nIn terms of charging infrastructure innovation, battery swapping \n\nFig. 11. Ev traditional and innovative adoption models [15]. \n\nIn terms of innovation for manufacturing and delivery, micro factories concept is proposed to reduce the cost of the EVs and make it more cost effective compared to ICEs [124]. Micro factories established near consumer demand centric area reduces the logistics cost, hence the lower EV price and offers flexibility to the consumer to customise their vehicle according to their requirements, will also have an impact on the cost of the EVs [125]. While micro factories cuts down the manufacturing cost of the vehicle, mass customized EVs can also promote the adoption of EVs since each customer can have personalized, this approach boosts the adoption of EV [126]. \n\nFurthermore, sustainability issues surrounding the extraction of rare virgin metals essential for EV battery manufacturing, such as lithium, cobalt, as well as magnets like Neodymium and dysprosium, highlights the importance of their recycling and reutilization [111,127]. Addressing this aspect will significantly aid in reducing the extraction related GHG emissions and make the transportation sector further clean [128]. \n\nHence, a vertically integrated manufacturing facility that produces both EVs, related parts, and also recycle different parts of the EVs such as batteries, can significantly contribute to the adoption of EVs by demonstrating of sustainability. An exceptional example of the vertically integrated EV manufacturing facility is demonstrated by the Tesla and for the same the reasons the consumers have more confidence on Tesla products compared to other manufacturers as shown in Fig. 12. \n\nThe term 'EV' is often closely linked with Tesla above any other car manufacturer because of the innovative nature of the Tesla's business model. \n\nThe rising pressure of reducing the emission from the transportation sector makes the role of well-structured EV adoption policy critical. The transition to the EVs necessitates a comprehensive policy framework to address the multifaceted concerns raised in the literature. A guideline for the policy makers to draft a policy are discussed below. \n\nThe research underscores the intricate interplay of factors influencing the successful integration of EVs into society and policy. Addressing these considerations holistically fosters a deeper understanding of the challenges, opportunities, and strategies required for a sustainable and effective EV transition. \n\nBased on the detailed analysis about the EV adoption policies \n\nThe widespread adoption of EVs is a key solution for a greener environment, given their lower GHG emissions compared to traditional ICE vehicles. However, several obstacles, such as lengthy charging ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2211467X24000865-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 109, "text": "The findings reveal that, unlike many other countries, financial barriers are not a major hindrance to EV adoption in the high-income countries. Instead, there is a need for greater public awareness about climate change and how it can be addressed through sustainable transportation options like EVs. The primary factor discouraging people from purchasing EVs in the high-income countries is the lack of awareness and education. Other potential barriers, such as longer charging times and higher purchase costs, have a moderate impact on people's willingness to adopt EVs, as long as they remain reasonable. \n\nRaising awareness can accelerate EV adoption, particularly if accompanied by substantial government incentives. \n\nGovernment incentives have proven effective in promoting EV \nadoption, as demonstrated by successful cases such as Norway. The adoption of EVs can be significantly boosted by offering non-fiscal incentives such as free parking, cheaper spare parts, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) electricity sales. Furthermore, expanding the charging infrastructure to various locations, including public areas, workplaces, homes, and highways, is essential to persuade more people to transition to EVs. Establishment of dedicated ZEV counter at various public offices and agencies will also positively impact the EV adoption. \n\nHome charging is the most preferred option for the EV owners, and it will be most preferred in the years to come since it provides the flexibility to charge the vehicle at home. Additionally, if space does not allow to have home charging facility, more public chargers in close vicinity to EV users should be the priority for the policy makers. Different countries have different policies of EV uptake based on the geographical characteristics of the region; therefore, each country differ in charging infrastructure deployment. \n\nIn case of home charging, EV users may not always own the property, in that case landlords and owners of the properties, be provided with education and knowledge for the environmental impact of ICE and benefits for the EV so that they are aware of the home charging and allow the tenants to install the EV charger at their premises. One of the reasons for denying the installation of EV charger is about the extra consumption of electricity and misconception if EV is charged from the grid, there will be fluctuation and damage to the appliances. Another issue highlighted in the various research studies is the safety concerns of EV because of the presence of large of amount batteries in the EV which they believe might cause fire. Therefore, a comprehensive educational training which encompasses all the misconceptions about EV usage and charging is provided to property owners. \n\nIn addition to providing guidance to various stakeholder such as Landlords, ICE owners and automobile manufacturers, companies and websites dedicated to answering the most common questions should be established, such as Plug in America [58]. To remove the bias associated with EV, these companies and websites aim to educate, advocate, and conduct research on the benefits of EVs. \n\nMoreover, in order to alleviate the financial constraints faced by prospective EV buyers, it is necessary that banks participate in the widespread adoption of EV vehicles by offering zero markup loans and leases. Regulatory policies should be developed to encourage more banks to offer EV-related financial products. \n\nBuilding on the comparative analysis, this study provides valuable research directions for academics, engineers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders in the field of EVs policy, helping guide future developments in this area. Several key implications for various stakeholders in the context of promoting EVs adoption and addressing climate change are discussed as follows. \n\nAlthough this study has delved into the various aspects of the EV \npolicy formulation, primarily focusing on the adoption of EV, there are some other essential factors in policy framework which are not part of this study. These include factors such as material availability for the EV \nand battery manufacturing, electricity demands imposed by the integration of EV load and recycling and reuse of the EVs, and batteries are the some of the factors that are not consider in this study. With the inclusion of factors mentioned a holistic framework is formulated for decarbonising the transportation ecosystem. \n\nTherefore, future research should be directed towards exploring the ways abundant, easily available and recyclable material can be used for the EV and Batteries. Efforts are underway to develop new battery chemistries that rely on more abundant and environmentally friendly materials to reduce dependence on scarce resources [47]. Efficient management of the grid is extremely crucial research area in the presence of widespread adoption of EVs. Technological developments are needed to reduce the grid load in the presence of EV such as the utilization of Industry 4.0 key enabling technologies with advanced EV \nbattery management system for optimizing the grid load and enhancing energy efficiency [129]. Life cycle assessment and end of life strategies for EV batteries is also a critical aspect which needs further research such as repurposing of the EV batteries, safe disposal of the EV and battery material and resource recovery to make the transportation sector sustainable [130].

These challenges are related to Infrastructure, Awareness, Energy Transition, Cost, and Adoption, providing a comprehensive understanding of the issues and the evolving solutions associated with EV adoption. In addition to a detailed exploration of these challenges and their potential solutions, the study also delves into globally successful incentive strategies. \n\nAccording to recent data, the global EV market (including all types of EVs) is projected to reach a value of $802.81 billion by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.6 %. However, despite this promising growth, 16 % of new vehicle sales worldwide in 2023 were EVs. This highlights the urgent need for policymakers to implement effective strategies to overcome the identified challenges and provide targeted incentives to surmount the obstacles hindering widespread EV adoption, accelerating the transition to a sustainable and emission-free global society. \n\nTherefore, this study has presented key findings to accelerate the adoption of EVs. One of the key findings of this work is to emphasized the importance of innovation in battery technology and infrastructure development to enhance the attractiveness of EVs to consumers. These two factors can contribute to overcoming a couple of major challenges such as range anxiety and availability of charging infrastructure, increasing EV adoptability in the mainstream transportation system. Further, the role of policymakers in creating regulations that incentivize EV adoption plays a crucial role for the EV uptake. By scrutinizing the current state of the art literature on EV adoption and market development incentives, the authors presented several policy recommendations that can be pursued in response to the potential challenges identified. \n\nThe need for policies supporting renewable energy integration and smart grid technologies to accommodate increased electricity demand from EV charging is also highlighted.

We explore the extent to which private automobility will be reconfigured into a private electric automated mobility regime or substituted by a shared electric automated mobility regime that could effectively address societal sustainability challenges. We draw from the multi-level perspective of technological transition, develop a conceptual model outlining possible transition advancements towards private and shared electric automated mobility and review pertinent literature supporting such developments. Our analysis reveals that shared, particularly pooled, mobility emerges slowly (niche level). Key actors resist a shift from private to shared electric automated mobility for economic (vehicle manufacturers), instrumental, affective, symbolic (users and societal groups), tax-revenue, governance and administrative (public authorities) reasons (regime level). The private automobility regime receives only moderate pressure from the socio-technical landscape pertaining to safety, congestion and environmental issues and effectively reacts by electrifying and automating vehicles (landscape level). We conclude that the most likely transition will primarily entail privately-owned electric AVs as opposed to shared (especially pooled) AVs, unless a landscape \"shock\" such as a climate breakdown, energy crisis or a significant political shift towards collective mobility exerts substantial pressure on the regime. Hence, the socioeconomic benefits of the so-called \"three revolutions of automobility\" could be diminished.\n\nShared electric automated vehicles (AVs) are presented as the key solution for the sustainable transition of automobility by the research community, automotive manufacturers, tech industry, consulting firms and public authorities. As Dan Ammann, former CEO of Cruise, an automated vehicle company, subsidiary of General Motors, blog-posted during the COVID-19 pandemic: \"City dwellers, in a sad twist on *social* distancing, are now buying more cars than ever. Traffic won't just come back, it will suck worse than ever. But self-driving cars, which can be shared *safely* and efficiently, will reduce congestion dramatically and permanently. The impact on our cities, our world, and our climate will be real and sooner than you might *think.*\" (Ammann, 2020). Although presented with different acronyms by different actors (e.g., SEAM: Shared, electric, automated, mobility; CASE: Connected, autonomous, shared and electric vehicles; ACES: Autonomous, connected, electric shared vehicles; SAEV: Shared autonomous electric vehicles), the common underlying rhetoric among them is that the environmental and social benefits of AVs do not stem from the deployment of this vehicle technology per se but from the potential of bringing changes to the vehicle operation, vehicle design, transportation system design and choice of fuels (Taiebat and Xu, 2019; Wadud et al., 2016). The term \"shared\" is often used to describe both ondemand vehicles shared simultaneously by multiple riders following flexible schedules and routes (i.e., ride-pooling) and vehicles shared sequentially by one rider, driven to her destination by a personal driver\n(i.e., ride-hailing). In this paper, we differentiate between the two vehicle sharing options using the terms ride-pooling, ride-pooled, or shared (pooled) AVs and ride-hailing, ride-hailed, or shared (solo) AVs when needed.\n\nEvidence suggests that, if AVs are shared (i.e., ride-pooled) and electric (i.e., green-sourced), they are expected to reduce vehicle ownership and congestion, enhance energy efficiency through rightsizing, virtually eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, allow urban space reclaiming through reduced parking needs and enhance social equity for disadvantaged groups (Fulton, 2018; Greenblatt and Saxena, 2015; Kontar et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Milakis et al., 2017; Milakis and Van Wee, 2020; Nikitas et al., 2021; Pan et al., 2021; Rodier et al., 2022; Silva et al., 2022; Zwick et al., 2022).

{"doc_id": 112, "text": "Thus, the question is to what extent the current private automobility regime will be reconfigured into a private electric automated mobility regime or substituted by a shared (particularly pooled) electric automated mobility regime that could effectively respond to key societal sustainability challenges. Despite the rhetoric of various actors supporting the second transition path, there are strong indications in the literature that the first transition path will likely prevail. This position paper draws theoretically from the multi-level perspective of technological transition and develops a conceptual model that describes a transition pathway for the private automobility regime as well as the potential influence dynamics from electrification, automation, and sharing. The model suggests that a transition pathway where electric AVs are mostly privately owned rather than shared will likely emerge, unless a landscape \"shock\" such as a climate breakdown, energy crisis or a significant political shift towards collective mobility exerts substantial pressure on the regime. The paper then reviews the literature pertaining to the various elements of this conceptual model. This includes the niche and structural developments incubating a reconfiguration transition pathway of the private automobility regime through electrification and automation as well as the critical resistance of key actors (i.e., vehicle manufacturers, users and societal groups, public authorities) to a substitution pathway towards a shared electric automated mobility regime.\n\nWe eventually argue, based on the literature review outcomes, that a transition pathway where electric AVs are mostly privately owned rather than shared will likely emerge, significantly limiting the potential synergistic societal benefits of the so-called three revolutions of automobility (electric-shared-automated).\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes our methods, while Section 3 outlines the theoretical background of our study and the conceptual model depicting the assumed transition pathway for the private automobility regime. Section 4 presents the outcomes of the literature review pertaining to the three levels of the conceptual model: niche, regime and landscape. Section 5 provides the discussion and conclusions of our study.\n\nOur methodology involves two steps (see Fig. 1, created with Whimsical Starter). In the first step, we develop a conceptual model based on the multi-level theoretical perspective (Geels, 2002). We argue that the private automobility regime will likely follow a reconfiguration transition pathway (incorporating the symbiotic innovations of electrification and automation), unless a landscape \"shock\" such as a climate breakdown, energy crisis or a significant political shift towards collective mobility exerts substantial pressure on the regime. In this case, a substitution pathway would be possible, leading towards a new shared\n(particularly pooled) automated mobility regime. To develop the conceptual model, we consider the timing (e.g., state of nichedevelopments, landscape pressures on the regime) and nature (e.g.,\nreinforcing or disrupting impact) of the emerging transition of private automobility regime involving vehicle automation, electrification and sharing. We then identify the key pathways (i.e., reconfiguration, substitution) that could represent the timing and nature of the transition towards private and shared electric automated mobility based on Geels'\n\nIn the second step, we review the relevant literature that underpins this conceptual model at each analytical level. Our review starts with key references per topic based on our knowledge of the literature and then we apply backward snowballing (Wohlin, 2014) to further expand the depth and coverage of our analysis. Our review covers predominantly peer-reviewed articles published in Scopus-listed scientific journals, but expands also in grey literature when there is limited published work or evidence in a topic (see e.g., section 4.1). Our analysis does not intend to cover all references per topic, and therefore, a systematic literature review or *meta*-analysis method, such as the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), is not applied. Rather our analysis focuses on the references underpinning the key elements of the conceptual model. According to Van Wee and Banister (2016), a review paper can first propose a conceptual model and then examine the literature underpinning the suggested innovative framework without necessarily covering all references in the field of the paper. Along the same line, Kanger et al. (2020), argue that a systematic literature review of empirical evidence runs the risk of reproducing existing bias, not providing opportunities for theory-driven identification of alternative framings or possibilities implied by existing theoretical frameworks, but not empirically examined yet. These researchers recommend that a two-step approach involving concept formulation and analytical reasoning, followed by theory-guided literature review can alleviate this problem.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S259019822400157X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 113, "text": "At the niche level, we analyse the developments, business landscape and prospects of the shared (pooled) mobility market indicating that it still remains at an emergent stage in the transport market. At the regime level, we analyse key actors' (i.e., vehicle manufacturers, users and societal groups and public authorities) preferences and motivations towards shared (solo and pooled) electric AVs to identify possible resistances against a substitution transition path of the personal to a shared mobility regime. To this end, we identify analytically the key areas of resistance for each actor and explore the literature evidence within each area. At the landscape level, we analyse the type and intensity of pressures to the private automobility regime from different actors. Our analysis comprises public opinion surveys (citizens), policy documents (public authorities), reports and statements of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), indicating that the pressures to the private automobility regime are rather moderate and focused on the safety, congestion and environmental problems of the transport sector, for which the regime already responds with its reconfiguration through vehicle electrification and automation.\n\nThe AVs represent a socio-technical transition of the automobility\n\nGeels and Schot (2007) identify four variations of transition pathways based on the timing (e.g., landscape pressures to a regime in relation to the state of niche-developments) and nature (e.g., reinforcing or disrupting relationships) of the multi-level interactions: transformation, reconfiguration, de-alignment and re-alignment, and technological substitution (Fig. 3). A sequential combination of transition pathways is also possible. The transformation pathway refers to the\n\nNiche innovations by outsiders such as firms, entrepreneurs, and activists remain underdeveloped and thus, unable to induce major regime changes, although their ideas, alternative technologies and practices could be adopted or trigger the regime's reorientation of innovation activities (i.e., symbiotic innovations). The reconfiguration pathway appears when the adopted symbiotic niche innovations subsequently trigger significant changes in the core architecture of the regime (e.g.,\ntechnical, user practices, perceptions; Fig. 3, Graph b). Regime actors remain largely the same, yet competition occurs among innovation and new component suppliers. The de-alignment and re-alignment pathway occurs when the landscape changes are divergent, large, and sudden putting a regime under intense and rapid pressure (Fig. 3, Graph c). The regime destabilises within evolving uncertainty leading to a decline in research and development investments and eventually to erosion and de-alignment. Multiple emergent niche-innovations compete and coevolve until one of them prevails re-aligning and establishing a new sociotechnical regime. If niche-innovations are mature enough at the moment of a regime erosion under substantial landscape pressures, then it breaksthrough, dominates and establishes and new regime following a technological substitution pathway (Fig. 3, Graph d).\n\nIn this paper, we develop a conceptual model (Fig. 4, created with Microsoft Word 2019, licence number: 00414-50000-00000-AA622)\nsuggesting that the private automobility regime follows a reconfiguration transition pathway gradually incorporating symbiotic nicheinnovations (see the 'electrification' and 'automation' arrows in Fig. 4) as add-ons or component replacements (e.g., electric instead of internal combustion engine (ICE) powertrain) responding to moderate, at the moment, landscape pressures (see the 'climate change', 'road safety', 'congestion' dashed arrows in Fig. 4). The model indicates that the incorporation of electrification within the regime precedes that of automation (see the dashed vertical lines separating the two transition phases in Fig. 4), without implying that the transition to electromobility must be fully realised before the automation transition starts. Such transition has been described also in earlier scenario studies including the \"evolution scenario\" by Fraedrich et al. (2015) and the \"Letting go on highways\" and \"Fully automated private luxury\" scenarios by Tillema et al. (2015).", "filename": "1-s2.0-S259019822400157X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 114, "text": "Technical as well as user practice changes are being initiated within the private automobility regime in the process of reconfiguration (see the grey and black circles in the 'Reconfiguration' side of the conceptual model, Fig. 4). Technical changes involve fuel/charging infrastructure, maintenance, service and repair infrastructure, raw materials suppliers, automated vehicle hardware and software technology suppliers including road environment sensing and interpretation, prediction, decision making, and navigation. User practices involve in-vehicle timeuse, travel behaviour, driving regulations and human–machine interaction. The primary actors in the \"reconfigured\" reinforced private automobility regime remain largely the same vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, developing the symbiotic innovations either in-house (e.g., electric powertrains) or by acquiring or developing partnerships with automated technology companies. For example, General Motors acquired Cruise, while Volkswagen and Ford partnered with Argo AI,\nwhich was eventually shut down. Toyota acquired Lyft's self-driving unit, invested in pony.ai and partnered with Aurora, who also acquired the Uber AVs unit, while Volvo, Renault and Nissan partnered with Waymo. Some new players have also been introduced to the reconfigured regime coming from the electric vehicles niche market (e. g., Tesla, NIO), having designed and engineered in-house its own AVs technology.\n\nThe niche innovation of shared mobility services (i.e., on-demand pooled rides involving commercial transaction) developed by public mobility and transportation network companies (e.g., Via, UberPool, Lyft Share rides, GrabShare) does not play a key role to the automobility reconfiguration and therefore, it remains at the niche level (see the\n\"Sharing\" arrow developing only at the niche level during the reconfiguration of the private automobility regime, Fig. 4). Contrary to the niche innovations of electrification and automation, shared mobility services do not improve the regime's (e.g., automotive manufacturers and suppliers) economic performance (in fact, they might yield economic losses), while user practices and established culture and symbolic meanings seem to resist such a transition. Moreover, landscape pressures to the automobility regime such as enhancing social equity, reclaiming urban space, reducing urban sprawl, and enhancing active lifestyles that could be resolved through shared mobility service innovations are considered far milder than congestion, climate change and road safety.\n\nThus, the reconfigured automobility regime tend to pay little attention to niche innovations in shared mobility services developed by outsiders and fringe actors or simply add (or develop in-house) some of these innovations into their portfolio. These services seem to have a complementary role, competing more the traditional public transport services\n(Docherty et al., 2022; Yantao et al., 2021) rather than challenging individual automobility, which lies at the core of the private automobility regime (see e.g., MOIA, a ride-pooling service company, subsidiary of Volkswagen; Chariot, a commuter pooled-ride service company, subsidiary of Ford; and MONET, an on-demand mobility services company, joint venture of Toyota and Softbank). A substitution transition pathway for the automobility regime involving a primary role for sharing mobility services might still be possible in the case of a \"specific shock\",\n\"avalanche change\", or \"disruptive change\" that would exert substantial landscape pressure on the regime (e.g., climate breakdown, severe energy crisis, significant political and ideological shifts in favour of collective over individual mobility; Christiansen, 2020; Klein et al., 2022; Næss and Vogel, 2012; Si et al., 2022). In the 'Substitution' side of our conceptual model, this transition is depicted by the sharing mobility services disrupting the current regime (represented by small diverging arrows) and leading eventually to a new set of regime elements and actor groups supporting these services (represented by the black squares). For example, changes to support sharing mobility services would involve maintenance (e.g., service hubs for shared vehicles), fuel infrastructure\n(e.g., fast-charging electric vehicle stations in high-demand areas), road infrastructure (e.g., priority lanes for shared mobility), vehicle artifact\n(e.g., rightsizing), regulations (e.g., restrictions on private vehicle use),\nand the overall mobility culture (e.g., educational and marketing campaigns). Indeed, such a landscape \"shock\" would provide the window of opportunity and enable sharing mobility services to directly challenge and eventually breakthrough the existing private automobility regime, by influencing both the supply and demand for such services and making them as the most sensible and accessible option for both the mobility providers and people.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S259019822400157X-main.md"}

In this case, a substitution transition pathway would be possible leading towards a new shared electric automated mobility regime (Fig. 4).\n\nIn this section, we examine the relevant literature and evidence at each analytical level (niche, regime, landscape) that underpins this conceptual model. We start our analysis at the niche level describing the weak developments in shared (pooled) mobility (Section 4.1). Then, we focus on the regime level and analyse the areas of resistance of key actors (i.e., vehicle manufacturers, users and societal groups, and public authorities) towards shared automated electric vehicles (Section 4.2).\n\nWe close this section with an analysis at the landscape level presenting evidence on the moderate pressure that private automobility regime receives to transition towards a shared electric automated mobility regime (Section 4.3). 4.1. Niche level: Weak developments in shared (pooled) *mobility* The on-demand ride-pooling market has undergone a significant transition during the last two decades. Despite initiatives by major OEMs and pilots in cities, on-demand ride-pooling remains a niche in the transport market due largely to high operating costs and slow adoption rates. The industry's shift away from early investments in ride-pooling schemes (e.g., Daimler and Ford), underscores the economic challenges and market resistance to shared mobility platforms (Table 1).\n\nFor example, Haarstad et al. (2022) explored the introduction of shared mobility innovations in four cities (i.e., Birmingham, Stavanger, Milton Keynes, and Melbourne) concluding that in none of these cities asset-sharing (e.g., car-sharing) and ride-sharing (demand responsive bus) services are being adopted at a rate that promises significant change to the current individual high-carbon mobility regime. Zwick and Axhausen (2022) note that real world, large-scale ride-pooling services are rare due to high operating costs among other reasons, while Kostorz et al. (2021) suggest that ride-pooling still remains a novelty in the German context, used occasionally and particularly during the evening or the night.\n\nIndeed, major OEMs were the first to enter the market by developing products and educating the market (e.g., Daimler with Via and moovel; Ford with Chariot and Transloc) in an attempt to diversify their business model by acting also as mobility providers rather than solely as car makers (Foljanty, 2022; Fournier and Donada, 2016; Hecking, 2014). However, after heavy investments in multiple ride-pooling schemes (i.e., own and joint ventures, shareholdings) the automotive industry started gradually, by the end of 2010, to withdraw from the ride-pooling market space not realising the anticipated economic benefits.\n\nIn recent years, the ride-pooling market is still in an emerging phase.\n\nFoljanty (2023) provides an overview of the ride-pooling services around the globe. Although, this list might not be complete, it still provides some useful insights. The ride-pooling market is dominated by Business-to-Government (B2G) projects (occurring mainly in USA, Germany, and Japan) where public authorities provide funding for certain pilot period (typically 12 months) to ride-pooling companies to operate small fleets of less than 10 vehicles given that most likely these services are not profitable. Business-to-Consumer (B2C) projects that were initially introduced by the major OEMs tend to disappear, while Business-to-Business (B2B) projects (e.g., university campus shuttles, demand-responsive employee transport services) appear to further grow during 2022 and 2023. Major players in the market, such as Via, further consolidate their position by acquiring smaller companies in the field and diversifying their portfolio of services, thus enhancing their\n\nDespite the industry-wide shift towards electric and automated mobility technologies, manufacturers show significant reluctance to adopt shared mobility models. Three main factors influencing this hesitancy: the potential decline in private vehicle sales, the economic uncertainties of the shared mobility market, and the strategic repositioning required to compete in an evolving automotive landscape (Table 2).\n\nThese challenges show the complex trade-offs that manufacturers must navigate in aligning their businessstrategies with the emerging demands of the mobility sector. Indeed, with a transition from the private vehicle to the shared vehicle business model manufacturers would likely be confronted with market conditions that differ from today's conditions in a number of aspects.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S259019822400157X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 116, "text": "With an increase in shared mobility, vehicle manufacturers are likely to face a decline of vehicle sales in the private segment as (some) households will forgo the purchase of a new car or sell an existing one when start using shared mobility services. There have been several studies supporting this statement both for car-sharing and ride-hailing services. For example, Schmidt (2020) estimated that one free-floating car sharing vehicle reduces new car sales in Germany by three vehicles per year, particularly small, compact and medium-sized car models.\n\nMoreover, Jochem et al. (2020) reported 2.1 to 5.3 sold cars and 7.8 to 18.6 avoided purchases per free-floating car sharing vehicle in the 11 European cities of their survey with more than 10,000 free-floating car sharing users. In the US context, Wang et al. (2021) suggested that regular and active ride-hailing users tend to own fewer vehicles, while Ward et al. (2019) reported a decline of 3 %, on average, in state per capita vehicle registrations associated with the entrance of the ridehailing companies Uber and Lyft for the period between 2005 and 2015. In their subsequent study, for the period between 2011 and 2017, they reported an average increase of 0.7 % in vehicle registration with significant heterogeneity though across urban areas (Ward et al., 2021). Indeed, the possible decline in vehicle sales could be partly compensated by a sales increase (a) in the shared vehicles segment due to the fact that shared vehicles are used much more intensively and, therefore, are replaced more often than private vehicles and (b) in the private vehicles segment through positive marketing effects to the brand image (e.g.,\nmodern, cool, environmentally aware) of vehicle manufacturers being also active in shared mobility services (Czerlinsky et al., 2022).\n\nFurthermore, long-standing market powers could shift. In the event of substantial expansion for shared automated mobility services, commercial clients, such as ride-hailing companies, could change from\n\"friendly competitors\" considered as extra distributional channels for vehicle manufacturers, to \"threatening competitors\" (Beiker and Burgelman, 2020). In this scenario, vehicle manufacturers will not only see a sharp decline in the private segment sales, but they will also lose negotiating leverage with fleet operators because, in contrast to private customers, they buy large numbers of vehicles and place a strong emphasis on cost-related factors, both of which put pressure on vehicle prices. 4.2.2. Users and societal *groups* The literature suggests that people's preference towards shared (solo and pooled) AVs is significantly lower than owned AVs for (a) instrumental (e.g., limited vehicle availability, higher waiting or access time, increased journey time, lower time and cost reliability, higher total cost of ownership and use), (b) affective (e.g., aversion of sharing, privacy and security concerns, self-efficacy concerns, inherent attractiveness of ownership) and (c) symbolic reasons (e.g., socio-economic status, subjective identity, freedom, superiority, proprietorship, individuality, masculinity). In the following paragraphs, we analyse the resistance factors towards shared AVs in each of the three areas, as identified in the relevant literature. 4.2.2.1. Instrumental *factors.* Travel cost (price), comfort, and travel time are key mode choice determinants (Buehler, 2011) including ridepooling in particular (Asgari and Jin, 2020; Greifenstein, 2024; Krueger et al., 2016; Stoiber et al., 2019; Taiebat et al., 2022; Webb et al., 2019). Studies across various contexts and comparative analyses reveal that the direct and indirect costs of shared electric AVs often outweigh those of private AVs ownership, and concerns over increased travel times and decreased comfort further discourage users from transitioning to shared mobility options (Table 3). Thus, the instrumental factors (i.e., travel cost/price, comfort, travel time) represent important barriers to adopting shared mobility services.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S259019822400157X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 117, "text": "Several studies have explored how the instrumental factors will compare between private and shared electric AVs assessing potential modal shifts between them. A first group of studies has focused on the travel cost (price) of future electric automated modes estimating the total cost of ownership comprising fixed (e.g., vehicle purchase, interest, insurance, tax) and variable (e.g., depreciation, maintenance, cleaning, tires, fuel) costs. Bosch ¨ et al. (2018) estimated, for the case of Switzerland, the out-of-pocket cost for private AVs at 0.17 CHF/km\n(0.15 €/km) that is significantly lower than the respective user cost for a mid-size shared taxi (at 0.34 CHF/km or 0.29 €/km). These researchers suggested that private cars would likely represent the most attractive option cost-wise in the AVs era, while shared (solo and pooled) AVs would possibly compete with (automated) line-based mass public transport (0.42 CHF/km or 0.36 €/km), but the level of competition remains unclear given the uncertainty of hidden costs for shared mobility (e.g., cleaning) and the occupancy levels. Expanding the same methodology of cost structure estimation for future modes across 17 global cities, Becker et al. (2020) provided further evidence that the cost of electric automated taxi services will approach this of buses in high income countries attracting a significant share of bus trips. For lowincome countries, no major changes are expected since the cost\n\nA second group of studies expands beyond the travel cost component to include travel time in the total cost of ownership and use of future modes. Travel time (i.e., wait time, access/egress walking time, and invehicle time) appears to be a critical factor for shared (solo and pooled)\nmobility options with its value varying across different geographies and incomes (Greifenstein, 2024; Lazarus et al., 2021). Wadud and Mattioli (2021) incorporated usefulness of travel time to estimate the total cost of ownership and use for every vehicle based on data for the UK context. These researchers concluded that private AVs will likely continue to be the least-cost option in most cases compared to shared (solo and pooled) electric automated vehicle options. Time use and the ownership seem to balance out any potential competitive travel cost benefits of shared automated mobility options against private AVs. Indeed, Moody et al.\n\nPooled AVs were also found to be less attractive than private AVs in a study conducted in Germany (Kolarova et al., 2019). Wadud and Mattioli (2021) suggest that the consideration of psycho-social factors beyond out-of-pocket and time costs would possibly increase the attractiveness of ownership in the AVs era. Below we analyse such resistance factors towards shared AVs. 4.2.2.2. Affective *factors.* Affective factors such as privacy, the comfort of personal space, and the habitual attachment to owning a vehicle prevent users from adopting shared mobility options. Also, concerns over sharing a vehicle with strangers, coupled with the loss of personal control and security, significantly influence the low adoption rates of shared vehicles. Thus, the attractiveness of ownership and the aversion of sharing strongly drive the resistance towards shared electric AVs\n(Table 4).\n\nRegarding the attractiveness of ownership, Zmud et al. (2016) found in their online and face-to-face interview survey in Austin, Texas that most respondents would prefer owning than sharing an AV mainly due to the convenience of vehicle ownership. The respondents indicated that", "filename": "1-s2.0-S259019822400157X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 118, "text": "In the Chinese context, Tian et al. (2021) concluded, based on a stated-choice experiment in the city of Dalian, that people would prefer to own a car, either conventional or automated, than to share one with vehicle availability being among the key motivating factors to own an AV, beyond the operational costs of the different mode options. Similarly, Wang et al. (2021) identified a strong inertia, of the participants in their stated-choice survey in Toronto, to stay with the current conventional private vehicle involving driver assistance systems instead of using shared AVs. Moreover, Clayton et al. (2020) found, based on a stated preference survey in the UK, that a private AV were the most preferred future mode, followed by a ride-hailed AV, a ride-pooled AV\nand an automated bus with the last two options being the least preferred options by a significant margin. Convenience was identified as the most common reason for selecting a private AV. Shared AVs were also reported as the least preferred option, in a questionnaire survey in Dublin\n(Acheampong et al., 2021). The preference for private AVs either as single option or in combination with shared and public transport mobility options was found to be high. Participants in this survey who favoured car ownership and use were more likely to prefer a private AV.\n\nJabbari et al. (2022) found, in their stated-choice experiment in the US, that car ownership has a significant effect on the choice between private and shared automated mobility in the future, suggesting that the higher the psychological attachment to the car the more likely a private AV to be chosen. Indeed, Doody et al. (2021) drawing from qualitative interviews with households in Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK, confirmed that shared mobility habits are rather fragile and less ingrained compared to habits connected to car ownership. Lee et al.\n\nApart from the inherent attractiveness of a private AV, Wadud and Chintakayala (2021) identified also an important inconvenience cost associated with ride-pooled AVs that was attributed to people's aversion of sharing rides. Likewise, aversion of using current ride-pooling services and future ride-pooled AVs, particularly for leisure trips, was reported by Lavieri and Bhat (2019). The main reason was privacy concerns, which could be enhanced by security concerns in the AVs era given the absence of a driver that could take the role of a \"professional guardian\". Security concerns such as the inability to take control or intervene in a shared automated vehicle was also among the factors motivating people to report a preference towards private automated vehicles, according to the results of an online questionnaire survey in Germany (Kolarova et al., 2019). Moreover, about 79 % of the US-based participants in the online questionnaire survey by Wang et al. (2020) responded that they were not willing to share a pooled AV taxi with strangers. Willingness to share AV rides was found to be positively correlated with familiarity of the AV and ride-sharing technology possibly attenuating the risk-perception for this future transport mode. The aversion of sharing rides was reported to remain at a rather high level during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US according to Jabbari and MacKenzie (2020). Respondents in this questionnaire survey reported feeling uncomfortable with sharing a ride with strangers both before and during the pandemic, while in the latter case people appeared more reluctant to share rides to save money or even trying more to use transportation modes that avoid contact with other people compared to their responses before the pandemic. Olaru et al. (2021) explored the willingness to use AVs and peer-to-peer car sharing (i.e., sharing own vehicle in a peer-to-peer car sharing program) in the Australian context finding that about 70 % of the participants were willing to embrace the AV technology, but they were concerned or not seeing the benefit in sharing their own vehicle. Personality traits such as low open mindedness and high conscientiousness together with values focusing on security, tradition, conformity, and benevolence were typical in the group of people resisting the idea of car sharing. Israel and Plaut (2024) suggested that a more nuanced matching of riders based on personal social preferences (e.g., preference to share the trip with women, passengers of a similar age, or non-smokers) could enhance adoption shared AVs.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S259019822400157X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 119, "text": "A higher acceptance rate (61 %) for pooled AVs (i.e., auto-shuttle/\ntrain combination or pooled-use shared AVs) compared to privately owned AVs (39 %) has been reported by Stoiber et al. (2019). According to these researchers this outcome could be attributed to the facts that (a)\nthey did offer the status quo option of the current conventional private vehicle in their stated choice experiment, and (b) Switzerland has already a well-developed public transport system and a nationwide carsharing system in a rather dense urban context. Citizens do, indeed, acknowledge the possible societal benefits of a public transport deployment path of AVs, especially in survey contexts allowing elicitation of their preferences through participatory survey techniques (e.g.,\ncitizen dialogues, in-depth interviews; Chng et al., 2021). Yet, they also acknowledge that this deployment path is the least likely compared to private AVs (Pettigrew, 2021).\n\nUsing a mixed method questionnaire and focus groups approach in Auckland, New Zealand, Mohammadzadeh (2021) concluded that most respondents (63 %) would use private instead of shared AVs for three main reasons. First, car is considered as part of the identity of middleclass New Zealand families. Second, private car ownership is associated with a sense of autonomy and freedom. Third, shared mobility services are considered as complimentary rather than as alternative to private car ownership. Sovacool and Axsen (2018) proposed a set of eight frames for automobility comprising combinations of private and societal with functional and symbolic dimensions. These researchers applied the frames in the case of electrification, automation, and shared mobility. They suggested that the private-symbolic dimensions of automobility associated with car ownership (i.e., expression of gender, identify, class, and wealth) will likely be maintained or strengthened by vehicle electrification and automation and weakened by shared mobility, making the latter mode less likely to be adopted since significant changes to today's car ownership and use practices would be required. Along similar lines, Gauer et al. (2022) found in their study in Canada that privately owned and shared (solo) AVs are more appealing options to the respondents being more car-dependent and considering car as means of their self-identity and status expression. Fraedrich (2021) explored current and future car ownership and use practices through a practice theory approach, focusing not only on individual motives, but also on the socio-technical structures influencing daily practices. Group discussions with people from Germany, revealed that at a first surface-level perspectives for car ownership, use and AVs were rather sceptical. Nevertheless, their underlying orientations remain carfriendly and most importantly ingrained into people's life, thus making any possible change highly unlikely. The analysis revealed that the discussants' private car-orientation is motivated not only by functional\n(e.g., carrying capacity) and affective factors (e.g., freedom, autonomy), but also from symbolic (e.g., status) factors and the firm bundling for car\n\nPublic authorities show caution in the governance and regulation of shared electric AVs. The likely significant losses in transport-related tax revenues, the complex new public and private governance landscape involving new actors at different scales, the challenging and complex changes in the administration required to ensure public value in this transition, the shrinking role of the state globally, and the de facto segregation of the AV deployment from public transport and Mobility as a Service (MaaS) transport are some of the factors slowing down or preventing a transition towards shared AVs (Table 6). And certainly, these challenges and public authorities associated reservations do not reflect a significant shift or a policy \"shock\" in favour of the collective modes.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S259019822400157X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 120, "text": "Vehicle automation, electrification, and shared (particularly pooled)\nmobility services are expected to have a negative impact on public finances through possible losses in transport-related tax revenues (Adler et al., 2019). In particular, shared mobility services could lead to lower car ownership and reduced need for parking translating to less public revenues from sales and property taxes, license plate and registration fees, parking tickets and traffic fines. If a transport-related tax structure is mainly based on property, sales and use taxes then a reduction of the vehicle fleet due to shared mobility could have a significant impact on public revenues. In their study for Buenos Aires, Blas et al. (2020) found that a scenario of a mainly privately-owned electric automated vehicle fleet (70 % owned, 30 % shared vehicles) would result in losses of transport-related tax revenues between 6 % and 17.9 % compared to losses between 25.8 % and 57.4 % for a scenario of a shared mobility services dominance (30 % owned, 70 % shared vehicles). These losses could have an impact on the public investments in transport infrastructure and services, particularly in public transport. They would also require reconsideration of taxes, charges and subsidies distribution among the users of the transport infrastructures (e.g., private cars, public transport, shared mobility services), which is a complex and politically charged problem (Docherty et al., 2018).\n\nIndeed, Docherty et al. (2018) suggest that there is a brief window of opportunity for public authorities to ensure and enhance public value in the smart mobility transition that includes shared mobility services.\n\nHowever, a governance transition in four challenge areas (i.e., short vs long term regulation, taxation, information provision and sharing, equity and inclusion) involving negotiations with a complex network of new actors in different scales, that might pertain asymmetries in power and resources would be necessary. Such governance transitions could also require structural changes in the administration that would involve significant technical, political, legal, and organisation and working culture challenges (Millard, 2013). However, Docherty et al. (2018) conclude that such governance transition is rather unlikely given the goal of state shrinking and administrative costs reduction, shared by most governments globally. Along similar lines, Legacy et al. (2019) suggested that public sector planners in Australia retain a reactionary\n\"wait and watch\" stance due to the difficulties they experience in steering and coordinating AV deployment path within a complex public and private governance landscape. In the US context, planners appear concerned that AVs might result in increased vehicle miles travelled, urban sprawl, reduced public transport use, and lower local revenues (Freemark et al., 2019). Moreover, only few local governments in the US have started planning for AVs. Besides, no connection between AV deployment and public transport or MaaS was identified by Grindsted et al. (2022) who analysed urban plans of 10 European capitals. These researchers conclude that AVs are possible to further promote individualised mobility and intensify the existing automobility regime.\n\nThe actual pressure on the private automobility regime to transition towards shared electric automated mobility remains moderate and focused, according to policy documents and national strategies, mainly on safety, congestion, and environmental concerns (Table 7). Moreover, citizens view these challenges as more critical than other issues such as social equity, enhancing public health and well-being, reclaiming urban spaces, reducing urban sprawl, and encouraging active lifestyles, which could primarily be addressed through shared mobility. The private automobility regime responds to the key pressures with its reconfiguration through vehicle electrification (targeting the environmental\n\nThis triad of key benefits expected from vehicle automation and electrification are clearly reported in policy documents (see e.g., National Science and Technology Council and United States Department of Transportation, 2020), vehicle manufacturers', and OEMs' reports and websites (see e.g., BMW Group, 2021; General Motors, 2022; THALES\nGroup, 2021; Toyota, 2020; Volvo Group, 2022). Additional, more recent, landscape pressures to the automobility regime such as the enhancement of social equity, improvement of public health and wellbeing, reclamation of urban space, reduction of urban sprawl, and promotion of active lifestyles that could be resolved mainly through shared mobility service innovations are considered milder than the", "filename": "1-s2.0-S259019822400157X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 121, "text": "Indeed, the pressure from the citizens to the automobility regime seems to primarily refer to congestion, safety, environment, and travel cost. According to the Eurobarometer survey in 2013 involving 27,680 respondents, the majority of European citizens considered air pollution (81 %), congestion (76 %), travel cost (74 %), and accidents (73 %) as serious problems that the authorities should take action to mitigate\n(European Commission, 2013). In a subsequent Eurobarometer survey in 2019, citizens (27565 participants) responded again, in an open question this time, that congestion (39 %), travel cost (39 %), environmental issues (29 %), and accidents (24 %) are among the most critical issues for daily mobility, while health impacts (15 %) and accessibility (12 %; e.g., for persons with reduced mobility) were ranked much lower (European Commission, 2020b). At the same time, European citizens expect that connected and automated vehicles will primarily reduce accidents (27 %), traffic congestion (25 %) and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption (24 %), while making driving more comfortable (25 %) (European Commission, 2020a). Similarly, the results of citizen dialogues with 945 participants in 15 cities across North America, Europe and Asia showed that road safety improvement was the most frequently reported expectation from AVs (Chng et al., 2021).\n\nFurthermore, national transport policy strategies around the world refer predominantly to the safety, congestion, and environmental protection goals triad. For example, the overarching goals of the US\nDepartment of Transportation for the period 2018–2022 (US DoT, 2018)\nfocus on safety (i.e., reduce transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries), infrastructure (i.e., stimulate economic growth, improve condition and enable efficient and safe mobility), and innovation (i.e.,\nsupport technology transfer and ensure the safety and security of new transport technologies). The Department of Transport in Canada identifies, safety and security, greening and innovation, and efficiency as the three core responsibilities of their plan for 2021–2022 (Transport Canada, 2020). The European transport strategy is centred around the goals of zero-emission, smart (i.e., seamless, safe and efficient connectivity), and resilient (single market, fair and just, safe and secure) mobility (European Commission, 2020c). Finally, New Zealand sets out four strategic priorities in the 10-year land transport plan. These are ensuring safety, providing better travel options that enhance accessibility, developing a low-carbon transport system, and improving freight (New Zealand Government, 2020). However, even these goals are not always translated into policy action denoting a rather mild pressure to existing automobility regime for deep change. Biermann et al. (2022) reviewed 3000 scientific studies on the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (including those directly referring to automobility such as good health and well-being, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities, and communities) and concluded that their normative and institutional integration in terms of legislative action to changing resource allocation is rather limited. These researchers suggest that the political impact of the UN-SDGs is more discursive (i.e., helping to understand and communicate sustainability goals) than transformative.\n\nShared electric AVs are anticipated to bring about a number of positive societal changes (e.g., reducing vehicle ownership and congestion, enhancing energy efficiency, eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, reclaiming urban space, enhance social equity). As a result, the scientific community, automakers, tech sector, consultancy firms, and public authorities frequently present those vehicles as the silver bullet for the sustainable transition of private automobility. Contrarily, evidence indicates that many of the costs of the current automobility regime will likely be maintained or perhaps exacerbated by a shift to electric private AVs.\n\nIn this paper, we explored the extent to which the current private automobility regime will be reconfigured into a private electric automated mobility regime or substituted by a shared electric automated", "filename": "1-s2.0-S259019822400157X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 122, "text": "At the niche level, evidence suggests that shared, particularly pooled, mobility is still at an early emerging phase. Two key developments describe the business developments in the field. First, major OEMs, who were the first to enter the on-demand ride-pooling market more than a decade ago to diversify their business model, have gradually withdrawn from this market. The reasons were the small fleet size of ride-pooling services compared to their mass-market expectations, the delays in integrating vehicle automation that could expand this market, the potential to maintain high private car sales through electric vehicles without compromising their traditional core model and the relative mismatching with public transport authorities, which would be a key ally in this market. Second, current market is dominated by small Business-to-Government (B2G) projects, where ride-pooling companies operate small fleets of less than 10 vehicles on behalf of public authorities for a pilot period (usually 12 months).\n\nAt the regime level, evidence reveals that key actors (i.e., vehicle manufacturers, users and society groups, public authorities) resist a shift from private to shared electric automated mobility for a variety of reasons. For vehicle manufacturers, an increase in shared mobility would mean (a) a reduction in sales of private vehicles as (some) households will forego buying new cars or sell their current ones. These losses may be partially offset by rising sales of shared vehicles, (b) fierce competition, and weak negotiating position with large fleet clients (such as ridehailing services) who prioritise financial rather than sentimental aspects of cars. For users and societal groups, evidence suggest a preference towards private rather shared AVs due to instrumental factors (e.g.,\nlower total cost of ownership and use, higher usefulness of travel time, lower waiting or access time, higher reliability and flexibility), (b) affective factors (i.e., inherent attractiveness of ownership: convenience, vehicle availability, independence, car ownership habit and inertia, private space; aversion of sharing: inconvenience, privacy and security concerns, discomfort), and (c) symbolic factors (i.e., socio-economic status, subjective identity, freedom, superiority, proprietorship, individuality, masculinity). For public authorities, evidence indicates a resistance or lagging in governing a transition towards shared AVs due to (a) likely significant losses in transport-related tax revenues, (b) the complex new public and private governance landscape involving new actors at different scales, (c) the challenging and complex changes in the administration required to ensure public value in this transition, and (d)\nthe shrinking role of the state globally, and the de facto segregation of the AV deployment from public transport and MaaS services.\n\nAt the landscape level, evidence suggests a moderate pressure of the socio-technical landscape to the private automobility regime originating predominantly in the safety, congestion, and environmental problems of the transport sector. The private automobility regime adapts to these constraints by electrifying (which targets the environmental pressure)\nand automating vehicles (which targets the road safety and the congestion pressures). Landscape pressures that could be addressed by a shift towards shared mobility services, such as those that call for the improvement of social equity, public health, reclamation of urban space, reduction of urban sprawl, and the promotion of active lifestyles, are seen as milder and less influential to the regime. A critical landscape-\n\nFuture research could provide insights into the landscape-level\n\"shock\" conditions that may trigger a transition towards a shared electric automated mobility regime and inform anticipatory policies that could prepare for such a transition.

There is an urgent need for countries to create a greener and more efficient infrastructure. Smart infrastructure (SI), as a new type of digitally enhanced infrastructure, has a strong potential to reduce carbon emissions. This study examines the nexus between smart infrastructure and carbon emission intensity (CI) in China, encompassing 251 cities from 2011 to 2019. The findings indicate that: (1) Every 1 % improvement in smart infrastructure reduces carbon emission intensity by 0.2810 %. This effect is significant only in more advantageous geographic locations and non-resource-dependent cities. (2) Panel threshold regression analysis demonstrates a nonlinear relationship between smart infrastructure and carbon intensity, showing a decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend under different energy consumption levels. (3) Mechanism analyses show that smart infrastructure affects carbon intensity through technological innovation and agglomeration effects. (4) Smart infrastructure exerts spatial spillover effects on carbon intensity with substantial spatial decay effects. This paper deepens the understanding of smart infrastructures and provides an empirical basis for the deployment of smart infrastructures to achieve carbon neutrality. \n\nThe concept of SI in existing research has undergone an evolutionary process (as shown in Table A1 in Appendix A). The consensus is that SI refers to digitally enhanced infrastructure incorporating digital elements into the existing physical infrastructure. In particular, the effectiveness of SI applications relies more on advanced technological support, especially disruptive innovation capabilities, rather than solely on the quality of traditional infrastructure development determined mainly by investment scale (Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction, 2019). Therefore, unlocking the potential of SI to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for promoting the realization of The issue of carbon emissions related to infrastructure has garnered attention and requires extensive action. Specifically, infrastructure drives the excessive growth of heavy chemical industries such as cement and steel, which are materials with high carbon intensity. According to statistics, urban infrastructure construction in developing countries may emit 226 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) by 2050, more than four times the current emissions from developed countries' existing infrastructure construction (Bai et al., 2018). Therefore, there is an urgent global need to create new or improved infrastructure to mitigate environmental degradation from increasing energy demands within resource constraints. With the arrival of the digital intelligence era, intelligent technologies such as 5 G, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing offer a sustainable solution for mitigating climate change in Abbreviations: SI, Smart infrastructure; CI, Carbon emission intensity; GDP, Gross domestic product; CO2, Carbon dioxide emissions; IoT, Internet of Things; ICT, \nInformation and communications technology; lnrgdp, The logarithm of the real per capita GDP; gov, Government intervention; lnfor, The logarithm of the amount of foreign capital; edu, Education level; ins, Industrial structure; eco, Economic agglomeration; pop, Population agglomeration; pat, Patent applications; tec, Science and technology spending level; ei, Energy intensity; ec, The total energy consumption; DID, Difference-in-difference; 2SLS, The two-stage least squares. \n\nE-mail address: wuting9919@cug.edu.cn (T.

{"doc_id": 128, "text": "Given that SI is characterized by openness, sharing, and spillover \n(Kjaer et al., 2018), they can enhance energy efficiency and promote a green economy in an organized manner with the support of intelligent technologies (Qi & Shen, 2018). So, can the establishment of SI mitigate carbon emissions in Chinese cities? If so, what are the specific mechanisms that contribute to this impact? Additionally, will this impact show heterogeneity in China? Clarifying these questions will help us better understand the intrinsic relationship between intelligent transformation and carbon emission reduction, particularly recognizing that urban infrastructure can serve as a technological vehicle to achieve carbon neutrality goals. Currently, empirical analyses of SI mainly focus on the system dimension of smart cities (Zhang et al., 2022). However, some scholars suggest that the smart city concept is too broad, and the focus must be narrowed down to specific areas (Song et al., 2023). They have started analyzing the relevant characteristics of SI (Kasznar et al., 2021), including core technology applications (Singh et al., 2020a), resilience (Almaleh, 2023), digital twins (Gürdür Broo et al., 2022), analytics and decision-making (Broo & Schooling, 2020), security and privacy (Kumar et al., 2018), and prospects (Berglund et al., 2020). Additionally, other studies have analyzed the external impacts of SI on cities from an environmental perspective, such as sustainable development (Malagnino et al., 2021), energy efficiency (Khan et al., 2023), and environmental welfare (Hui et al., 2023). However, qualitative methods currently dominate research methodology in studies on SI with fewer quantitative analyses. Furthermore, the nexus between SI and carbon emission intensity (CI) still calls for empirical examination. \n\nTo fill the research gap, this research establishes a comprehensive index system to assess the level of SI based on data collected from 251 Chinese cities from 2011 to 2019, explores the impacts and underlying mechanisms through which SI affects CI based on the theoretical analyses, and tests the spatial effects and geographic decay boundaries of SI \non CI. Accordingly, Fig. 1 presents the overall research flowchart. We chose China as the study object because it is the world's largest carbon emitter and the country with the highest number of smart city projects (Song et al., 2023). By the end of 2017, over 76 % of prefecture-level cities, totaling more than 500 cities, are actively building smart cities, inevitably creating a high demand for intelligent infrastructure transformation (Yao et al., 2020). \n\nThe contributions are as follows: (1) Unlike previous research that predominantly concentrates on the impact of digitalization (digital economy), intelligence (artificial intelligence, smart city), and other overall dimensions on high-quality economic development and ecological environment, this study focuses on the topic of infrastructure digital-intelligent transformation, selects SI as the object of study, and establishes a comprehensive index system at the city level, thus enhancing and enriching the research methodology. (2) This study investigates the impact of SI on CI through empirical analysis from multiple perspectives. We examine the linear relationship between SI and CI, analyze the non-linear characteristics from an energy consumption \n\nThe structure of this study is as follows.

{"doc_id": 129, "text": "SI is a new form of infrastructure that is a derivative of traditional infrastructure (Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction, 2019). By utilizing connectivity and computing, it integrates cutting-edge technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), 5 G, and other advanced information technologies to provide intelligent products and services. Traditional infrastructure mainly refers to physical infrastructure, including buildings, transportation, energy, communication, and waste management (Sun et al., 2022). It not only yields various social and economic benefits like attracting substantial investments, promoting consumption, and stimulating exports (Melo et al., 2013; Cos¸ar & \nDemir, 2016; Sun & Cui, 2018), but also brings positive externalities to the environment through economies of scale and agglomeration effects \n(Chen & Lin, 2021). Among them, the research on environmental effects focuses on the life cycle analysis of transport infrastructure, represented by roads (Hasan et al., 2019), subways, and high-speed trains (Xu et al., \n2022), as well as the assessment of ecological efficiency and carbon footprint impact (Dalkic et al., 2017; Zhou & Zhang, 2022). For example, Jia et al. (2021) highlighted that introducing 100 high-speed trains within an urban area can reduce carbon emissions by roughly 0.14 %. However, traditional infrastructure requires a large amount of materials, such as steel and cement, for its construction, and steel production is known to be energy-intensive and highly polluting (Li et al., 2024a). It is known that the iron and steel industry in China accounts for approximately one-fifth of the total carbon emissions from all energy sources \n(Lin et al., 2023). In addition, traditional infrastructure incurs significant full life-cycle operating costs and often faces equipment depreciation and overheads for maintenance staff. Therefore, traditional infrastructure poses a serious threat to environmental and sustainable development, characterized by challenges such as cropland scarcity \n(Marselis et al., 2017), habitat destruction (Malico et al., 2016), and the urban tropical island effect (Yang et al., 2019). \n\nFrom the above analysis, it is evident that while traditional urban infrastructure has the ability to enhance output levels and production efficiency, this development model primarily focused on economic benefits will inevitably lead to structural contradictions concerning natural resources and ecological conservation. Therefore, technological innovation is urgently needed to transform infrastructure and meet green and sustainable development goals (Sun et al., 2022). \n\nInformation communication and technology (ICT) development is conducive to finding new methods, reducing environmental pollution, and investing in building cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable infrastructure (Lange et al., 2020). As the backend of SI, ICT infrastructure drives the transformation of physical resources into abstract form within the context of the industrial Internet (Mohanty et al., 2016). The common ICT infrastructure mainly includes Internet infrastructure \n(Zhang et al., 2021; Kou & Xu, 2022), telecom infrastructure (Tang et al., \n2021) and broadband infrastructure (Li et al., 2022a). These have been demonstrated to serve as green technology tools. Moreover, with the deepening of digital transformation, the digital infrastructure supported by ICT as the core technology enhances resource allocation efficiency by facilitating the transformation of production methods of enterprises, 1 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transforming-infras tructure-performance-roadmap-to-2030/transforming-infrastructureperformance-roadmap-to-2030\\#annex-a-progress-since-2017.

{"doc_id": 130, "text": "Regarding indicator measurement, scholars use the Broadband China policy as a quasi-natural experiment (Hu et al., 2023; Yu & Hu, 2024), \nand only a few scholars try to construct a comprehensive indicator system to measure digital infrastructure. Regarding impact effects, the potential contribution of digital infrastructure to carbon reduction remains a topic of debate. Scholars contend that, on the one hand, the dematerialization (conversion of physical objects into digital products) \nand substitution (replacement of high-energy production) characteristics make digital infrastructure environmentally friendly and effective in decreasing carbon emissions (Ge et al., 2022). Furthermore, digital infrastructure indirectly reduces carbon emissions primarily by facilitating industrial structural upgrading, enhancing green technological innovation, empowering through digital means, influencing residents' consumption behavior, and fostering public awareness of environmental protection (Tang & Yang, 2023; Liao & Liu, 2024). Finally, a few studies discuss the spatial spillover effects of digital infrastructure based on its networked and shared nature (Hu et al., 2023; Yu & Hu, 2024). For instance, using China's Broadband pilot as a quasi-natural experiment, Du et al. (2023) confirmed the existence of positive spatial spillovers of digital infrastructure beyond geographic and economic boundaries while enhancing carbon emission efficiency. Peng et al. (2024) \nconfirmed that while CI in surrounding areas of pilot cities is significantly affected by China's Broadband Policy, there is no substantial influence on per capita and total carbon emissions. On the other hand, many experts argue that the increase in carbon emissions will directly result from the widespread adoption of digital infrastructure. Firstly, given the energy-intensive nature of digital infrastructure, blockchain technology, data centers, and cloud computing require robust energy-intensive support systems for construction and operation \n(Salahuddin & Alam, 2015). Notably, the transmission, storage, and data analysis within these centers entails substantial power consumption, contributing to an escalation in carbon emissions (Andrae & Edler, 2015). Secondly, digital infrastructure will enhance energy efficiency \n(Wang & Shao, 2024), leading to a substantial rise in residents' consumption of energy-intensive goods, thereby potentially undermining or nullifying the favorable effects of energy efficiency enhancement on conserving energy and reducing emissions (Madlener et al., 2022). \n\nWhen infrastructure demonstrates more incredible innovation in routine operations and can continuously adapt and adjust based on feedback, it is generally considered \"smarter\" (Yin et al., 2015). Compared to the emphasis on applying digital technology in digital infrastructure, SI simultaneously considers both technology and sustainable development requirements (Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction, 2019). Thus, considering the aspect of sustainable urban development, several studies explore the impact effects of subdivided technology areas in SI. For example, Broo and Schooling (2021) argue that data, digital twin technologies, and SI are interconnected and guide climate-aware sustainable decision-making. Singh et al. (2020a) discuss the benefits of deep learning-based IoT \nsmart city infrastructures in terms of increased efficacy and high-performance computing resources. \n\nThrough a review of existing literature, we can see that although it is widely acknowledged that utilizing the latest ICT technology to construct cleaner and more efficient infrastructures can contribute to environmental governance, most studies have focused on analyzing the impact of digital infrastructure on carbon emissions. However, the relationship between SI and carbon emissions has been less discussed. In addition, previous literature tends to select a specific policy pilot as a quasi-natural experiment to measure digital infrastructure. Still, this approach fails to capture the distinct impact differences accurately. Therefore, based on constructing an indicator system for SI, this paper analyzes SI's spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and examines its impact on CI from various perspectives, including linear relationships, threshold effect, mechanisms, and spatial spillover effects. \n\nThe research findings provide insights for formulating policies for urban infrastructure digitization transformation.

{"doc_id": 131, "text": "In addition to possessing the general characteristics of traditional infrastructure such as basicity, publicity, and externality, SI can drive the industry towards a technology-intensive transformation by utilizing intelligent technologies such as Industrial Internet. This transformation can effectively enhance eco-efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. Specifically, this green carbon reduction effect is mainly reflected in how SI improves energy efficiency, promotes resource recycling, facilitates low-carbon transportation, and monitors the environment (see Fig.2). First, based on digital technologies, SI helps to monitor and analyze energy demand and supply energy in a more scientific way, thus optimizing energy management and efficiency. By relying on cloud computing and neural network learning technologies, smart grid systems optimize the power supply chain, improve grid operation efficiency, and reduce carbon emissions (Chen & Lin, 2021). Second, SI can assist policymakers and enterprises in gaining a more precise understanding of resource utilization costs through data collection. This enables them to formulate more refined tax or subsidy policies to motivate enterprises and individuals to better use and recycle resources, and to address the problem of negative externalities. In addition, Esmaeilian et al. (2018) found that infrastructure represented by intelligence and sensors optimizes city waste management systems, enabling waste separation, recycling, and reuse while reducing unnecessary resource consumption. Third, SI effectively promotes low-carbon transport by leveraging its convenience and interconnectivity attributes. Smart transport systems benefit from advances in transportation technology, which help reduce urban congestion and shorten commuting times, thereby lowering vehicle emissions. Additionally, it encourages the use of cleaner modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles and high-speed rail (Zhao et al., 2022). Fourthly, SI enables real-time environmental monitoring through an embedded sensor network, remote sensing technology, and big data for real-time monitoring and accurate management of air quality and carbon emissions, promoting society towards an environmentally friendly and low-carbon model while helping enterprises and residents collect emission data (Du et al., 2023). Consequently, this paper proposes hypothesis 1. \n\nSI exhibits significant potential for carbon reduction and enables economic and social aspects. However, data centers, serving as the cognitive hub of smart cities, are experiencing exponential growth worldwide, with global data volume projected to reach 175ZB by 2025 \n(Zhou, 2021). It is estimated that China's data centers will consume approximately 380 billion kW/h of energy by 2030, resulting in a growth rate of carbon emissions exceeding 300 %. Therefore, as the nature of SI represented by cloud computing and data centers is energy-intensive, it presents a \"consumption increase effect\" driven by demand. On the one hand, SI's construction, operation, and maintenance consume substantial energy, resulting in significant carbon emissions amounting to hundreds of millions of tons (Sun et al., 2022). Conversely, the ongoing growth of SI contributes to improved energy efficiency and streamlines the optimization of energy infrastructure, resulting in decreased energy expenses (Moyer & Hughes, 2012). This cost reduction subsequently stimulates increased investment in and extraction of energy resources (Lange et al., 2020), increasing energy demand and exacerbating negative environmental impacts. Consequently, SI's impact on reducing carbon emissions is nonlinear in various situations. For example, Wu et al. (2021) found that once technology advances to a certain point, the impact of initiatives aimed at conserving energy and reducing emissions from Internet development may be diminished due to a rebound effect. Hence, this paper proposes hypothesis 2. \n\nHypothesis 2. SI has a non-linear effect on CI at varying energy consumption levels. \n\nTechnological innovation effect: By relying on modern advanced technologies, SI can break through innovation barriers between cities, promote effective interaction and convergence of innovation factors and resources, and generate system-wide synergistic innovation effects (Fan et al., 2017). The research has confirmed that the institutional environment and innovation infrastructure influence the level of technological progress in a region by modifying its innovation patterns (Yu & \nZhang, 2015). SI promotes technological progress mainly through the following ways: (1) The development of SI will push cities to have a technologically solid willingness to encourage the continuous updating and upgrading of green and energy-saving technologies through financial support and policy guarantees and to promote low-carbon development through advancements in production processes, new materials development, and fossil energy reduction (Liu & Zhang, 2021). (2) \nInfrastructure consists of channels and nodes with a strong connectivity capability. SI leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to enhance urban interconnectivity, which can better break down information barriers and enhance city interconnectivity. This not only promotes the diffusion of knowledge and technology in core cities but also attracts innovation resources from neighboring cities and enhances the transformation of market innovations (Martin et al., 2016).

Consequently, technological innovation effect can be measured by the proportion of the ratio of science and technology spending to general budget expenditure \n(tec) and the number of patent applications (pat). \n\nAgglomeration effect: The interconnectivity of SI has brought about relatively concentrated economic activities, driving the agglomeration effects (Xu et al., 2022). Puga (2010) pointed out that shared modes, especially shared supporting facilities, are essential for achieving urban agglomeration and promoting increasing benefits for urban clusters. As a compact manifestation of spatial economic behavior, the phenomenon known as the agglomeration effect is accompanied by diverse favorable externalities that contribute positively to the environment (Shao et al., 2019). SI primarily promotes agglomeration effects through the following ways: (1) The digital technology of SI \nprovides efficient transportation methods. Considering the population agglomeration, SI reduces urban commuting distance and transportation costs, although it may lead to a short-term increase in carbon emissions due to traffic congestion. However, extensive research has demonstrated that over the long term, the rapid and efficient transfer and circulation of traditional factors for production, represented by capital and labor, within physical space will engender enhanced social welfare in central urban areas. Moreover, the agglomeration effect resulting from the natural flow of labor will yield a demographic dividend for cities, ultimately leading to a reduction in energy consumption and the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (Liddle, 2014). (2) SI facilitates the increasing concentration of economic activities and promotes the flow of emerging production factors such as knowledge and information data in space, which is conducive to cost saving and improving urban networks and resource utilization efficiency. Glaeser and Kahn (2010) argued that there is a significant negative correlation between economic density and carbon emissions. Economic agglomeration promotes competition and demonstration effects, stimulating regional research and development in green technology thereby mitigating carbon emissions generated during production processes (Yao et al., 2018). However, some scholars pointed out that as spatial agglomeration and economic density increase, elevated energy demand will negatively affect the environment. Only when economic agglomeration reaches a specific scale will the scale effect outweigh the expansionary impact of resource consumption and promote the improvement of energy efficiency, which will be conducive to environmental governance (Xie et al., 2019b). \n\nTherefore, this paper measures the level of agglomeration through population agglomeration (pop) and economic agglomeration (eco). Then, hypothesis 3 and hypothesis 4 are listed as follows: Hypothesis 3. SI influences CI through the effect of technological innovation. Hypothesis 4. SI influences CI through the agglomeration effect (population and economic agglomeration). \n\nThis study aims to investigate the marginal effect of SI on CI. \n\nTherefore, this study uses SI as the critical independent variable and CI \nas the dependent variable. In addition, to assess the influence of SI on CI in Chinese cities, we select a two-way fixed effect model: \nCIit = α0 + α1SIit + a2Xit + μi + δt + εit (1) \nwhere subscripts i and t represent the sample (251 cities in China) and the period (2011–2019), respectively; *CIit* and *SIit* denote carbon emission intensity and smart infrastructure, respectively; *Xit* represents a sequence of control variables in vector form. Specifically, lnrgdp, gov, lnfor, edu, ins are five control variables representing the degree of economic development, fiscal decentralization, opening up, education, and industrial structure. In addition, α1 indicates the marginal impact of SI on CI; thus, α1 is the parameter that we are concerned about most. If α1 is significantly smaller than 0, then the negative relationship proposed in Hypothesis 1 is valid. Moreover, μi denotes city-fixed effect; δt denotes year-fixed effect; εit denotes the random disturbance term. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S221067072400427X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 133, "text": "The essence of the above use of two-way fixed effect model to investigate the direct impact of SI on CI is mean reversion. In fact, the SI's functioning requires electricity consumption, which unavoidably contributes to energy utilization and consequently has a non-linear influence on CI. To examine hypothesis 2, this study utilizes a panel threshold model. The threshold model is a non-linear econometric model that seeks threshold variables, calculates thresholds based on sample data, and examines whether there are significant differences in the parameters of the sample groups divided by these thresholds: \nCIit = φ0 + φ1SIit × I(qit ≤ γ) + φ2SIit × I(qit > γ) + φ*cXit* + μi + εit (2) \nwhere *qit* is the threshold variable and γ represents the threshold value in the regression. I(⋅) is the indicator function, taking the value 0 or 1. If the specified conditions are met, I(⋅) takes the value 1; The single threshold mentioned in Eq. (2) can be expanded to accommodate multiple thresholds. \n\nTo test hypotheses 3 and 4, whether the potential of SI in reducing CI \nthrough technological innovation effect and agglomeration effect respectively, this study adopts Baron and Kenny (1986) to construct a three-step test model that explores the mediating effects. The first step is to examine the relationship between independent variables and dependent variables through Eq. (1); in the second step, Eq. (3) is used to test the relationship between mediating variables and independent variables; in the third step, both the mediator variable and the independent variable are introduced in Eq. (4) to examine how they can simultaneously affect the dependent variable. \n\nMit = β0 + β1SIit + β2Xit + μi + δt + εit (3) \n\nCIit = ρ0 + ρ1SIit + ρ2Mit + ρ3Xit + μi + δt + εit (4) \nwhere *Mit* denotes the mediating variable. The technological innovation effect is measured by two dimensions: the number of patents (including inventions, utility models, and exterior designs) (pat) and the intensity of technology innovation (tec). The agglomeration effect is measured by two dimensions: population agglomeration (pop) and economic agglomeration (eco). Based on the definition of mediating effect, if the β1, ρ2, and ρ1 are significant, and ρ1 is less than of α1 (absolute value) or the significant decreases, a mediating effect will be proved; otherwise, a masking effect will be demonstrated. \n\nExplanatory variable:Smart infrastructure (SI). In a broader sense, SI refers to all complex facilities and software platforms that utilize advanced cutting-edge technologies such as 5 G, IoT, and artificial intelligence to provide cities with efficient interconnectivity and collaboration. Compared to digital infrastructure, SI is considered as digitally enhanced infrastructure. Therefore, establishing digital infrastructure indicators holds significant reference value for SI (Tang & Yang, 2023). \n\nFollowing scientific principles, this study uses five indicator dimensions to measure SI based on the technical attributes and data availability in prefecture-level cities. Following Wang and Shao (2024), we use text processing technology to select the content of intelligent technology areas involved in SI in local government policy texts and construct the interaction term between the frequency of words related to SI and the proportion of value added of the secondary industry to GDP.2 At the same time, considering that the number of employees in information, computer, and software services in each prefecture-level city is closely 2 In order to distinguish it from the scope of digital infrastructure, it focuses on the more powerful data collection, information interconnection and decision-making capabilities of smart infrastructure (SI) using new intelligent technologies such as sensors, Internet of Things and big data, this paper selected six intelligent technology categories as word frequencies: big data, blockchain, artificial intelligence, general-purpose technology, Internet of Things, and cloud computing. \n\nTogether, the above two indicators reflect SI's construction and investment dimensions. In addition, this paper also uses per capita telecom service income, the number of Internet broadband access users, and the number of mobile phone users at the end of the year to assess the cost of facility utilization and coverage (Hu et al., 2023). Table 1 demonstrates the specific indicator names, scores, and attributes. Moreover, to mitigate subjectivity in determining indicator weights and potential bias arising from information overlap between indicators, the entropy method is employed to measure SI (see Appendix B for more details about the entropy method).

{"doc_id": 134, "text": "Explained variable: Carbon emission intensity (CI). CI is defined as urban carbon emissions per unit of GDP. Specifically, urban carbon emissions encompass the portion generated by direct energy consumption, such as gas and liquefied petroleum gas, and the carbon dioxide produced by electricity and heat usage. First, following Wu et al. (2016), we calculate the carbon emissions of each city from electricity, gas, and liquefied petroleum gas. Second, we further compute the carbon emissions from electric energy consumption while determining the carbon emissions from direct and thermal energy consumption based on conversion coefficients provided by IPCC2006. Finally, we combine the CO2 emissions from the consumption of gas, liquefied petroleum gas, electricity, and heat energy in every city to calculate the overall carbon emissions at a city level. \n\nMediator variables: (1) Technological innovation effect. On one hand, innovation outcomes driven by technological progress can be expressed by the number of patent applications (pat), which includes the total number of inventions, utility models, and appearance designs acquired within the present year (Benedetti et al., 2020). On the other hand, the technology innovation intensity (tec) refers to relevant research (Zhao et al., 2023), using the ratio of science and technology spending to general budget expenditure at the local level. (2) Agglomeration effect. Economic agglomeration (eco) and population agglomeration (pop) are selected as measures to assess this effect. Specifically, using geographical concentration (Lin & Tan, 2019), this paper quantifies pop and eco using year-end population and urban employment per unit of land area, respectively. \n\nControl variables: Combined with research on related topics, some control variables are chosen: (1) Economic development level (lnrgdp) is assessed by per capita GDP (Tang & Yang, 2023). (2) The level of government intervention (gov) is assessed by comparing the proportion of general budget fiscal expenditure to general budget fiscal revenue \n(Zhang et al., 2017). (3) The level of opening up (lnfor) is expressed by the logarithm of the amount of foreign capital utilized by a city in that year (Xu & Zhang, 2022). (4) Education level (edu) is denoted by the ratio of students enrolled in regular higher education institutions per 10, 000 individuals (Cheng et al., 2023). (5) Industrial structure (ins) is expressed by the ratio of the contribution of the manufacturing sector to the overall GDP (Li et al., 2022b). \n\nGiven the availability of city-level data, this study focuses on 251 prefecture-level cities in China between 2011 and 2019, resulting in a balanced panel of 2259 observations. The primary data sources include China City Statistical Yearbook, China Energy Statistical Yearbook, China Statistical Yearbook, China Statistical Yearbook for Science and Technology, EPS database, carbon emission accounting database, etc. \n\nGiven the presence of missing values in certain variables, an interpolation technique is employed to enhance their completeness further, and the total indicators, such as per capita GDP, foreign investment, and population are processed in logarithms. The descriptive statistics are presented in Table C1. As can be seen from Table C1, the maximum value of SI is 0.291, and the minimum value is only 0.0222, with a significant difference between the maximum and minimum values, which indicates that there are substantial differences in the development of SI in different cities, and regional heterogeneity analysis is necessary. \n\nMeanwhile, the values of mean (SI) and p50 (SI) are much lower than max (SI), indicating that the current development of SI in most Chinese cities is still in the beginning stage. \n\nThis study adopts the LLC, IPS, and ADF methods for stationarity tests (Yang et al., 2023). The results are shown in Table D3, revealing that all variables are significant under the LLC and ADF tests, but ins do not pass the IPS test; however, all variables after first-order differencing are stationary sequences. This study also tests the long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables using Kao and Pedroni panel cointegration tests respectively, and the results are shown in Table D4. The statistical values of each test are significant, confirming that the long-run relationship analysis is justified. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S221067072400427X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 135, "text": "Cities that have a higher carbon intensity face more significant challenges in reducing emissions and are often more motivated and incentivized to drive the smart transformation, thus facilitating the advancement of SI. In addition, the construction of SI can improve productivity and mitigate resource mismatch by applying advanced technologies, thus reducing resource consumption. To minimize the interference of bidirectional causality, we utilize the proportion of intelligent-technology-related terms in policy texts from local governments, as well as the topographic relief in individual cities as instrumental variables (IV) to capture the extent of SI development and address endogeneity issues, and the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method is employed. On one hand, lower terrain relief facilitates urban infrastructure construction and development, ensuring correlation requirements are met. On the other hand, prefecture-level cities exhibit natural geographical fluctuations with a high degree of randomness, satisfying exogeneity assumptions for instrumental variables. Specifically, 2SLS model is as follows: \nSIit = θ0 + θ1IVit + θ2Xit + μi + δt + εit (5) \nTo acquire more precise regression outcomes, a two-way fixed effect model is selected to examine the average influence of SI on CI that simultaneously controls the city and year. SI's coefficients in columns \n(1) and (2) of Table 2 are significantly negative at a 5 % level before and after the control variables are added, which both confirm that SI can reduce CI, and hypothesis 1 is confirmed. Furthermore, column (2) also indicates that some control variables, including economic development level (lnrgdp), degree of openness (lnfor), and industrial structure (ins), contribute to carbon reduction. The findings of this study confirm a strong positive correlation between high-quality economic development and high-level opening-up. This relationship leads to economic growth and facilitates environmental conservation, promoting green initiatives. \n\nSpecifically, column (2) of Table 2 shows that SI's coefficient is \n− 0.2810, indicating that for every 1 % increase in SI, CI will decrease by 0.2810 %. From a governmental perspective, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has proposed the Three-Year Action Plan for Constructing New Infrastructure for the IoTs (2021–2023), \nwhich aims to accelerate the development of a comprehensive sensing, As depicted in Table 3, in the first stage, IV's coefficient is 21.5793. \n\nAdditionally, under-identification test results indicate rejection of the null hypothesis with a KP-LM statistic value of 101.82. Furthermore, Cragg-Danald F statistic and Kleibergen-Paap Wald rk F statistic are larger than 10, certifying no weak IV concerns. In the second stage, SI's coefficient is − 1.1448, which is significantly negative and proves that the benchmark regression is robust. \n\nIn the above analysis, we solved the endogeneity issues through the IV method. The integration of urban information and optimization of resources in smart city are primarily achieved through cloud computing, IoT, and other advanced generation ICT, which serve as crucial enablers for intelligent infrastructure upgrading. To precisely identify the causal link between SI and the reduction in CI, we adopt a Time-varying difference-in-difference (DID) model and use a \"smart city pilot\" exogenous shock test to ensure robustness in concluding that SI promotes carbon emission reduction (Appendix E shows policy details of the pilot project for the smart city, the Time-varying DID model setting and the parallel trend test). Table 4 verifies the reliability of the empirical conclusions. \n\nThis study employs a threshold model to investigate SI's non-linear characteristics on carbon intensity. Firstly, based on the threshold existence test (see Appendix F for detailed results), both energy use intensity (ei) and total energy consumption (ec) pass the double threshold test. At the same time, they fail to meet the three threshold criteria. This confirms hypothesis 2 regarding the existence of a nonlinear relationship. Column (1) demonstrates that employing ei as the threshold variable reveals a notable suppressive impact of SI on carbon emissions within a reasonably low range of energy intensity (Th≤0.1006).

{"doc_id": 136, "text": "The previous hypotheses, 3 and 4, propose two transmission channels through which SI influences CI. To better assess the channels of technology innovation effect, patent applications (pat) and levels of innovation input (tec) are selected as indicators. When considering patent applications as the mediating variable (M=pat), the findings can be observed in columns (1)-(3) of Table 7. Among them, column (2) \nreveals a significantly positive regression coefficient for pat at a significance level of 5 %, indicating that SI substantially enhances technological innovation level. In conjunction with the findings in column (3), \nit can be observed that patents measured by innovation agglomeration exert a partial mediating effect with a contribution rate to total effect amounting to 10.73 %. When considering the intensity of technology innovation as the mediating variable (M=tec), the findings can be observed in columns (4)-(6) of Table 7. Combining columns (5) and (6), \ntec exhibits a regression coefficient of 3.0957. In contrast, carbon intensity's coefficient decreases from − 0.2810 in baseline regression to − 0.2394, demonstrating a partial mediating effect with a contribution rate to the total effect reaching 14.76 %. All these findings indicate that SI can positively reduce CI by enhancing urban technology innovation levels, thus validating hypothesis 3. Furthermore, the present study quantifies the agglomeration effect through economic and population agglomeration effects. The results in Table 8 demonstrate that population agglomeration plays an intermediary role in the impact of SI on CI, \nwhile economic agglomeration has a masking effect. Columns (2) and \n(3) of Table (8) show that economic agglomeration inhibits the carbonreducing effect of SI and increases carbon emissions, and this masking effect accounts for 4.92 % of the total effect. Column (5) of Table (8) \n\nAn analysis of the factors influencing the pathways found that the technological innovation effect and the population agglomeration effect play an intermediary role in the impact of SI on CI. In contrast, the economic agglomeration effect acts as an inhibitor. Possible reasons for this outcome are: (1) SI enhances city interconnectivity. On the one hand, it promotes the spillover of technological knowledge from core cities, drives technological exchanges with peripheral cities, and thus accelerates the willingness to develop green technologies (Zhang et al., 2023). On the other hand, it facilitates resource and factor flows among innovation subjects, accelerating the conversion rate of innovation outputs through economies of scale and network effects, facilitating optimal allocation of production factors, and promoting technological progress in enterprises (Cheng et al., 2023). (2) Improved infrastructure facilitates regional economic exchanges. Driven by the pursuit of higher profits, populations tend to migrate to areas with higher incomes and more opportunities, thereby generating a population agglomeration effect (Xie et al., 2017). In contrast to previous studies, uncontrolled population agglomeration and imbalance caused by transport infrastructure are detrimental to reducing carbon emissions. SI can optimize spatial patterns more effectively, improve management efficiency, and leverage the positive externalities of population agglomeration (Li et al., \n2024b). (3) Economic agglomeration does not facilitate the SI's carbon reduction process. China's smart infrastructure is still in its infancy, and the economic agglomeration effect it generates is also at an initial stage. \n\nThe initial economic production model relies heavily on high inputs, which mainly results in increased resource consumption, particularly the concentration of energy-consuming manufacturing industries that significantly increase carbon emissions (Lan et al., 2021). Therefore, in the future, controlling the development of economic agglomeration to a reasonable level and promoting the transformation of energy-consuming industries are crucial for promoting agglomeration's carbon emission reduction effect. \n\nThe Hu Huanyong Line is selected in this article to examine whether the location advantages would constrain SI's impact on carbon reduction. This line serves as a dividing point separating cities into southeast and northwest regions based on their economic development level and agglomeration degree. The southeast part of the city is more economically developed, with a higher population density, while the northwest part has relatively lower economic development and a sparse population. The estimations of southeastern cities are shown in columns (1) and \n(2) in Table 9, and SI's coefficients are − 0.3077 and − 0.2443, respectively. This indicates that cities located east of the Hu Huanyong Line enjoy locational advantages, such as talents gathering, which contribute to lower carbon emissions and higher levels of urban innovation.

{"doc_id": 137, "text": "However, columns (3) and (4) demonstrate that SI's coefficients in cities on the northwest part do not exhibit statistical significance, suggesting that these cities have failed to achieve carbon reduction through SI. The main reason may be that the northwest cities are limited by economic resources and market environment, have a weaker ability to gather innovative factors, and are less attractive to talent compared to cities on the southeast part. Additionally, the digital transformation process of industries in cities on the northwest side is more backward, which hinders the layout of SI and the carbon reduction effect of SI. \n\nTable 7 \n\nMediation test 1: Technological innovation effect. \n\nM=pat M=tec \n\nSi − 0.2810** 1.1873** − 0.2508** − 0.2810** 3.0957*** − 0.2394** \n\nPat − 0.0254*** \n\nTec − 0.0134*** \n\nControl variables Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \n\nCity fixed effect Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Time fixed effect Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Obs. 2259 2259 2259 2259 2259 2259 R-squared 0.874 0.918 0.874 0.874 0.864 0.874 \n\nNotes: t-statistics adjusted for robust standard errors are in parentheses; * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. \n\nFig. 3. Schematic diagram of mediation effect. \n\nAccording to the National Sustainable Development Plan for Resourcebased Cities (2013–*2020)*, 251 prefecture-level cities are divided into resource-based cities and non-resource-based cities to explore whether differences in resource endowment will lead to variations in the \n\"ecological friendliness\" of SI. Specifically, resource-dependent cities primarily refer to urban areas that heavily rely on utilizing natural resources, including minerals and forests. It is worth investigating whether excessive reliance on resource-intensive industries hinders these cities from achieving carbon emission reduction through clean energy technologies under the premise of resource advantages. Existing research has analyzed the issue of resource curse under abundant natural resources \n(Sun et al., 2023). Columns (1)-(2) in Table 10 show the carbon reduction effect of SI in non-resource-based cities. However, regarding resource-based cities, SI does not demonstrate an effective reduction in carbon intensity. These results are consistent with the findings of previous studies (Du et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). Several factors can explain this result. Firstly, resource-dependent cities have suffered severe infrastructure deficiencies due to large-scale development and utilization of resources, leading to ecological destruction involving high energy consumption and pollution. Secondly, the resource curse refers to the fact that countries rich in natural resources have experienced slower economic growth, which means that instead of being a \"boon\", \nnatural resources have become a \"curse\" for them. Similarly, due to their relatively single industrial structure, it is difficult for resource-dependent cities to escape the trap of the resource curse as their traditional industries are constrained by path dependence and technological limitations, resulting in slow progress toward intelligence, high-end development, and green transformation. Lastly, cities with non-resource-dependent economies have a more rational industrial structure, which gives them a competitive advantage in digital transformation. 6.3. Assessing the impact of SI on CI in Chinese cities: a spatial analysis 6.3.1. *Characteristic facts from the preliminary investigation* First, we illustrate the spatial distribution and temporal changes of SI \ndevelopment in Chinese cities through Fig. 4. A comparative analysis demonstrates a persistent upward trajectory in the development of SI \nacross Chinese cities, notably highlighted by a significant rise in cities with medium-high and high levels of SI in 2019.4 Meanwhile, a significant discrepancy exists in the progress of SI between the southeast and northwest regions, primarily attributed to the prosperous economy and advancements in high-tech industries within southeastern cities that provide favorable conditions for urban digital-intelligent transformation. 6.3.2. *The analysis of regional boundary of spatial spillover effect* First, existing research confirms that infrastructure exerts a significant influence on local economic activities and also influences neighboring regions due to network externalities (Li & Li, 2013). This phenomenon is referred to as the spatial spillover effect of infrastructure. Second, the spatial spillover effects of air pollution, such as carbon emissions, can be influenced by distance. It has been widely demonstrated that these effects may not exist when spread beyond a certain distance (Liu et al., 2022). Therefore, to explore whether there is a spatial attenuation boundary of SI on CI, this paper is based on Tobler's first law of geography, which states that things within a spatial unit are interconnected. This correlation is influenced by spatial distance. The closer the spatial distance, the stronger the correlation and spatial dependency between things (Tobler, 1970). According to the previous study (Hao et al., 2020), the geographic distance weight matrix and the spatial weight matrix are employed with the thresholds of 250 km, 400 km, 550 km, …, and 2050 km to the variations in spatial spillover of SI \non CI under different geographic distance constraints. Fig. 5 displays changes in the overflow coefficient with geographic location. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S221067072400427X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 138, "text": "The spatial spillover coefficient exhibits a significantly negative trend, indicating that SI has a spatial spillover effect on the CI of neighboring cities. The spillover effect on neighboring cities surpasses the siphoning effect, resulting in a notable decline in their CI. In addition, the overall trend shows an initial rise followed by a subsequent decrease in spatial overflow. Specifically, the curvilinear relationship between the spillover coefficient of SI and the corresponding geographical distance can be divided into three intervals. The first interval is 0–850 km, within which the spatial spillover continues to rise and forms a dense spatial spillover zone. The second interval ranges from 850 km to 1600 km, representing a zone of random fluctuations in spatial spillover. The third interval is above 1600 km, where a clear boundary of decay in space spillover effect occurs at 1600 km. The reasons are primarily as follows: (1) SI reduces market asymmetry and lowers the cost of factor flows between cities, leading to technology spillovers benefiting neighboring regions and reducing regional disparities. (2) Despite benefiting from technological spillovers of the latest ICT, SI faces policy barriers in different locations. Additionally, data transmission costs increase with geographic distance, while the quality of information transmission decreases with geographical distance. Therefore, spatial spillovers as a whole are characterized by distance decay. \n\nExisting infrastructure services globally, especially in emerging economies, pose increasing challenges to public safety and air quality \n(Harrison et al., 2010). Intelligent transformation brings positive externalities to urban infrastructure, which are mainly reflected in the fact that when infrastructure becomes smarter, the resource sharing, efficiency enhancement, and agglomeration effect brought by advanced 4 Based on the calculation results of smart infrastructure comprehensive index, the development level of smart infrastructure (SI) in Fig. 2 can be divided into four levels: low level (SI <0.084), medium-low level (0.084 ≤SI ≤0.135), medium-high level (0.135 <SI <0.212) and high level (SI ≥0.212). \n\nBased on the conclusions, the subsequent suggestions for policy are put forward. \n\nFirst, SI contributes to reducing CI in Chinese cities. Therefore, expanding the coverage of urban SI and lowering the threshold for digital technology usage is essential to directly reduce carbon emissions intensity and leverage green empowerment through SI. This will facilitate deep integration of digitization and greening. On one hand, the government should further augment funding support for SI, encompassing investments in technology research and financial allocations to amplify the scale and efficacy of SI services. On the other hand, we must continuously expedite the deep integration of intelligent technologies with the real economy. \n\nSecond, this study confirms the non-linear trend of SI in urban energy consumption. Cities should prioritize monitoring the energy consumption threshold, particularly when relevant indicators exceed a higher level (ei>0.1006 or ec>=0.1364). The development and operation of SI \ninevitably contribute to increased CI. Therefore, governments and relevant institutions must closely monitor electricity consumption and carbon emissions generated by infrastructure. This requires stimulating the vitality of the urban energy revolution and constructing a comprehensive energy system characterized by clean, low-carbon, and intelligent interconnection. Emphasizing the development of new renewable sources is crucial for driving the transition towards low-carbon energy and the sustainable development of cities. \n\nThird, giving full play to the potential of SI in boosting cities' technological innovation and agglomeration effects and deeply unblocking SI's transmission channels to mitigate CI while avoiding the masking effect. Specifically, it should accelerate the establishment of a sound technological innovation system, promote the rational distribution and orderly flow of population and industry, promote the interconnection of factors and sharing of benefits through the use of SI, and harness the positive externalities of the agglomeration effect to encourage the cities to realize the goal of carbon neutrality effectively. \n\nFourthly, considering the variability of carbon reduction effects in SI \nacross diverse natural conditions and geographical distances, developing countries and governments should avoid a one-size-fits-all policy. \n\nFormulating customized strategies for SI based on their unique characteristics is of utmost importance. Currently, SI can only significantly reduce CI in cities with geographical advantages and those not dependent on resources. Therefore, governments should prioritize the development of SI in these cities, focus on improving the level of intelligent technology application, and take the lead in overcoming core technological challenges in carbon reduction processes. In addition, efforts should be made to accelerate the establishment of urban collaborative innovation mechanisms, remove barriers to factor mobility and policy between city clusters, and improve institutional arrangements for optimizing cross-regional innovation resources.

In China, the implementation of \"smart city pilot projects\" took place in three phases during 2012–2014. Considering the gradual inclusion of pilot cities over time, a Time-varying DID model is utilized to assess the influence of these pilot projects on CI in urban areas: \nCIit = θ0 + θ1smartpostit + θ2Xit + μi + δt + εit (13) \nWhere *CIit* represents carbon intensity of city i in year t, while *smartpostit* indicates whether city i has implemented the smart city pilot policy in year t (coded as 1 if implemented, otherwise 0). μi is city fixed effects, δt is year fixed effects, εit is the random disturbance term, and θ1 corresponds to the difference-in-differences estimator which is of primary interest in this analysis. \n\nSecondly, the adoption of Time-varying DID model relies on the condition that both the pilot city and non-pilot city exhibit a comparable time trend before implementing the \"smart city\" pilot policy, as assumed by the parallel trend assumption. To assess this parallel trend hypothesis, this study employs Jacobson et al. (1992) event study method and specifies the following model: \n\nWhere *Dit* represents a group of dummy variables.

Additionally, Fig. E1 demonstrates that the estimated coefficients during pre-implementation (− 2 and − 1 periods) exhibit fluctuations around zero on the y-axis (represented by a blue solid line), indicating a lack of substantial disparity between pilot and non-pilot cities prior to implementing smart city policies. This observation satisfies the assumption of parallel trends. Moreover, it is noteworthy that significant carbon reduction effects only become evident after the third period of policy implementation, suggesting a certain lag effect associated with this policy.\n\nFig. E1.

In the future, alternatives like battery electric airplanes might be available. Further, vehicles operating in near-vacuum tubes, so-called\n''hyperloop systems'', could represent an alternative. Our first-of-its-kind environmental life cycle assessment\n(LCA), considering its construction, operation, and end-of-life, shows that such a hyperloop system is energyefficient and can exhibit very low greenhouse gas emissions (<8 g CO2\n/pkm) if low-carbon sources provide electricity for its operation and relatively high occupation rates can be realised. The environmental performance of a hyperloop system can be regarded as very similar to that of a train offering the same transport service.\n\nCompared to air travel, environmental burdens can be substantially reduced (<5% impact on climate change compared to conventional aircraft). This fundamental finding holds despite uncertainties regarding technical properties and design choices, which reflect the current development status of the hyperloop.\n\nAirports already reach their capacity limits (Herrera García, **2017;**\nEUROCONTROL, **2018), while exhibiting the highest GHG emissions**\nper passenger-kilometre among available transport options (IEA, **2019;** EEA, **2022). The prospects to decarbonise aviation are not obvious. The**\nbenefits of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) remain to be proven at scale. Biomass-based SAF may compete with other sectors for feedstock and land and lead to direct and indirect land use change-related GHG emissions (Richter et al., **2018). Synthetic (electricity-based) SAF only**\nprovides climate benefits when produced with low-carbon electricity (Ueckerdt et al., 2021). Scaling up production will be challenging (Odenweller et al., **2022) and high demand for such electricity**\nmakes them economically and resource-wise questionable (Ueckerdt et al., **2021). Lastly, while non-CO**2 climate forcers associated with aviation (primarily contrails and emissions of NOx) (Lee et al., **2021)** would be partially mitigated by the use of SAF (Burkhardt et al.,\n2018; Voigt et al., 2021; Bier and Burkhardt, **2022) - via reduced** NOx and soot particles emissions - those may still represent up to half of the warming caused by the European fleet by 2100, according to Sacchi et al. **(2023). Other technological advancements may reduce**\naviation's contribution to global warming, such as fuel cell and battery electric aircraft. However, Miller et al. **(2023) have shown that fuel**\nAn increasing population and industrial activity in a globalised economy have led to an ever-higher demand for the transport of freight and passengers over increasing distances (Schafer and Victor, **1998).**\nThe transport sector accounted for over 27% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in 2019 (IEA, **2021) and these continue to rise rapidly,** mainly due to the rapid growth of air travel. For this reason, there is an urgent need for low-carbon, high-quality public transport systems that help reduce emissions while accommodating the need for long-distance transport.\n\nResearch article\n\nFast as a plane, clean as a train? Prospective life cycle assessment of a hyperloop system cell electric aircraft offer limited GHG reduction benefits unless the hydrogen is produced using biomass followed by carbon capture and storage (a technological route that has yet to emerge). Renewable-based hydrogen could reduce GHG emissions by 67% relative to an aircraft powered with conventional kerosene. Nevertheless, this reduction is insufficient to bring GHG emissions near the level of the system under study. Regarding the battery-electric option, the authors could not find any LCA studies for commercial aircraft. However, the development of battery-electric options relies on significant progress in battery energy density that is yet to be realised: Scholz et al. **(2022) estimate a**\nminimum requirement of 1000 Wh/kg of battery cell (compared to the current approximately 300 Wh) for an aircraft to cover short-haul operations.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S266691612400015X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 142, "text": "This study presents a potential alternative for long-distance transport with limited GHG emissions: vacuum transport, often referred to as ''hyperloop''. Hyperloop systems carry passengers and cargo above or below ground through low-pressure tubes, achieving a greater energy efficiency than trains through reduced friction and drag, thereby providing a means for high-speed transport with lower energy consumption.\n\nTo help reach climate neutrality within the transport sector (IPCC,\n2022), the least GHG-emitting means of transport must be deployed quickly. Life cycle assessment (LCA), a method to quantify environmental burdens of a product system throughout its relevant life cycle stages (Hauschild et al., 2018), is well suited to assess the environmental performance of different means of transport (Schäfer and Yeh, **2020;**\nSacchi et al., 2022a; Borken-Kleefeld et al., **2013). This study presents** the first LCA of a hyperloop system, quantifying multiple environmental indicators besides GHG emissions compared to existing solutions for long-distance passenger transport, i.e. trains and intra-EU aircraft, all with entry into service in 2040. This study gives insights as to whether vacuum transport can play a role in the ongoing decarbonisation efforts of transport.\n\nHence, the main research question to be answered by this analysis is the following: What is the environmental performance - in terms of impacts on climate change and other environmental burdens relevant for mobility technologies - of a future hyperloop transport system from a life-cycle perspective, compared to alternative passenger transport options like high-speed trains and aircraft?\n\nA vast body of literature quantifying the environmental performance of passenger transport vehicles, modes and systems, most often focusing on climate impacts, using environmental LCA (Hellweg et al.,\n2023) exists: from (human-powered) micro-mobility (Oeschger et al., 2020; Brand, 2021) to motorised private transport (Sacchi et al., **2022a;** Knobloch et al., 2020; Miotti et al., **2017), public transport on road**\nand railways (Jiang et al., 2021; Soukhov and Mohamed, 2022; **Rupp**\net al., 2019; Kortazar et al., 2021; Jakub et al., 2022), to aviation (Rupcic et al., 2023; Sacchi et al., **2023). Also, shared mobility concepts**\nand their environmental performance have been addressed (Narayanan et al., **2020) as well as specific sub-components of transport systems**\nsuch as roads (Jiang and Wu, **2019). Common findings include the** fact that, if low-carbon electricity can be used, electrified transport options exhibit lower climate impacts than their petroleum-based counterparts (Sacchi et al., 2022a; Knobloch et al., 2020; Miotti et al., **2017;**\nRupp et al., 2019; Jakub et al., **2022) and that occupation rates are often among the key factors determining environmental performances of**\ntransport options (Borken-Kleefeld et al., 2013; **Soukhov and Mohamed,**\n2022; Schaefer and Yeh, **2020).**\nWhen it comes to the evaluation of environmental impacts of high-speed, ground-based (or underground) transport systems, peerreviewed studies are much more scarce, even though the number of published papers addressing specific aspects of hyperloop transport systems has risen considerably in recent years (Gkoumas, **2021;**\nMitropoulos et al., **2021), as briefly summarised in the following.**\n \nIn a multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) from Janić **(2018),**\nhigh-speed trains, Transrapid Maglev (magnetic levitation) and hyperloop systems for passengers between Moscow and St. Petersburg were examined with the result that hyperloop shows the best environmental and economic performance, whereby only the energy consumption and related GHG emissions in the use phase were considered.\n\nFurther analysis in terms of energy demand and emissions was carried out by Hirde et al. **(2022) who examined the possible routes**\nMumbai–Pune, Dubai–Abu Dhabi and Chicago–Pittsburgh and concluded that the hyperloop system is 40% more energy-efficient than an aircraft per passenger kilometre for the Indian route, but three times more energy-intensive than the E5 Bullet Train and the Transrapid Maglev.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S266691612400015X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 143, "text": "Furthermore, there is an analysis by Janić **(2021) of the direct**\nemissions and energy consumption of high-speed trains, Maglev trains, hyperloops and aircraft for passenger transport. There, it was shown that Maglev and hyperloop can achieve the most promising results under certain circumstances, such as higher distance and capacity. Still, it is also pointed out that the scope needs to be extended to an LCA for more robust results.\n\nWhile existing studies have explored aspects of hyperloop systems' energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, a comprehensive, transparent environmental LCA has not yet been performed. First, the scope of these studies is limited to the operation phase, omitting the systems supporting the life cycle of a hyperloop system (e.g., electricity, steel, concrete, end-of-life treatments) that LCA considers. Second, the existing analyses assume the hyperloop to be designed like envisioned by Musk **(2013) (28 passengers/pod, 1220 km/h), while developers**\nactually developing hyperloop systems today envision larger vehicles and lower speeds (700–900 km/h). Third, the prospective nature of such analysis is preponderant as hyperloop systems will operate within conditions that are likely very different from today's. The prospective LCA framework used here considers the expected changes in the provision of products and services necessary to the life cycle of a hyperloop system, most notably the supply of electricity, steel, cement and fuel in Switzerland and Europe. Fourth, considering the promotion of a specific means of transport based on low GHG emissions and energy consumption, it is essential to weigh these advantages against potential trade-offs regarding other environmental indicators presented for the first time in this study.\n\nBased on the guiding principles defined in ISO 14040/44 (ISO,\n2006a,b; Hellweg et al., **2023), LCA allows to systematically account**\nfor and characterise harmful emissions occurring during each of the relevant phases of the life cycle of a product or service, from its conception, through its production, use and down to its disposal. Such scope is referred to as cradle-to-grave.\n\nThe main purpose of this LCA is to determine the environmental impact of the hyperloop passenger transport service over its entire life cycle. The evaluated system is assumed to be set in Switzerland (Pareschi et al., **2023); thus, the production, use and end-of-life**\n(EOL) phases are all modelled as taking place in Switzerland.\n\nThe time frame is set between 2040 and 2065, representing the approximate expected lifespan of hyperloop vehicles.\n\nSince no datasets on hyperloop or Maglev systems are currently available in life cycle inventory (LCI) databases, the complete hyperloop system is first designed and translated into a detailed LCI. Given the large variety of proposed hyperloop solutions, a broad sensitivity analysis is then carried out to determine the impact of various design choices on the overall energy consumption. In particular, different operational and acceleration strategies are tested, which lead to adjustments in the LCI of pods (i.e., transport vehicles) and stations.\n\nA smaller subset of hyperloop configurations is tested for the entire life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). The reference hyperloop system is also compared to alternative modes of transport: long-distance railway, conventional aircraft and aircraft fuelled with synthetic kerosene.\n\nFinally, sensitivity analyses are carried out with a focus on the varying electricity mixes and occupancy rates.\n\nThe functional unit is one person-kilometre (pkm).", "filename": "1-s2.0-S266691612400015X-main.md"}

Hence, LCA databases describe so-called background processes on which the foreground system of interest (e.g. the hyperloop system) builds. For this purpose, the database ecoinvent v3.8 and its system model ''allocation, cut-off by classification'', is used as the source for background inventories (Wernet et al., **2016). However, the description for goods** manufacturing and service provision that ecoinvent provides accounts for the use of today's technologies, trade patterns and market landscapes and falls short of describing the performance of production systems in the future. For that purpose, the Python library ''premise'' is used to modify the ecoinvent database to align with the projections of a given prospective scenario. In short, premise adjusts the inventories of different economic sectors (i.e., electricity, cement, steel, fuel, transport) to match the trends described in the scenarios of Integrated Assessment Models (IAM) such as REMIND (Aboumahboub et al., **2020)**\nor IMAGE (Stehfest et al., **2014). This results in inventory databases** aligned with future policy scenarios for each year between 2005 and 2100 (Sacchi et al., 2022b). The readers can refer to **PSI and PIK** (2023) for more information about premise. In addition to global IAM scenarios, which include trends for the European region, premise also implements Switzerland-specific projections for electricity supply and import dependency according to the Swiss Energy Perspective 2050+ (Swiss Federal Office of Energy, **2023). This allows us to account**\nfor expected changes in Switzerland regarding electricity supply and other commodities imported from Europe (e.g., electricity imports, steel) or elsewhere.

While these selected categories are presented in the paper, additional impact categories are also available in the Appendix for a more in-depth analysis.\n\nHyperloop is a novel high-speed transport system where magnetically levitating vehicles travel in a near-vacuum environment over medium-to-long distances.

The pod is equipped with magnets that glide over a conductive rail. When the rail changes in the magnetic field due to the passing pod, eddy currents are generated that counteract this change and thus create a field opposite to that of the pod, causing the vehicle to be repelled and levitate. The advantages of this technique are that (a) the system is intrinsically stable, i.e. the force acting on the pod when pushed out of equilibrium height counteracts the change, and (b) the track can be built on the bottom of the tube, allowing for a cheaper and simpler construction, while at the same time allowing for an entirely passive switching system. In this study, the EDS model developed in Hao et al. (2019) and Dong et al. **(2019)**\nhas been employed due to the availability of sufficient technical data.\n\nThis includes the non-negligible electromagnetic drag induced by the system, which the authors characterise as a function of the speed (Hao et al., **2019).**\nTo maintain the superconductive properties of the coils, these are assumed to be submerged in a liquid nitrogen (LN2\n) bath at 77 K.\n\nWhen the pod travels below a threshold speed (about 30 km/h), the lift generated is no longer sufficient to counteract gravity.

The lift-to-drag data from **Hao et al.**\n(2019) estimate the electromagnetic drag induced at different travelling speeds.\n\nThe inertia is the force required to accelerate the vehicle to the top speed, and it is only partially recuperated in the braking stage due to the conversion losses.

This is partly taken care of by the fuselage, which can heat up by some degrees and is then cooled at the station. The onboard phase-change thermal storage absorbs the remaining heat. This storage is also regenerated at the station, but its electricity demand is labelled ''cooling onboard'' in **Fig.** 3.\n\nThe above-ground tube is assumed to have a total length of 300 km, representing the distance between the Swiss cities of Zurich and Geneva. To compare the results to other modes of transport, an occupancy rate of 80% is employed, which is equal to the one assumed in aircraft (Notten et al., **2018)**\n2**. Sensitivity analyses are conducted**\nto explore the impact of varying occupancy rates on the LCA, and the results are presented in **Fig.** 8.\n\nThe main technical and scenario parameters employed in the study are summarised in **Table** 4.\n\nFig. 3 **shows the specific operational energy consumption per pkm**\nfor the reference system (first bar on top) and various sensitivity scenarios (subsequent bars below). The breakdown of the energy consumption by source is also provided for the reference case. Despite the lower environmental pressure in the tube, the aerodynamic drag is still a significant source of energy consumption due to the high speed and blockage ratio, which makes the pod surpass the Kantrowitz limit. In these conditions, the vehicle behaves similarly to a piston, pushing air forward and creating a pressure difference between the front and back of the pod; rather than from friction, most of the aerodynamic drag comes from the effort to overcome this pressure difference. A second important source of energy consumption is the electromagnetic drag induced by the EDS levitation. This component is particularly critical since it generates reinforcing feedback loops for any additional energy consumption: the more energy consumption there is, the larger the battery, the heavier the pod, the more electromagnetic drag, etc.\n\nThe launcher also takes a large share of the energy consumption to accelerate the vehicle to the top speed; however, in this phase, the launcher also works to offset the aerodynamic and electromagnetic drags, with the latter being particularly penalising at lower speeds (Hao et al., **2019). Interestingly, the pumping energy to maintain the vacuum** represents only a marginal share of the energy consumption, thanks\n\nThe sensitivity study also shows the significant impacts of aerodynamics and electromagnetic drag.

{"doc_id": 147, "text": "The capacity of the vehicle also strongly impacts the energy consumption *per pkm* **since the aerodynamic drag is mainly caused by**\nthe pressure gap between the front and back of the vehicle, and this difference is only marginally influenced by the pod length (constant blockage ratio is assumed). For the same reason, higher load factors lead to more pkm per vehicle, lowering energy demand per pkm. On the contrary, the speed does not play a critical role since all tested scenarios occur beyond the Kantrowitz limit, where the aerodynamic drag does not scale with the square of the speed. Similarly, the acceleration rate only marginally influences the overall energy consumption.\n\nThe nominal pod range plays a significant role, as longer distances require larger batteries, hence heavier pods and more energy demand (in this configuration, the energy demand per pkm increases by 18%\nwhen going from a 300 km to a 600 km range). This is similar to the inefficiency of long-haul air travel when carrying the weight of large amounts of fuel3.\n\nThe mechanism adopted to accelerate and decelerate the pod significantly impacts energy consumption, and a more complete discussion is provided in Section **3.2.**\nThe electromagnetic drag is confirmed to be the most impactful technical parameter, and its modelling thus requires careful consideration.\n\nOverall, the most important outcome is that the modelling uncertainty of some technical features impacts energy consumption less than the deliberate selection of less advantageous system designs.\n\nThe impacts on climate change in terms of GHG emissions per passenger-km of the three designed hyperloop systems are shown in Fig. **4. All parts of the systems are included, and the most impactful**\nsub-components are highlighted with darker shades.\n\nA pivotal question of the study is whether the track- or the podside acceleration is superior from an environmental point of view.\n\nSelf-propelled pods must have a more powerful LIM to accelerate to their maximum speed and a larger battery to provide the required energy. This results in a heavier pod that consumes additional energy, especially for acceleration and levitation due to greater inertia and mass. Other sources of additional energy consumption are the greater electromagnetic drag due to the greater lift required and thermal management due to the heat loss associated with the extra energy flow.\n\nIt is, therefore, clear that the track-side version is more efficient from an operating energy point of view (see the last sensitivity of Fig. 3).\n\nHowever, the track-side version requires a large track-side motor to cover the entire distance the pod travels during acceleration, in contrast to the pod-side motor that is just on board. The overall climate impact of the design with pod-side acceleration is thus the lowest because the savings from not using the launcher are only partially offset by the increased demand for LIM and battery capacity. Notably, the podside scenario benefits significantly from the reduced battery footprint in ambitious climate scenarios, while the track-side scenario gains advantages from a lower footprint in the copper production needed for the launcher. It should be noted that the absolute difference would vary considerably with a more GHG-intensive electricity mix in the use phase. Overall, under the assumptions made in this study, the design achieves the lowest GWP without a launcher and recuperator.\n\nThere are fundamental differences in the tube design between concrete and steel, with the latter increasing the climate impact of the system substantially and accounting for more than half of the total GWP. This is due to the relatively high CO2 intensity of the steel needed, as compared to concrete. Additionally, while the GHG intensity of concrete production also decreases in prospective scenarios, the impact from aluminium used in the concrete tube remains comparatively high. As a result, the overall differences in the prospective scenarios for the concrete tube are relatively smaller since aluminium accounts for about half of its environmental impact.\n\nIn the prospective scenarios, the proportional contributions to the total GWP remain consistent across all scenarios, while the absolute values vary, showing reductions of up to one-third in some cases. The effect here would be significantly greater if a more GHG-intensive electricity mix than the one of the Swiss Federal Railways4 **were used.**\nRegarding the first two scenarios, the climate scenario seems to have more influence on the GHG emissions than the design option. The last design option, using a steel tube instead of concrete, is the most sensitive to the climate scenario chosen. Although the CO2 intensity of steel production is strongly declining, as reflected in our scenarios, its contribution to the overall climate impact remains substantial when compared to materials like concrete.\n\nTo provide context for the background data used, we have included a table in the Appendix that outlines the main materials for all impact categories across all scenarios.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S266691612400015X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 148, "text": "Two options for aviation are considered, representing short and very short-haul intra-EU flights over distances less than 800 km and between 800 and 1500 km, respectively. The aircraft transport model, provided by ecoinvent (Cox et al., **2018), represents a generic aircraft with an**\n80% occupancy rate and operating empty weights of 38.3 tons and 43.1 tons for the two distance categories. This results in fuel consumptions of 3.84 kg and 3.08 kg per 100 km per seated passenger for very short-haul and short-haul flights, respectively. The fuel consumption and related emissions data are derived from 99.5% of all scheduled flights in 2016 for that size class, as recorded in the OAG Analytics database (OAG, **2016). We have adjusted the fuel consumption downward by 38% to align with ICAO's very optimistic aspirational goal of a**\n2% annual improvement (Fleming and de Lépinay, **2019) between 2016** and 2040. They are modelled using fossil and synthetic kerosene. The 4 **According to the ecoinvent database the Swiss Federal Railways mix consists of 87.94% hydropower, 10.76% nuclear power and 1.3% new renewables.**\nWith the scenario for 2040 (RCP1.9), this translates to 6.2 g CO2\n-eq./kWh.\n\nConventional aircraft cause by far the highest climate impacts due to the high fuel demand and combustion of fossil kerosene. Climate impacts caused by the train and the hyperloop system are very similar and substantially lower than air travel.\n\nLand use-related impacts are highest for aircraft using synthetic kerosene, mainly due to the space occupied by wind power generation. Trains and planes using fossil kerosene show similar results, with infrastructure contributing the most. The hyperloop system exhibits the lowest land use-related impacts by far, primarily because of its elevated tube structure supported by pillars. It is important to acknowledge that train systems might also utilise elevated tracks5.\n\nIn terms of water consumption, the hyperloop reference case achieves worse results than the two aircraft, but this is almost entirely due to the electricity mix used by the hyperloop (and train), which has a very high proportion of hydropower and, therefore, a higher water footprint.\n\nFurthermore, conventional aircraft and trains consume significantly less material resources than the copper-intensive hyperloop system.\n\nRegarding PMF, the hyperloop system shows the lowest impact, and the plane using synthetic kerosene is the highest. The train causes much higher PMF than the hyperloop system, mainly due to the abrasion of the tracks.\n\nMoreover, in terms of summer smog, the hyperloop and train systems have the lowest impacts, while both aircraft significantly contribute to higher impacts, primarily due to emissions from kerosene combustion.\n\nWhen considering energy efficiency, represented by the CED, both hyperloop and train show a similar and much better performance than both aircraft options.\n\nBreakdown of climate impacts For each transport mode, total climate impacts are broken down by emission source: Infrastructure (stations, airports, tubes, rails), vehicles\n(pods, aircraft, trains), electricity demand during operation (and as feedstock for synthetic kerosene), fuel supply chain (production and distribution) and operation emissions (CO2\n, SF6\n, refrigerants, etc.). This more detailed comparison of the climate impacts caused by hyperloop and other modes of transport is shown in Fig. **6. The upper part of** the graph shows all contributions, which for the e-kerosene aircraft includes both the operational CO2 emissions due to fuel combustion and the same amount of CO2 captured from the atmosphere by the DAC unit\n(used for e-kerosene production), shown as a negative contribution. The lower part of the figure represents a zoom-in, in which these two components of the life cycle cancel out each other, corresponding to a net balance.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S266691612400015X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 149, "text": "Per passenger-km, the environmental impact of the aircraft itself is lower than that of trains and the pod in the life cycle of the vehicles, mainly due to the large number of pkm that aircraft cover during their lifetime, which distributes the footprint among more passengers. The pod of the hyperloop system particularly shows a significant footprint, primarily due to the batteries' central role in the pod life cycle. The train has an impact comparable to that of the pod. Although it does not require emission-intensive batteries, its lifetime pkm is lower than the expected lifetime pkm of the pod. Aircraft powered by e-kerosene solve the fossil fuel problem, as the CO2 emitted while in use equals the CO2 **absorbed by DAC to produce the fuel. However, due to the**\nlow conversion efficiency of electricity to fuel, the net electricity consumption of these aircraft is much higher for e-kerosene than trains or 5 **However, trains face unique challenges when elevated, such as increased**\nnoise and vibration (Xia et al., **2009), as well as potential cost and durability**\nconcerns (Chen et al., **2016). Although hyperloop pods and train wagons**\nare comparable in weight, hyperloop causes much less wear and tear on the infrastructure due to the absence of contact provided by levitation. In terms of vibrations, the structural system still has to support the full weight, and vibrations will occur in hyperloop as well. In terms of noise, hyperloop can avoid load noise due to contactless suspension and guidance (as opposed to trains) and travels in an enclosed tube.\n\nThe infrastructural carbon footprint is similar for all transport systems. In the case of air transport, airports still require large land areas and consume a lot of energy for their ground operations. In addition to electricity and heating, airports must include maintenance and clearing operations. However, it should be noted that the aircraft maintenance is partly allocated to the airport in the inventory of the ecoinvent database. The difference between the railway and the hyperloop infrastructure is primarily due to the assumed utilisation of the routes and the resulting lifetime pkm. The utilisation factor for long-distance trains in Switzerland is 28%, while a utilisation of 80% is assumed for the hyperloop system. While the latter is decidedly optimistic, the higher modularity of the vehicles and the more frequent departures could allow for a timetable better adapted to demand and a higher load factor.\n\nMoreover, load factors of 80% are typical for air transport (ICAO, **2022)**\nand are used in ecoinvent (Notten et al., **2018). For a more appropriate**\ncomparison of the impact of the infrastructure, Table 5 **shows climate**\nimpacts associated with one metre (bidirectional) of railway track, concrete tube, and steel tube.\n\nThe less material-intensive railway track causes lower GHG emissions per metre than the hyperloop tube. Nevertheless, more intensive use of the hyperloop infrastructure pays off the infrastructure's environmental investment, as seen in Table **5. The differences in the**\nenvironmental impacts of concrete and steel tubes have already been discussed. However, it should be noted that detailed dynamic analyses of the material performance under specific stresses should also be carried out before conclusions can be drawn.\n\nCompared with other transport systems, the hyperloop reference case was compared with the Swiss long-distance train, conventional aircraft transport and the e-kerosene-powered aircraft transport as discussed in Section **3.3. The aircraft with conventional fuel is independent of the foreground electricity supply here. Although electricity**\nis used at the airport for maintenance, this is difficult to allocate and would have only a marginal overall influence on the total life cycle. On the contrary, the climate impacts of electrified trains, hyperloop systems and planes using e-kerosene depend on the GHG emissions associated with electricity supply for train and hyperloop operation and e-kerosene production, respectively. Fig. 7 **shows this dependency.**\nWhile trains and the hyperloop system cause GHG emissions lower than very short-haul aircraft (even without their non-CO2 climate impacts)\nup to a carbon intensity of more than 1000 g CO2\n-eq. per kWh of electricity. In contrast, e-kerosene aircraft cause higher GHG emissions than conventional aircraft at about 100 g CO2\n-eq. per kWh of electricity.\n\nFor reference, the current average GHG emissions of the high-voltage", "filename": "1-s2.0-S266691612400015X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 150, "text": "As the occupancy rate of transport systems is a critical parameter regarding their environmental performance and as figures for the hyperloop system cannot be based on empirical data for this technology, we analyse the sensitivity of climate impacts regarding occupancy rates. This sensitivity analysis is simplified in that it ignores the effect of passengers' weight on the operational energy consumption of all vehicles. It should be noted, however, that the energy consumption of an aircraft, in particular, is more negatively affected by additional passenger weight than the energy demand of a train (Sullivan et al.,\n2018) and the hyperloop. This simplified scaling of climate impacts as a function of occupancy rates of the selected transport systems is shown in **Fig.** 8.\n\nIf all transport systems have the same occupancy rate, the train causes the lowest climate impacts. The difference to the hyperloop system is negligible at high occupancy rates. Even at a relatively low load factor of about 25%, the hyperloop systems and the train would still perform better than the fully occupied e-kerosene-powered aircraft. At full utilisation, the conventional aircraft performs several times worse than the train and hyperloop system with a very low load of e.g., 10%. However, the exponential increase of climate impacts caused by the train and the hyperloop system at very low load factors below 10% indicates that such use cases should be avoided. Given that hyperloop combines railway advantages such as central access with airplane-like operation of end-to-end vehicles on highly frequented routes, the authors expect that occupancy rates similar to airplanes can be reached. It shall also be said that railway, given that it would operate with small vehicles on highly busy routes could achieve similar occupancy rates.\n\nThe factor with the highest influence on the LCA results is the assumed utilisation rate or the transported lifetime passenger count of the hyperloop systems. Due to the assumptions made here, the high environmental investment costs are distributed over an increased number of passengers and the resulting environmental burdens, especially GHG emissions, per passenger-km are very low.\n\nThe second largest significant parameter is the chosen electricity mix for operating the hyperloop system. In the almost optimal scenario with the electricity mix from Swiss Federal Railways, only about 10%\nof the total climate impact is attributable to this mix. However, if an almost entirely coal-based electricity mix were used, about 95% of the total GHG emissions would be attributable to it. To put this into context, the annual electricity consumption resulting from the modelled hyperloop route is about 1360 GWh, corresponding to approximately 2% of Switzerland's current final electricity consumption.\n\nIn many impact categories, especially climate impacts, the tube as a subsystem causes the highest impact under the default assumptions made here. In particular, the aluminium used and the clinker required for the cement cause the most significant impact in the case of the concrete tube; for the steel tube, on the other hand, it is mainly the pig iron for the steel causes that has the greatest impact.\n\nThe influence of the station varies greatly depending on the environmental impact indicator. For some of the impacts used here, the effects are almost entirely due to the station's high copper demand. It can be shown that there are considerable differences in the dimensions of the launcher or recuperator. With its battery, the pod has a smaller impact on the overall life cycle for most LCIA indicators and scenarios. The fuselage itself is almost negligible in relative terms. The exception is the hyperloop with pod-side acceleration, which requires a higher battery capacity, increasing the impact. However, the more significant influence in the overall life cycle pays off in all impact indicators, as the impact of the launcher and recuperator is more than compensated.\n\nWhat remains are the operational fluids, which are negligible in relation to the rest of the overall system in all methods.\n\nEvery effort was made to obtain and process as much hyperloopspecific data as possible. Nevertheless, assumptions had to be made at several points, or alternative datasets had to be implemented because not all the desired processes could be realised due to the prospective nature of the LCA.\n\nVery accurate data could be obtained for the cement and concrete production, as the primary data were directly available here. The remaining materials were either scaled up accordingly from existing but on a much smaller scale, subsystems or taken from the literature. The associated production flows were almost wholly based on ecoinvent representing similar systems and scaled where necessary. The exception is the Superconductor, Hastelloy C276, silicon steel and the recycling of CFRP, where secondary data other than ecoinvent was used, none of which significantly impacted the overall environmental performance.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S266691612400015X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 151, "text": "Regarding EOL, simplifications had to be made that will probably not reflect reality in the future, as much higher recycling rates are expected compared to today. Inventories for appropriate future recycling processes are unavailable in the databases and could only have been modelled based on rough assumptions. To ensure consistent comparability, it was decided to use the current market activities from ecoinvent (which include specific fractions of recycled materials) or to apply a cut-off approach to waste likely to be recycled in the future if only incineration or landfill processes were available in the ecoinvent database, as these end-of-life options are likely to be less common in 2065 and later to be able to meet the climate goals (Gallego-Schmid et al., **2020). Especially in the case of aluminium, concrete, copper and**\nsteel, a higher assumed recycling rate would significantly improve the LCA results for most of the LCIA indicators used here.\n\nThe ''right'' choice of electricity mix is difficult. Therefore, several future scenarios were assessed, and a detailed sensitivity analysis was made about the electricity mix, which shows its significant impact on LCA results. Furthermore, it was assumed that the hyperloop infrastructure would be used exclusively for passengers. However, it is planned to transport goods at night, as demand for passenger travel is lower.\n\nThis has not yet been considered and would reduce the environmental impact assigned to passengers, as part of the infrastructure would also be allocated to transporting goods, just as with trains and aircraft.\n\nThe crucial parts of the hyperloop system were modelled. However, the thermal management and HVAC systems were simplified. Moreover, the flux pump and the life support system were not considered. The life support system for the hyperloop system has yet to be developed and was therefore not included in this analysis. In principle, the system used in submarines could be used. Adding such an emergency system to the LCA is not expected to cause major environmental burdens, as it will not include any large infrastructure elements or energy consumption.\n\nA comparison with other studies is challenging because there are no LCAs for other hyperloop systems, and for Maglev trains, only two studies (Kato et al., 2005; Kato and Shibahara, **2006) have assessed**\nthe Shinkansen and SCMaglev in Japan, which report emissions ranging from 14–43 g CO2\n-eq./pkm. However, due to the vastly different temporal and spatial conditions, a direct comparison is not feasible.\n\nNevertheless, the comparison with existing studies with limited scope was able to classify the impacts resulting from this LCA and to check them for plausibility. However, even if another system uses the functional unit pkm, the extent to which the system is comparable to other transport systems should still be questioned. This is because the functional unit does not refer to the temporal dimension, which is why the comparison between train and hyperloop systems is only of limited significance, which has also been shown in the different utilisation of the infrastructure. Changing the functional unit from pkm to pkm/h is possible to make the other systems more comparable.\n\nThis work has only considered a point-to-point hyperloop system and does not yet simulate a broader network with various pod sizes and fleet configurations anticipated in future implementations. The study focuses on an overground design, pending further data collection for alternative setups. Addressing complex routing within an extensive network, including timetabling and capacity analysis, was beyond the scope of this initial assessment. Nonetheless, we expect the general environmental ranking of Hyperloop, compared to other transport modes, to remain consistent even with network expansion, due to its designed efficiencies.\n\nThe bill of materials for the current launcher is based on a design used in a 120-m demonstration tube. Therefore, an optimised design could significantly reduce material requirements and change the outcome of comparing track-side and pod-side acceleration regarding environmental assessment.\n\nOverall, mainly conservative assumptions were made with regard to the hyperloop systems. Yet, it outperforms the aircraft in almost all environmental impacts and shows an environmental performance similar to a train. Since the main focus of this LCA is on GWP, the hyperloop with pod-side acceleration can thus be called the most promising hyperloop system, based on the results of this LCA.\n\nThere are, however, challenges in the feasibility of the hyperloop that need to be addressed or resolved: Although cost estimates exist, the financial resources required for development and construction are unknown, especially if the central stops in metropolises are to be realised. Further technological problems also need to be solved, such as the vehicle's thermal management, shock waves in the tube, and the management of charging at stations.\n\nOur first-of-its-kind environmental life cycle assessment of a hyperloop system shows that the hyperloop has a high potential as an energy-efficient, low-carbon, high-speed passenger transport option.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S266691612400015X-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 152, "text": "The primary condition is that the electricity supply for its operation is associated with low GHG emissions. Second, occupation rates similar to those of current long-distance trains can be achieved, preferably as high as observed in aviation. Major environmental trade-offs are not to be expected. On the contrary, compared to major competitors, i.e., long-distance trains and intra-EU aircraft, hyperloop trains show reduced particulate matter formation and land use. These fundamental findings hold despite hyperloops' current status as ''technology in development'', which comes along with uncertainties regarding technical properties and design choices of future hyperloop systems.\n\nIf additional transport capacity is required, especially at higher velocities, the question is whether conventional transport systems can provide it or whether new and more sustainable alternatives should be considered. It may, therefore, be possible to add a new mode of high-speed transport to the current network and shift large parts of the emission-intensive short-haul flights to sustainable, entirely electric ground-based modes of transport. Overall, our study shows that the hyperloop can indeed combine the speed of an aircraft with the environmental footprint and capacity of a train, filling a major gap in the future transport network and potentially helping to meet climate targets in the transport sector. However, it is essential to recognise potential caveats, which need to be clarified in detail. This includes the technical feasibility of its suggested transport capacity or likely safety risks. Despite travelling in a vacuum, hyperloop still consumes a considerable amount of energy, albeit far away from the inefficiency of an airplane.\n\nPaul Beckert: **Writing - original draft, Visualization, Software,**\nMethodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization.

Entrepreneurs are making the most of these advancements, creating novel means of transportation and negotiating intricate regulatory environments. This study uses a detailed systematic literature review to identify innovation and entrepreneurship opportunities in micro-mobility solutions. The study explores how technology transforms micro-mobility by introducing intelligent, app-based solutions, Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity, and battery innovations. Micro-mobility provides theoretical avenues for examining complex subjects like societal effects and sustainable business models. \n\nTechnological integration, innovations, and entrepreneurship in micro-mobility solutions have practical implications for reshaping urban transportation. Micromobility solutions play a crucial role in the perspective of sustainability. Analyzing these implications promotes the evolution of micro-mobility solutions in cities by informing practical tactics for entrepreneurs and policymakers, in addition to advancing academic research. The works of literature in the English language available in the various databases are considered for theoretical exploration. The study's novelty is based on the structured literature review on innovations and entrepreneurship in micro-mobility solutions without any time limit. The findings will offer insights into the need to develop and improve micro-mobility solutions to impart sustainability in urban areas. \n\nIn today's world, there are different problems. Among these problems, environmental pollution is one of the significant difficulties [141]. \n\nEnvironmental pollution is in the form of \"water pollution,\" \"air pollution,\" \"soil pollution,\" \"light pollution,\" \"thermal pollution,\" \"plastic pollution,\" \"industrial pollution,\" \"municipal solid waste,\" and \"acid rain\" [97]. Commercial activities such as manufacturing, mining, building, etc., release pollutants into the air, water, and soil [135]. The chemical gases from vehicles, such as \"carbon monoxide,\" \"and nitrogen dioxide\" lead to air pollution [137]. Hence, vehicle emission is a reason for environmental pollution [109]. Most people prefer to live in urban areas. Vehicle usage is comparatively high in urban areas and less in rural areas. Hence, vehicle emissions can be considered the reason for air pollution . When we compare the cities and rural areas, pollution is higher in cities than in remote locations [14]. In this case, Micro Mobility Solutions (MMSs) are vital in minimizing pollution problems and promoting sustainability. According to [31], \"MMS's role in the urban area is decarbonization and making life eco-friendly.\" The role of MMS is not limited to one or two roles; it extends to multiple areas, such as sustainability and decarbonization in urban areas, ultimately leading to urban planning, transportation, and business, especially in entrepreneurship, technology, etc. Sarasini, Langeland [101]. Micro-mobility solutions are used as a transport mode in urban areas, significantly eliminating or decreasing the use of private vehicles for nearby travel [1]. Micro mobility solutions like electric scooters, bikes, etc, are gaining popularity as beneficial solutions to problems such as pollution and urbanization. This is an attempt to identify the role of innovation and entrepreneurship in solving urbanization problems and promoting environmental sustainability. Micro-mobility solutions help to reduce carbon emissions by offering nature-friendly transportation modes. \n\nThe study contributes to creating sustainable urban transportation by examining innovations and entrepreneurial endeavors in this field. Rapid development in the micro-mobility sector opens the doors for entrepreneurs, investors, and job seekers. Policy and investment decisions can be influenced by having a detailed knowledge of the economic effects of entrepreneurship in this industry. Now, solutions like electric scooters, electric cars, and e-bikes are considered the best solutions for difficulties. This study helps us understand how innovations and entrepreneurship can drive solutions to mitigate urban mobility issues. The study contributes to the broader goal of achieving sustainable urban transportation by analyzing innovations and entrepreneurial efforts. There is a drastic change in the micro-mobility industry. This study is trying to explore digital transformation in micro-mobility due to the innovation of new solutions such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and battery innovations. These inventions significantly influence the transportation sector, entrepreneurship, and the technological landscape. \n\nMicromobility often operates within a complex regulatory environment.

This study intends to offer insights to policymakers, entrepreneurs, and the general public. The study of innovations and entrepreneurship in Micro Mobility Solutions is essential because there is a need to understand the changes happening in the urban environment and transportation. Small-scale electric vehicles, including bicycles, ebikes, and scooters, help mitigate environmental pollution. \n\nThis study can suggest helpful and creative solutions to increase the effectiveness and sustainability of urban transportation. Due to their ability to reduce carbon emissions and air pollution, micro-mobility solutions may contribute to a more sustainable and green future. We can better understand how to make the most of these environmental benefits by researching innovations and entrepreneurship in this industry. Entrepreneurs and investors now have new economic options thanks to the micro-mobility sector. The economic importance of this industry, especially the potential for investment and economic growth, can be highlighted by this study. With its simple last-mile connectivity to public transit systems, micro-mobility solutions frequently fill in the gaps in the transportation chain. This is particularly important for reducing commuting times and boosting overall city transportation effectiveness. Access to convenient and affordable transportation is a significant problem for many areas. By providing accessible options to various consumers at reasonable prices, micro-mobility solutions can potentially increase transportation equity. This study can evaluate how different socioeconomic groups are affected by micro-mobility. The proliferation of tiny mobility solutions raises questions about safety and regulatory issues. To create the proper legislation to safeguard the safety of users and pedestrians, politicians and city planners might benefit from research advances in this field. \n\nThe study can examine how technology, such as mobile apps, IoT \ndevices, and data analytics, affects micro-mobility. Entrepreneurs and creative thinkers who want to improve the field must comprehend its technological facets. Understanding consumer behavior and preferences about micro-mobility can be pretty insightful for businesses and governments. This knowledge can direct the creation of user-friendly and effective services. Micro-mobility options help make transportation networks more environmentally and economically friendly. Research into these developments is essential in light of climate change and the necessity for environmentally friendly transportation solutions. This study applies not only to certain cities but also to the entire world. This research is helpful for global comparisons and cross-border collaborations because many cities worldwide are adopting micro-mobility solutions. The study has many significant ramifications, from resolving urban mobility issues and environmental concerns to promoting economic growth and social fairness. It is an essential and contemporary area of study that can influence how transportation will develop in cities worldwide. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S294989962400011X-main.md"}

This study delves into the various variables that have shaped the emergence of micro-mobility solutions. These include urban transportation, environmental concerns, technological advancements, regulatory frameworks already in place, and more. The scholarly investigation will produce a deeper comprehension of the origins and development of MMS. The innovations in MMSs are the following significant elements covered in this paper. Because innovation trends are being explored, this is significant. The literature provides information on evolution, micromobility models, innovative marketing trends, etc. The study's primary focus is on MMS entrepreneurship and innovation. As a result, understanding the success characteristics of startups and other businesses can be gained by examining current entrepreneurial activities through literature reviews. Nowadays, it is essential to consider MMS \nfrom a sustainability point of view. The effects of these solutions on the environment's sustainability and how they mitigate environmental risks, including carbon emissions and other greenhouse gas emissions and urban development. In summary, the literature analysis offers policymakers recommendations for future research areas. The research findings, contributions, and conclusions can effectively guide future research. \n\nThe 203 documents available from 1991 until 2023 are taken for the comprehensive review analysis. \n\nMicromobility solutions developed quickly. In the early years of MMS development, they depended on the station-based system [111]. At first, the most popular micro-mobility option was an e-bike [55]. \n\nNew-generation sharing solutions then became available. \n\nDockless-based systems are the leading pioneers in this regard. This represents the main evolution that MMSs have undergone. According to Shaheen and Chan [107], \". 2500 cities have bike-haring systems, and classify these changes into three phases, denoting different generations of bike-sharing schemes, the system dynamics and demand dynamics in bike-sharing systems are the main subjects of the research\". There has been a substantial evolution from station-based to dockless micro-mobility systems [86]. MMSs are widely used because of advancements in technology. Mobile devices can now be linked to MMS \nand made reservations via Applications (Apps) [111]. Instead of depending solely on car purchases, the sharing system encourages people to consider micro-mobility solutions [70]. Urban environmental and social issues are the primary focus of the first generations of micro-mobility projects [1]. In contrast, the second generation introduced coin-deposited bicycle locks. The third-generation bike-sharing system, which integrates smartphones and tracking, uses technology [98]. The fourth generation is primarily concerned with lowering carbon emissions through multimodal connections [1]. The study of micro-mobility solutions is changing. E-bikes, e-scoopers, and other e-bike-related multimodal solutions have replaced the bike-sharing system. Experts are researching MM's function. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S294989962400011X-main.md"}

It entails organizing a carefully considered search strategy that clearly emphasizes or responds to a stated question. The review specifies the categories of data that were looked up, analyzed, and reported within predetermined timeframes. The review must contain the search terms, search tactics (including database names, platforms, and dates of search), and limits. Pittway [96] states, \"seven principles of SLR \nare transparency, clarity, integration, focus, equality, accessibility, and coverage.\" Systematic literature reviews are rooted in medicine and connected to Evidence-Based Practice (EBP). Grant and Booth [48] state, \n\"The rise of evidence-based practice has resulted in a greater diversity of review styles.\" They list the advantages and disadvantages of each of the \n\nKeywords used in the search for documents in micro-mobility solutions. \n\nThe weather and climate will influence the adoption of MMS. Moderate weather or climate is primarily preferable for MMS [64]. There are limitations for older users, and drivers must wear helmets. Integrating micro-mobility with the current transportation infrastructure is difficult for many places. The public's varying awareness of micro-mobility solutions is the second cause of the variation. MMS coverage may be impacted by incorrect information on safe usage and a lack of comprehension of the advantages of micro-mobility. A rising number of people prefer private single-track cars for urban transportation after the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to the escalating price of electricity, long-range, super-lightweight, compact electric vehicles are preferred \n[130]. New types of transportation are being made possible by innovative technology and commercial concepts. Innovative globally popular mobility services have been introduced over the last 15 years. \n\nExternal and internal factors and developments influence the micro-mobility market. These elements determine how enterprises and innovations grow and evolve in this field. Van Den Heuvel et al., [128]. Many functional and non-functional elements impact whether or not a person chooses to employ an e-micro mobility mode of transportation. \n\nNon-functional factors like environmental awareness, inventiveness, and belonging might be even more powerful for an individual than conventionally functional variables like speed, cost, and time savings. Users view these services as socially advantageous since they promote livability, access equity, and choice. The adoption of electronic micromobility may be substantially influenced by several sociopsychological elements that frequently have concomitant effects on decision-making. \n\nWhen choosing a mode of transportation, consumers still have traditional needs related to functional values. Associations that people form about certain modes and values connected to specific social, emotional, and epistemic demands, including environmental attitude, creative personality, and societal views, will be tied to non-functional values [110]. \n\nGreater urban population density increases the need for costeffective and environmentally friendly transportation options, spurring innovation and opening up business opportunities. The growing interest in eco-friendly micro-mobility options results from greater public awareness of climate change and environmental problems, motivating businesspeople to provide sustainable transportation options. Regulations can encourage or prevent micro-mobility development [112]. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S294989962400011X-main.md"}

Micro-mobility innovation is driven by practical, economical, and environmentally friendly transportation choices demanded by consumers [87]. New and existing competition may be powerful drivers of innovation regarding features, pricing, and market share. Innovative ideas and enterprises in micromobility can grow due to easy access to funding and investment opportunities. By giving access to resources, infrastructure, and knowledge, strategic alliances with other businesses, local governments, and public transit systems can promote innovation [147]. For micro-mobility solutions to be successful, adequate infrastructure, such as bike lanes, charging stations, and parking facilities, is essential, and this frequently necessitates working with local governments [86]. The cultural acceptability of micromobility options and social norms around transportation can influence the success of businesses and innovations. The adoption of micromobility solutions might be influenced by the region's economic stability and disposable income levels. A major problem is ensuring the security and safety of users [27]. Technology and safety feature advancements can give business owners a competitive advantage. Micromobility service innovation can be sparked by access to real-time data and analytics for route optimization, customer behavior, and maintenance requirements [87]. Micromobility tendencies have been influenced by occurrences like the COVID-19 outbreak as individuals look for alternatives to conventional public transit [117]. \n\nCorporate and governmental sustainability goals can make micromobility solutions that support these goals possible. Consumer education on the advantages of micromobility and the proper usage of these services can promote acceptance and innovation [51]. Local innovation and entrepreneurial prospects may be influenced by global trends like the increase of e-scooters and e-bikes [46]. Micro-mobility solutions may be influenced by changes in lifestyle, such as a preference for urban living and an emphasis on health and well-being [3]. Entrepreneurship in the micro-mobility industry depends heavily on the capacity to innovate products and services based on ongoing user input. The dynamic interplay of these elements affects innovation and entrepreneurship in micro-mobility solutions profoundly, and successful enterprises in this field are those who can successfully adapt and respond to these effects. \n\nAdopting new technology and creating novel mobility concepts will lead to innovation in the transportation sector. As evidenced by the introduction of several new applications, business models, and specializations and the entry of new actors, the current transportation sector is undergoing significant changes [22]. The development of socio-technical solutions like micro-mobility is fueled by technological innovation because it establishes incentive structures in a market-based economy where supply and demand are responsive [72,83]. In the case of electric mobility, battery technologies' affordability and compactness are a game-changer [140]. The smartphone revolution's reliance on lithium-ion battery advancement. This transformation in the political economy of the transportation industry creates opportunities for new players and alliances. In other cases, like the market for electric cars, it tempts existing players to adjust to position themselves best during the sectoral transition [116]. Other innovations like skateboards and push scooters have only had a minor impact. However, in recent decades, there has been a noticeable trend in urban planning to prioritize these modes of transportation in many cities through infrastructure improvements like bicycle lanes, wider pavements, and car-free zones \n[144]. The market for shared transportation services is expanding rapidly. Introducing new vehicle types and expanding the services and functions offered are efforts to raise service quality [127]. Strong policy support for \"smart city\" solutions is another significant trend. In the 2010s, lofty rhetoric and lobbying for digital solutions essential to sustainability and high-life quality led to a generally favorable attitude towards high-tech, electric interventions in most urban landscapes and leading, influential urban policy circles [123].

According to [129], \"electric micro-mobility actors may be able to expand quite smoothly and quickly, albeit with variations in strategies across socio-political contexts, by capitalizing on two positive trends: \nthe economic competitiveness and compactness of electric batteries, as well as public perceptions of and growing policy support for such solutions as essential to developing better, more sustainable urban transportation systems. This poses problems for governance since innovation and market-making frequently happen more quickly than governance actors can keep up with them\". The network of Smart Hubs is an innovative Internet of Things application that offers a more intelligent user experience to all city users, but notably to the elderly [139]. The need for confidence and credibility among the agents engaged, as well as solid ties between various organizational contexts, makes innovations in transportation systems somewhat slow [57]. The STT paradigm thus \n\"provides a useful formula for interpreting the social and technical dynamics and complexities involved in sustainable transitions,\" like mobility systems [21,43]. \n\nAs a novel kind of shared transportation for individuals, e-scootersharing programs have taken over sizable urban areas worldwide. Despite all the advantages of e-scooter sharing systems, their performance depends on how well people accept and adhere to them\". \"Shared micro-mobility is used by youngsters like male students studying in university-level education with full employment without having any extra responsibilities like taking care of children, etc. However, it is not the same for shared e-scooter owners. They are also youngsters and more representative such as education, full-time employment, income, and gender than bike-sharing people\". Hence, we can say that e-scooters create equity in transportation [99]. Service-based mobility, called \n\"Mobility As a Service,\" is a new kind of service that allows consumers to plan, reserve, and pay for many kinds of mobility services through a single digital channel [56]. [115], said, \"Open innovation can be seen in the creation of MaaS systems.\" It is regarded as an instance of innovation, a deliberate yet fundamentally conditioned process that involves both the creation and application of novel, challenging ideas [115,124]. New mobility solutions and emerging technical trajectories frequently result from cross-sector technological flows across related but separate industries, making it possible for those sectors to evolve, combine, or even integrate [40]. According to [146], \"the processes of standardization, broader e-bike inclusion in bike-sharing schemes, regulation of charging infrastructure, and \"stratification\" of e-bike transportation define the current transitional dynamics.\" The practices of e-bike mobility are likely to be impacted by these processes: meanings are changing, new skills and competencies are relevant, and socio-material arrangements are changing. Urban micromobility's growing importance worldwide and the expanding function of electric two-wheelers designed to support mobility as a service are two characteristics of the current transition dynamics. However, developing technical innovation is difficult [22,93]. \n\nSocial enterprises with a dual focus on revenue generating and social purpose include UP Bike Share. The financial dimension is one of these goals that motivates social companies to create and grow their product's market [120]. According to [134], \"Markets are concrete exchange structures between producers and consumers, and therefore, market creation requires not only the entry of producers and the legitimation of practices but the organization of relationships within and between communities of producers and consumers\". Shalender [108] emphasizes the necessity of creating strong business models and an entrepreneurial mindset for electric vehicles. Epochal shifts have occurred in the movement of people and products via transportation. There is now a test for established market players and a chance for new players, including startups. The automotive industry's two problems are autonomous vehicles and the transition from internal combustion engines to electric propulsion. \"Mobility on demand\" (mobility-as-a-service, MaaS) is a trend that refers to shifting from owning a car to service-based mobility. Customer expectations drive demand for new services (Firnkorn and Muller, 2015). ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S294989962400011X-main.md"}

Startups focused on transportation encounter difficulties in developing new machinery, automobiles, infrastructure, electromobility, and operationalizing transportation procedures, particularly those related to public transportation and micromobility [114]. The main goal of increased attention to electromobility should be to create National and International Innovation Hub-Labs for E-mobility Services and Products, providing real-time guidance and enhanced benchmark experience [30]. Entrepreneurial potential in micro-mobility solutions offers essential insights into the beginnings, development, and difficulties of new businesses and endeavors in the quickly developing micro-mobility space. Creating new markets or submarkets is a common entrepreneurial opportunity in micro-mobility. New transportation modes, like e-bikes, e-scooters, and shared mobility platforms, are often introduced by startups, which open up new market opportunities. There can be a significant benefit to entering the micro-mobility market first. Businesses that take advantage of chances during the early phases of a market's development can build their brands and become industry leaders. Micromobility firms use business strategies that include multimodal platforms, dockless sharing, and subscription services. A key theme is realizing which models work best in certain situations. Micromobility entrepreneurs have to maneuver through a complicated regulatory landscape as local governments set guidelines for the functioning and security of these services. Research on the effects of regulations on corporate tactics and innovation is expected. Highlight how micromobility technologies may help the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and relieving urban congestion. Entrepreneurs looking to maximize their products must understand what promotes or discourages uptake. Micromobility has several potentials for innovation and technology-based entrepreneurship. This field of study investigates the effects of new technologies on company plans and user experiences, including the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and improved battery technology. \n\nEntrepreneurs frequently form alliances and partnerships with conventional transportation agencies, local governments, and urban planners to extend their services and incorporate them into larger transportation ecosystems. Business owners encounter difficulties regarding profitability, scalability, and operational effectiveness. One of the most critical aspects of micro-mobility entrepreneurship is addressing these issues while preserving environmental sustainability. The entrepreneurial ecosystems for micromobility in many nations and areas emphasize how local elements affect business prospects. Another major issue in the research is the broader socio-economic effects of micro-mobility solutions, such as increased accessibility, lower healthcare costs, and the creation of jobs.

The primary forces behind their innovations include shifts in consumer tastes, market developments, societal demands, and ecologically friendly practices [16]; because they open up possibilities for short-distance travel, micro-mobility solutions are significant [1]. The MMSs changed throughout the previous few years. This is a brand-new, creative phenomenon. Their emergence was primarily prompted by technological advancements, urbanization, shifting consumer preferences, and the contemporary emphasis on sustainability \n[66]. Introducing practical and environmentally friendly electric two-wheelers is the primary MMS practice in urban transportation. They are less expensive than the current modes of transportation. Introducing GPS systems and IoT sensors is the critical technological evolution associated with micro-mobility solutions. Dockless systems provide the flexibility of gathering and sending off cars. Numerous startups and businesses are examining the potential for cooperation with the current transportation platforms while considering the infrastructure and regulatory frameworks. The development and application of micro-mobility solutions show how innovation, technology, entrepreneurship, and urban planning interact dynamically [28]. Micro mobility is the term used to describe compact, frequently electric-powered modes of transportation intended for short trips within cities. As cities look for efficient, sustainable substitutes for conventional transportation methods, these solutions—including electric scooters, bikes, and shared mobility services—have recently become popular [133]. Conventional transportation is transformed into the MMS with an emphasis on sustainability issues. Building infrastructure in industrialized nations that is appropriate for micro-mobility solutions increases the reach of those solutions [1]. Regions are developed by cooperation and policies that uphold the MMS. The user experience of convenient urban transportation is made possible by mobile app platforms. Reducing the amount of traffic and relying less on non-renewable resources encourages micro-mobility solutions, which help cities' air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. The result of startup innovation is the creation of business models. The result of innovation by MMS-engaged startups and organizations is the creation of business models. The countries' regulatory framework benefits MMS in terms of licensing, safety, helmets, parking, speed, etc. The application and assessment of MMS impact business models, collaboration, regulatory frameworks, technological breakthroughs, and the importance of sustainability objectives. \n\nThe transportation landscape is constantly changing due to new technology, such as the emergence of micromobility, a new term for lightweight human-powered or electric vehicles operated at low speeds. \n\nWithout more focused interventions by local stakeholders, the sustainability consequences of these modalities are currently inconsistent and are likely to stay that way. However, the use and operation of micromobility systems are rapidly developing and show promise for helping to create a more sustainable transportation system [77]. The concept of sustainable transportation has been evolving and maturing since the early 2000s [142]. According to [33], \"sustainable transportation results in the emission of fewer Green House Gases (GHGs) and reduction in the use of nonrenewable resources (especially petroleum)\". This emphasizes equity and access, a common theme throughout the literature on sustainable transportation. Equity objectives in transportation systems encompass many aspects of sustainability. The demand for small, adaptable, and more environmentally friendly modes of transportation has increased due to the expansion of transportation. Recent advancements in the micro-mobility sector suggest that these gadgets may solve this problem and provide travelers with shorter, safer, and more affordable travel [11]. Sustainable transportation aims to increase safety and living standards, prioritize public transportation, pay more attention to pedestrian demands, and advance society's involvement in transportation [51]. To evaluate the sustainability effects of shared micro-mobility, it is necessary to consider emissions and other effects from the entire life cycle. Regarding different modes of transportation, LCA studies cars by looking at each component, such as the body, electronics, batteries, amount of fuel used, maintenance procedures, and infrastructure use. New, more practical modes of transportation are being made possible by shared micromobility systems (SMSs), while greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with transportation are also being reduced [92].

{"doc_id": 167, "text": "Micromobility is often considered a sustainable solution to many urban mobility challenges. However, new micromobility services are not always the best environmental solution for urban mobility unless the eco-design of vehicles is improved and they are strategically used and deployed as part of a holistic vision for transport policy [38]. According to [1], \"theft and vandalism, redistribution, availability, safety concerns, and related rules are difficulties nowadays\". [95] point out that the incorrect parking of bicycles, e-bikes, or e-scooters on sidewalks or other shared pathways was one of the significant obstacles to shared micro-mobility systems. In addition, he also noted that the absence of a legal framework, ambiguous regulations, and poor design of riding and parking facilities could all pose difficulties for shared micro-mobility. In conclusion, summarizes as Micro mobility, which encompasses vehicles like electric scooters, bicycles, and shared transportation services, is crucial for advancing sustainability from several angles. Micromobility, which encompasses vehicles like electric scooters, bicycles, and shared transportation services, is crucial for advancing sustainability from several angles [17]. Compared to conventional fossil fuel-driven cars, micro-mobility choices emit fewer greenhouse gases because they are often powered by electricity or human labor [74]. Micromobility can help relieve traffic congestion and reduce emissions by minimizing idling time and fuel consumption. Micromobility promotes effective land use and may lessen the demand for large parking lots because it uses less space on the road and for parking [105]. Micromobility can be incorporated into public transportation networks, providing first- and last-mile solutions, obviating the need for private vehicles, and advancing environmentally friendly urban planning [23]. Since micro-mobility services frequently require maintenance, redistribution, and support services, they help boost local economies and create jobs [61]. Transportation is more economically feasible for a more extensive range of people because micro-mobility alternatives are frequently more reasonable than purchasing and maintaining a personal automobile [106]. Micro-mobility services broaden accessibility by enabling quick, affordable, and short-distance travel, which can lessen social disparities in access to transportation. Common types of micromobility, like walking and cycling, encourage physical activity and better public health, which supports social sustainability [18]. Micro-mobility choices, particularly bicycles and e-scooters, typically cause less severe accidents than conventional cars, making transportation systems safer. Particularly when compared to private automobiles or even public buses, micro-mobility options are frequently very energy-efficient, helping to promote sustainability through improved energy consumption. Electric vehicles are substantially noisier than electric micromobility choices, which results in less noise pollution and can improve the quality of life in urban settings (Mesimaki and Lehtonen, 2023). \n\nMicro-mobility services can encourage people to choose more environmentally friendly modes of transportation, lowering their dependency on private automobiles [81]. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that the sustainability impact of micro-mobility might vary based on elements like regional laws [106], infrastructure, and the electricity source used to power electric micro-mobility cars [87]. The long-term viability of micro-mobility also depends on addressing safety issues and guaranteeing equitable access to these services. \n\nSustainability comprises environmental goodness, social well-being, and also financial enrichment. Hence, integrating this consideration with the industry strategies will generate better sustainable results. The focus on sustainability is different among developing and developed countries. Nowadays, developed countries mainly focus on resource utilization by paying attention to the environment. However, developing countries rely on environmental concerns, but they also strive to eradicate poverty and mitigate issues in necessities for people's lives.

The variation in sustainability in different markets presents different challenges and opportunities. The sustainability issues are different across industries. It is variant in industries based on their industry focus. According to Osterwalder and Pigneur [89], \"a business model is the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value, and they provide a practitioner's tool to operationalize this; the Business Model Canvas \n(BMC), which has become one de facto standard for business model development\". The improper outlining systems of the innovative business models [7]. Sustainable business models impart value to the environment and stakeholders. Hence, evaluating sustainable business models is the driver for business transition. According to Lee et al. [63], \n\"the business model is a new unit of discussion and analysis for sustainability initiatives\". The challenges of business models can be eradicated through the standard designing based on the tools and processes of business models. According to [104], \"Sustainable Business Models (SBM) a means that \"helps describing, analyzing, managing, and communicating (i) a company's sustainable value proposition to its customers, and all other stakeholders, (ii) how it creates and delivers this value, (iii) and how it captures economic value while maintaining or regenerating natural, social, and economic capital beyond its organizational boundaries\". According to [19,13], \"the principles that guide the development of sustainable business models are; 'Principle of sustainability orientation' relies on the transition of sustainability to business models; 'extended value creation' focus on the defining of value and the triple bottom line; 'systemic thinking' on consideration of direct and implications, and adaptation of integral perspective; stakeholder integration involves of multi-stakeholders in SBMs; and 'contextual sensitivity' urgency for the awareness of users in the SBM process\". \n\nSustainable development is encouraged by the business models. Products with recycling, repair, and reuse capabilities are more widely accepted. Thus, this approach to the life cycle of products will promote sustainable development. The critical market aspects are comprehension of consumer preferences, rivals' sustainability initiatives, current strict government laws, etc. The scarcity of resources and concerns about climate change make the markets difficult. Difficulties underscore the significance of optimizing resource utilization and mitigating over-exploitation of resources, as well as the responsibility of climapreneurs in mitigating the effects of climate change on their businesses. It is possible to lessen the prevalent inequality in industries by implementing policies that enhance worker happiness by paying fair salaries, creating a healthier environment, and raising awareness through sustainability-themed awareness campaigns. The Triple Bottom Line (TBL) approach, impacting business model performance, focuses on social responsibility, environmental responsibility, and economic sustainability. \n\nThrough information sharing, resource sharing, idea sharing, technology sharing, and risk reduction, the partnership and collaboration with stakeholders lead to group action for sustainability [85]. The ongoing detailed valuation will aid in understanding the course of the sustainable development path. Long-term viability as a beneficial contributor to society and the environment will result from the TBL strategy combined with linked goals [75,79]. Sustainability should be an organization's primary value instead of financial considerations. Their objectives' integration with sustainability will benefit the environment and society. The circular economy is still being discussed. Waste is decreased when circular economy principles are incorporated into the creation of business models. It reduces reliance on non-renewable energy sources by promoting resource conservation, repair, recycling, and reuse [41]. Sustainable business models and general environmental well-being will result from business models that adhere to the most recent Sustainability Goals (SDGs) and Environment, Social, and Governance (ESGs) [15]. Businesses must take corrective action and follow up to ensure their business models are heading correctly. Sustainable change can be easily achieved through stakeholder collaboration [125]. Cost savings, resource efficiency, and ecosystem enhancement will come from a willingness to engage in innovation through technologies that address sustainability [103]. The active participation of stakeholders—suppliers, customers, workers, etc.—will drive sustainable change [26]. These enhancements to the business models will create a sustainable ecosystem. \n\nThe dilemma encountered by micro-mobility is that the deployment of micro-vehicles often exceeds actual demand, resulting in low utilization rates and economic inefficiencies. In this scenario, startups and enterprises pay attention to the place where the demand for MMS is high. With the help of technological innovations such as big data will help them to map the factors such as preferences, and patterns that are determining the utilization rates [114]. Technology innovations emerged in the battery, materials, designing increase the life and reduce costs in a sustainable and economically beneficial way [1].

The next important way to increase the utilization rate of MMS is to the application of integrated solutions that incorporate micromobility with various transportation modes [86]. The new startups or new practices focusing on the niche market within the current broader micro-mobility market offer opportunities [120]. The innovation of micro-mobility solutions such as e-bikes, e-scooters, electric cargo bikes or family-sized bikes, etc based on the family requirements, age distribution for the sub-urban areas having the longest duration as compared to urban with the long battery life will increase the entrepreneur's role in the extension of MMS other than metropolitan area s \n[84]. The easy access to MMS through a geographical-based docking system can increase the utilization rate [94]. The startups can develop the MMS exclusively for a particular university attention on the faculties, students, staff, etc with discounts that will increase the utilization rates. \n\nThe perceptions of users are the shared micro-mobility solutions are derived from the reactions towards the traditional types of transportation modes that heavily depend on fossil fuel [11]. The current patterns of usage, demand for the products, and the impacts have significant roles in micro mobile penetration [66]. The reaction of these influencers will drive better decision-making and business model development for startups and enterprises. The motive for the time-saving is the major drive for people to access MMS [9]. However, e-vehicles have fewer strengths as we differentiate them from fossil-fuel-driven transportation systems [24]. Hence, there is an urgency for start-ups to increase the high-strength MMS to meet the customer utilization rate. The integration with existing transportation systems through first-mile and last-mile connectivity and the collaboration with municipal authorities will promote the rise of startups [47]. \n\nAccording to [4], \"social entrepreneurship is rapidly changing, and trends are influencing how we respond to critical social and environmental issues\". Hence enterprises have a significant role in environmental protection The McKinsey report says that there is a low utilization rate for shared MMSs with an average of 0.9 trips per day in cities [36]. This opens the door for new ventures to focus their efforts on innovations in design, operational strategies, marketing, and segmentation of the market, leading to a higher utilization rate. The startup can focus on the MMS in high-demand areas based on the data-driven approach to decision-making helps to solve undersupply or over-supply challenges [76]. The successful examples of innovative practices and the startup role encouraging the utilization rate are the \"Spin\" e-scooters which integrated with public transport and utilize data-driven decision-making for the deployment leading to a high utilization rate. \"Voi\" entered into a partnership with the local authorities by following sustainability with the usage of swappable batteries having integration with public transport [12,138,20,60]. Hence, the focus on sustainability, integration with authorities, public transport, technological advancements, regulatory support, user experience, new entrants, and data-driven deployments are the room for new startups and practices in micro-mobility leading to overall efficiency. \n\nEnterprises are failing due to poor management [29]. Based on industry standards, 9 out of 10 startup companies experienced a failure which was largely due to poor management of the company and lack of funding [121]. \"Ofo\", \"Scoot Networks\", \"Muving\", and \"Bluegogo\" are examples of startups fallen. About 90 % of startups fail in the first 5 years, according to observations in America revealed in Forbes magazine, 2015 and the same phenomenon occurs in Indians discussed in Business Line, 2017 [121]. This situation may not be much different from other countries. The high investment costs are required in the micro-mobility sector. The major sources of costs are; the acquisition cost of the primary fleet of scooters, e-bikes, etc, the repairs and maintenance cost, charging vehicles, infrastructure deployment cost, operational cost on warehouses, transportation, etc, administrative cost, factory cost, prime cost comprising direct material cost, labor cost, other overheads including insurance, license, and permit costs, marketing, customer support, depreciation, etc. Technology adoption, continuous research, and development costs are other sources that lead to a deficit in operational revenue [91]. The technology adoption helps in the transfer of services faster [4]. \"Bluegogo\" is a Chinese bike-sharing company that encountered issues due to poor management, and cut-throat competition. Hence, the management's financial problems, the absence of adaptability to changing needs, competition, etc are the reasons for the closing down of MMS startups.

Structured planning by relying on technology, and optimizing supply chains reduces the cost by overcoming the problem arising from the mismatch between the demand and supply [1]. \n\nThe prioritization of high-demand areas and distribution will reduce inventory and storage costs, transportation costs, etc. Integration with public transport is another way to reduce costs and increase utilization [8]. The partnership with vehicle manufacturers by availing discounts, or indirect purchasing modes such as leasing, and subscriptions will reduce the huge vehicle acquisition costs [34]. The battery swapping system will help reduce the costs incurred for charging the battery [2, 102]. \n\nMicro-mobility solutions' evolution and emergence, including electric bikes, electric scooters, and other vehicles, make urban transportation easier with a focus on environmental safety [133,54].

Normally, micro-mobility solutions including electric bicycles preferred for short-distance travel reduce carbonization in the transport sector. The micro-mobility sector encounters the environmental challenge through the scrapped vehicles due to vandalism, and technological obsolescence [100]. Scrapped bicycles generate waste not only the metal frames, but also it includes plastic substances, rubber tires, and electronic particles from electric vehicles [82]. The production of bicycles requires materials such as lithium for batteries, steel, aluminum, and rubber for tires, etc [49]. The scrapping of bicycle rate enhancement and the turnover leads to the demand for these materials created from the depletion and mining of natural resources causing unfavorable environmental impact.

Lead-acid batteries have an environmental impact, as compared to lithium iron phosphate batteries which contributes to the positive environmental impact [69]. If the disposal is through the burning of material, it will create harmful toxins and generate greenhouse gas emissions. The improper disposal will create health problems. The new bicycle production through different stages contributes to the carbon footprint emissions. The enterprises that dispose of the scrapped bicycles increase their operating expenses and incur high costs, and it is considered a symbol of resource efficiency due to inadequate utilization of the cycles for the full life span. The large volume of scrapped bicycles due to heavy usage or vandalism has significant sustainability implications especially in the waste generation, disposal, burning of scrapped bicycles, greenhouse gas emissions, and release of carbon footprint due to the manufacturing of new bicycles [132]. The circular economy practices consist of recycling, the reuse of batteries, the life cycle of bicycles, utilization of echelons will reduce the negative impact of the environmental impact of batteries [68]. The measures for the extending bicycle life span through high-quality investment and modular design, maintenance programs, and education for reducing vandalism and misuse, emphasize the circular economy practices including recycling and reuse of salvage parts for the production of new bicycles, usage of biodegradable material as far as possible, smart locking systems and GPS for tracking vandalism [132]., rerun bicycles programs from the MMS users after the usage will help in the disposal through proper way for recycling, reuse, and disposal by reducing damage to the environment \n[10,88]. \n\nThe primary focus of existing works is presented in Table 3. \n\nTable 3 and Fig. 3 exhibit the synthesis of past literature.

The research aids in locating and examining new business models in the micromobility space. It looks at how entrepreneurs have used technological breakthroughs to create cutting-edge services and goods that meet the changing transportation needs of urban populations, such as electric scooters, mobility apps, and intelligent infrastructure. The study adds to the larger conversation on how entrepreneurship may be promoted by analyzing micro-mobility solutions' sustainability and environmental impact. It offers knowledge of environmentally friendly urban transportation systems. For entrepreneurs in the micro-mobility industry, understanding user behavior and adoption trends is essential. The study contributes by illuminating how consumers engage with and use these services, assisting businesspeople in improving their product offers and user experiences. This report emphasizes how technology helps micro-mobility businesses succeed. It looks at how IoT, connectivity, and data analytics developments have allowed companies to develop more intelligent and effective mobility solutions. This study adds to a thorough understanding of how entrepreneurial innovation has focused on micro-mobility. Entrepreneurs, decision-makers, and scholars attempting to understand and contribute to the fast-changing world of micro-mobility and its function in contemporary entrepreneurship. Micromobility, which includes bicycles, shared transportation services, and electric scooters, is essential for promoting sustainability from multiple perspectives. Micro-mobility options produce fewer carbon emissions than traditional fossil fuelpowered cars because they are frequently powered by electricity or human labor. Micromobility can help ease traffic congestion and lower emissions by reducing idling time and fuel usage. Because micromobility requires less room for parking on the road, it encourages efficient land use and may reduce the need for ample parking lots. By integrating micro-mobility into public transportation systems, ecologically friendly urban design can be advanced, first- and last-mile solutions may be provided, and private automobiles can be avoided. Micro-mobility services contribute to the growth of local economies since they regularly call for maintenance, redistribution, and support services. Micromobility options help large groups make affordable transportation because they are cost-effective compared to owning and operating a private vehicle. Micro-mobility services make speed, cost-effective, and the nearest travel, and they try to mitigate social discrimination in access to transportation. Typical forms of micro-mobility, such as cycling and walking, help to increase good health. The sustainability impact of micro-mobility may differ in various circumstances. Micro-mobility options make Transportation networks safer, particularly e-scooters and bicycles, which usually result in fewer significant accidents than traditional autos. Micro-mobility choices are often very energy-efficient compared to private autos or public buses. This helps to promote sustainability through improved energy use. Electric vehicles are significantly noisier than electric micromobility options, reducing noise pollution. Compared to electric micromobility options, electric vehicles are significantly noisier, which reduces noise pollution and can enhance urban living conditions. \n\nBased on the research findings, the recommendations and managerial strategies tailored for micro-mobility firms and the policymakers are discussed here. The study reveals an urgency for continuous investment in innovative micro-mobility technologies to enhance efficiency, better experience, and safety, such as IoT-enabled GPS, sensors, and other new digital trends. Micromobility firms should adhere to the regulations and identify and engage opportunities to navigate and reform existing policies and programs to create safe and effective micro-mobility solutions in different regions. Micro-mobility firms should enlarge their focus to diversified offerings, including two-wheelers such as electric bikes, electric scooters, pedal-electric bikes, etc, to cater to consumers' needs and contribute to sustainability. Micromobility solutions encourage environmentally sustainable options in their products. Hence, there is a need to integrate their operations, resources, etc, with the optimum utilization and reduced exploitation of natural resources. The efforts must be undertaken to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Environmental, Sustainable, and Governance \n(ESG) goals. The batteries' circular economy reuse and recycling activities are crucial for achieving sustainable goals. The awareness programs, including the helmet-sharing programs, will help the customers become aware of the safety measures and responsible behavior-based safety driving among the micro-mobility users. The broader reach of micro-mobility solutions firms, by collaborating with the government to adopt innovative solutions in the prevailing public sector transportation system, will enhance enterprises' use of micro-mobility solutions. \n\nPolicymakers can frame new innovative micro-mobility by encouraging regulations. The government must encourage innovators and game changers, including the social enterprises running the micromobility ventures, by paying attention to sustainability concerns, safety standards, user convenience, and better customer experience.

Rural entrepreneurs are recognizing the urgency to incorporate information and communication technology in the decision-making and community life. There is a scope for the rural entrepreneur's active engagement with the help of technological innovations [5]. Hence, there is an urgency for policymakers to intervene to attract micro-mobility firms in rural areas and offer better transportation opportunities. The framing and implementation of schemes offer subsidies and assistance for product development, processes, campaigns, marketing, etc., and the tax credits will be a supporting hand for the micro-mobility firms. The inadequate bike lanes, parking spaces, battery charging facilities, etc, are problems experienced by micro-mobility users. Government intervention in collaboration with private industries to solve these challenges will increase the use of micro-mobility solutions. The partnership and collaboration of government with private entities will be an excellent step for developing infrastructure and the acceptability of micro-mobility solutions. The users' lack of awareness can be reduced through the policymaker's intervention through campaigns, positive behavior, and driving by strictly obeying the traffic rules. Regular communication between the government and micro-mobility enterprises will be fruitful for framing policies, urban transportation planning, and traffic initiatives. \n\nApplying these recommendations and managerial strategies for micro-mobility firms and policymakers will increase the sustainable use of micro-mobility solutions. The collaboration of policymakers and micro-mobility firms offers better transportation with clear, consistent, need-based, innovative policies and regulations that ultimately provide a pathway to the future of sustainable transportation. \n\nThe study experienced certain limitations. The review may be constrained by the lack of pertinent literature on micro-mobility solutions, mainly if it is a new area of research. Language barriers may cause nonEnglish literature to be excluded, thus losing out on necessary research and insights from other languages. The rigor and quality of the examined research may differ, which could impact the general validity of the conclusions and the feasibility of making specific inferences. The limited generalizability of the examined literature may be due to its concentration on specific micro-mobility solutions (such as e-scooters and bikesharing). Evaluating entrepreneurship and innovations' long-term viability and success in the micro-mobility sector may be challenging because some studies lack longitudinal data. Micro-mobility solutions frequently converge with several disciplines, including urban design, transportation, and technology. It is possible that the review did not correctly incorporate these other fields' insights. Finally, this study is purely literature-centered. Hence, the advantages of applying primary data and quantitative analysis are lacking. This study has these limitations. However, this exploration contributes more insightful knowledge on the theme of entrepreneurship and innovations in micro-mobility \n\nAdopting innovative mobility concepts and new technology, which drive innovation in transportation, leads to significant transformations in the industry. The innovation of lithium-ion batteries in battery technologies impacts electric mobility because of their tiny size and affordability. The emergence of \"smart city\" solutions and Cycling as a Service (CaaS) marks a significant advancement in urban mobility. Transportation practices are being reshaped by Mobility as a Service \n(MaaS) systems, an example of open innovation. They emphasize the shifting meanings and relevant skills that impact e-bike transportation. \n\nMicro-mobility entrepreneurship is booming, especially in the rapidly expanding electric two-wheeler sector. New modes like e-bikes and escooters are pioneered by startups, who use early market access to create their brands and gain industry supremacy. These endeavors use a variety of tactics. These endeavors utilize a variety of tactics, including dockless sharing and multimodal platforms, while maneuvering through intricate regulatory structures established by regional administrations to guarantee efficient and safe operations. Research focuses on how rules affect company strategies and innovation in this ever-changing environment. Maintaining environmental sustainability while balancing profitability, scalability, and operational effectiveness is a crucial component of a micro-mobility business. Companies must deal with these issues when developing entrepreneurial ecosystems in countries where local conditions significantly impact commercial opportunities. In addition, studies explore the broader socio-economic implications of micro-mobility, including improved accessibility, lower healthcare expenses, and employment generation, highlighting the industry's diverse influence.

The study explicitly underscores the influence of travel satisfaction and attitudes towards conventional modes of transportation on the adoption of innovative alternatives such as air taxis within the context of mode choice scenarios. \n\nUrbanization and population growth have led to the proliferation of vast metropolitan areas, contributing to the exacerbation of traffic-related issues. Growing congestion around the world has increased interest in innovative time-saving alternatives and has also resulted in increasing commuters' propensity to pay higher prices for time-efficient mobility options (Rothfeld et al., 2018). The \n* Corresponding author. \n\nE-mail address: msamadzad@ut.ac.ir (M. Samadzad). \n\nRecent technological advancements for a new class of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) craft have the potential to enable urban air taxis (UATs) as a solution for many problems such as traffic congestion and environmental issues for both intra-urban and inter-urban travel (Straubinger et al., 2020). However, various factors may be considered as barriers to public acceptance of UAT, including technical issues such as noise and altitude, as well as safety concerns (Cohen et al., 2021; Yedavalli and Mooberry, 2019; Straubinger et al., 2020), it is important to analyze how UAT can compete with traditional ground transportation modes in common scenarios and understand individuals' preferences while integrating UAT within transportation systems. As is the case with autonomous vehicles (AVs), Kolarova and Cherchi (2021) suggest that understanding the factors that affect users' preferences for these technologies is crucial for developing precise and varied scenarios about their impact on travel demand and mode choices. The same applies to UAT, since this perspective is crucial for studying public acceptance of UATs and passenger demand, especially given that human-operated ground vehicles still dominate the transportation landscape (Rothfeld et al., 2018). \n\nWith the idea of probable integration of UATs in urban mobility and its corresponding characteristics, the question must be asked: Is there a possibility that ground motorized modes as the primary modes of transportation will eventually be supplanted by UAT, thereby alleviating the congestion that plagues the streets below? What is the impact of factors like time and cost on the decision-making process of individuals when selecting UAT as a transportation option? Furthermore, how do attitudes and past experiences relate to alternative travel modes influence the preference for UAT? \n\nIn light of the numerous variables that have the potential to influence individuals' inclinations toward UAM, it is imperative to gain insights into the underlying causes of variability in UAM preferences. This understanding is vital for crafting more nuanced and realistic scenarios concerning how UAM might influence transportation mode choices and overall travel demand. The present study seeks to make a meaningful contribution to the existing body of literature by examining the impact of travel experiences (specifically, satisfaction with daily travel) and attitudes toward various travel modes within a hypothetical context on preferences for air taxis. \n\nAdditionally, this research aims to provide empirical substantiation regarding the degree to which these factors, along with the socioeconomic characteristics that underlie them, shape individuals' preferences for UAM. This paper provides insight into these concerns to develop and validate a framework that can be scaled to evaluate the competitiveness of urban air taxis against conventional transportation modes. In other words, the objective is to evaluate the utility of UAT in comparison to traditional ground transportation modes, which are major contributors to traffic congestion and air pollution. This study examines the mode preferences of individuals in hypothetical situations that involve UAT, private cars, and ride-hailing, with respect to the influence of overall current travel satisfaction, and attitudes towards each alternative as the latent variables. The two ground transportation modes were chosen based on their significant share of the commuting market, (Lesteven and Samadzad, 2019), and comparability with UAT in terms of travel cost, comfort, and convenience. The significant disparity in pricing between public transport and UAT, with the former being heavily subsidized in Tehran (Heger and Sarraf, 2018) and the latter being almost 50 times more expensive, renders these two modes of transport incomparable. Consequently, with public transport being used for the shortest distances (Kreimeier and Stumpf, 2017), it was excluded from consideration in this analysis.

{"doc_id": 177, "text": "The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the relevant literature on autonomous transportation, UAT \nadoption, and the value of time. Section 3 discusses the surveying process and the methodology of the paper. Section 4 provides the statistical analysis of the survey data, as well as the definition of the latent variables by factor analysis of the indicators and the analysis of the latent constructs by structural equation modeling. Section 5 characterizes the choice of travel mode using a multinomial logit model and examines user preferences including the value-of-time estimates. Finally, Section 6 discusses the results and concludes with recommendations for the integration of urban air mobility within the general context of an urban mobility system. \n\nIn recent years, the development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has brought attention to the concept of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and the utilization of urban air taxis (UAT). The advancement of fully autonomous aircraft may not be directly aided by the development of autonomous vehicles for road travel, although there is substantial overlap in the underlying technologies required for both (Holden and Goen, 2016). Recent advancements in electrification, automation, and electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft have catalyzed the development of urban aviation, leading to the emergence of innovative aircraft designs, services, and business models (Cohen et al., 2021). The convergence of these trends has opened up new possibilities for on-demand aviation in terms of passenger mobility and goods delivery within urban areas, as noted by Patterson et al. (2018). It is currently widely recognized that smaller electric propulsion aircraft equipped with vertical take-off-and-landing capabilities, which can operate from heliports or similar infrastructure, have the potential to serve on-demand mobility missions (Garrow et al., 2018). \n\nSeveral research studies have examined the various impediments to the successful implementation of eVTOL technology which can be considered as community acceptance and the critical determinants of its adoption (Al Haddad et al., 2020; Karami et al., 2024; Vascik and Hansman, 2017). According to Garrow et al. (2020), the viability of an urban air taxi service is dependent not only on technical proficiency but also on the level of consumer demand. Al Haddad et al. (2020) conducted a stated-preference survey to evaluate the perception of users regarding the adoption of UAM. The study revealed that several factors were critical in determining the adoption of UAM, including safety and trust, the preference for automation, social attitude, as well as socio-demographic characteristics. Choi and Ji (2015) also mentioned the significance of trust in the adoption of AVs. In another study, Winter et al. (2020) \nfound six major determinants of customer desire to ride autonomous air taxis: familiarity, value, enjoyment, new technology wariness, fear, and happiness. In the evaluation of the viability of UAM services, Hasan (2019) identified affordability and consumer willingness to pay as potential impediments to the practicability of UAM operations. Similar to Garrow et al. (2021), who mentioned that while providing service levels that surpass those of existing modes of transportation, UAM must also be priced at a point that is deemed reasonable by individuals. A survey conducted with the objective of investigating the acceptance of UAM among European citizens (EASA, 2021) highlighted that the primary apprehensions voiced by respondents pertained to safety, security, and environmental considerations. \n\nUsing the technology acceptance model, Johnson et al. (2022) explored the expectations and perceptions of passengers regarding the use of passenger air vehicles (PAVs). Respondents expected PAVs to meet the same safety standards as conventional aircraft, including features like seatbelts and air quality. Bansal et al. (2016) investigated the potential advantages of AVs and the factors that may affect their adoption. They found that male urban residents and individuals with higher income, technological proficiency, younger age, and greater accident experience exhibit greater interest and willingness to pay for novel technologies. Based on an exploratory survey conducted in five metropolitan regions: Houston, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, and Washington, D.C., Shaheen et al. (2018) ascertained that a robust determinant affecting individuals' inclination to use UAM services, as well as their ultimate decision to embark on a UAM journey, is their level of familiarity with the UAM concept. They underscored the vital significance of public educational initiatives in the process of ushering in UAM as an emergent and innovative mode of transportation. \n\nHohenberger et al. (2016) found that women exhibit lower interest in the adoption of autonomous vehicles compared to men. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0965856423003051-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 178, "text": "Similarly, in a study of the UAM market barriers in the United States, Goyal et al. (2018) concluded that male respondents are more willing to utilize UAM services. Shaheen et al. (2018) also found that men, younger respondents, and wealthier participants displayed a higher willingness to utilize UAM services. EASA (2021) revealed that certain demographic segments exhibited a more favorable disposition towards UAM. These segments encompassed younger individuals, specifically those aged 25–34, males, individuals with higher income levels, and those who were familiar with and accustomed to using other innovative services. \n\nWhile the majority of studies have focused on the factors affecting the perception of individuals towards using UAM, there is a lack of research on the adoption of UAM in a mode choice scenario. According to Haan et al. (2021), air taxi services could be profitable in the early stages of launch in markets such as New York City and Los Angeles, as revealed through their mode choice analysis. Rimjha et al. (2021) conducted an estimation of the demand for UAM within the airport ground access sector of Los Angeles International Airport and found that it has the potential to capture approximately 3.6 % of the market share in airport access trips. In a study by Fu et al. (2019), four transportation alternatives were included in mixed logit, multinomial logit, and nested logit models using an SP survey in Munich metropolitan region. These alternatives were private car, public transport, autonomous taxi, and autonomous flying taxi. The results of the study revealed that travel time, travel cost, and safety were crucial factors in determining the adoption of UAM \nand that the potential customers may have a higher willingness to pay for using these services. Furthermore, socio-demographic characteristics were found to be highly influential in UAM adoption, with younger individuals and those with higher incomes being more likely to use. Similarly, Castle et al. (2017) also observed that younger individuals with higher levels of education exhibit a greater propensity to utilize pilotless aircraft. \n\nThe significance of psychological factors and perceptions of potential users in the assessment of AVs and UAT has been wellestablished in the literature. Some studies have underscored the significance of safety in the acceptance of autonomous aerial vehicles (MacSween, 2003; Fu et al., 2019; Al Haddad, 2020) and AVs (Yap et al., 2016). The literature has also extensively addressed trust in technology as a determining factor in UAM adoption (Al Haddad, 2020) and AV use (Yap et al., 2016). Ashkrof et al. (2019) \nhighlights that trust in autonomous vehicle technology is one of the most significant psychological factors that influence individuals' willingness to ride AVs. Additionally, the impact of travel experience in AV adoption has been explored in the literature (Ghazizadeh et al., 2012; Pud¯ane et al., 2019). (Kim et al., 2022) indicate a positive relationship between trust and the intention to utilize UAM. \n\nMoreover, among the factors contributing to the trustworthiness of UAM, safety perception emerges as the most influential factor.

{"doc_id": 179, "text": "Numerous studies in the field of transportation have assessed travel mode attitudes by inquiring about the extent to which respondents associate positive attributes such as relaxation, safety, and enjoyment with specific modes of travel (De Vos et al., 2022; Kroesen et al., 2017). Meanwhile, travel satisfaction encompasses both emotional experiences during travel and cognitive evaluations of the entire journey or specific stages of the journey after completion (De Vos, 2018; De Vos et al., 2022). Regardless of the mode of transportation, a trip will elicit a range of affective reactions that will ultimately determine how satisfied travelers are with their travel experience (Ettema et al., 2010). The existing body of literature in the field of transportation explores the relationship between travel behavior and travel satisfaction (Cao and Ettema, 2014; De Vos, 2019; De Vos and Witlox, 2017; Mouratidis et al., 2019). The literature has also extensively discussed the significant impact of attitudes toward various travel modes on travel behavior and mode choice (Cao et al., 2009; Molin et al., 2016; Ton et al., 2020; Habib et al., 2014). Vahedi et al. (2021) utilized structural equation modeling to demonstrate that satisfaction and attitudes, played a significant mediating role between background variables and active commuting. However, the current state of research in the area of UAM indicates a shortage of studies that have investigated the impact of travel satisfaction and attitudes toward different travel modes on mode choice scenarios. \n\nConcerning factors that can influence an individual's perception of travel satisfaction and their overall attitude towards the mode of 3 transportation they use, Ye and Titheridge (2019) found that individuals with lower income levels tend to experience lower levels of satisfaction with their travel. According to Anable and Gatersleben (2005) and Smith (2013), individuals who utilize bicycles experience a greater level of satisfaction with their travel experiences. Smith (2013) also discovered that the job status of commuters and the travel time of their commute are significant factors that influence their level of travel satisfaction. In their study, Morris and Guerra \n(2014) found that bicycling was associated with the most positive emotional outcomes, whereas driving a car elicited slightly less positive satisfaction. On the other hand, individuals who relied on public transport, such as buses and trains, experienced the most negative emotional responses. Mao et al. (2016) discovered that bicycle riders report higher levels of satisfaction. They also highlighted that individuals who possess a greater degree of flexibility in their commuting patterns tend to exhibit higher levels of satisfaction, as they are afforded a greater range of options when selecting their preferred mode of transportation. \n\nWithin the framework of a developing country, Ilahi et al. (2021) found that UAM exhibits promise for growth within the Greater Jakarta region. However, its feasibility may be limited to affluent residents and long-distance journeys. Notably, the pronounced traffic congestion prevalent in Jakarta offers a distinct advantage to UAM over alternative modes of transportation. In Tehran Karami et al. \n\nThe literature exploring urban air mobility frequently draws comparisons to the studies carried out on autonomous vehicles due to the shared characteristics and potential effects of these travel modes on urban mobility. For instance, Kolarova and Cherchi (2021) \nshowed that psychological factors, such as travel experience and trust, contribute to the heterogeneity of the value of travel time significantly. Additionally, the study found that gender, age, level of education, and experience with similar systems have direct and indirect effects on the value of time through their influence on individual attitudes. Furthermore, Kolarova and Steck (2019) found that access/egress time was perceived as slightly more onerous than the in-vehicle time while the effect of wait time appeared to be in the same range as that of the in-vehicle time.

Kreimeier et al. (2018) confirmed that the demand for urban air taxi services is influenced by both cost and travel time, significantly. A number of studies have investigated the value of time for individuals who intend to use air taxi services. In Munich, Fu et al. (2019) estimated the value of total travel time - which is the sum of in-vehicle and out-of-vehicle travel times - equal to 55.0 dollars per hour. In Dallas and Los Angeles, Song et al.

(2021) estimated the value of in-vehicle and out-of-vehicle travel time equal to 25.7 and 15.4 dollars per hour, respectively. \n\nBased on the existing literature, numerous studies have been conducted to explore the impact of behavioral factors and various parameters including time, cost, and sociodemographic characteristics. However, the current state of research in this field still exhibits several shortcomings. A thorough examination of the literature reveals two key issues: (i) most previous investigations have primarily focused on the influence of psychological factors on the intention to use UAM exclusively (Al Haddad et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2022). Nonetheless, concentrating solely on UAM may introduce biases when predicting future travel behavior. Consequently, neglecting the role of different modes hampers our understanding of the state of UAM. (ii) Previous studies have also overlooked the consideration of travel experience in conventional vehicles, which can be viewed as a competitor for UAT. The literature highlights that travel experience, attitudes, and satisfaction significantly impact mode choice. Moreover, while prior research has acknowledged the influence of various factors such as sociodemographic variables, cost, and time, the integration of these factors with psychological elements within a unified framework represents a recent development in the literature. Examining the relative impact of specific psychological concepts and sociodemographic characteristics on the selection of different transportation modes presents an intriguing area of investigation. Understanding the relative significance of these factors in shaping mode choice would contribute to the knowledge in this field. \n\nGiven the unavailability of operational urban air taxis for direct observation or use (Cohen et al., 2021), a Stated Preference (SP) \nsurvey interview was conducted using a face-to-face approach from mid-July to early September 2022 in Tehran to develop a mode choice analysis by integrating UAT with conventional ground modes. The survey aimed to determine the primary drivers of urban air taxi UAT adoption by utilizing a questionnaire that included textual and visual explanations of the concept. The implementation of a mode choice model involves estimating the model parameters to maximize the likelihood that an individual chooses to use the observed alternative as a function of the characteristics of the individual and the attributes of the modes. \n\nTo conduct the research, a comprehensive framework was established for selecting the specific group of individuals to participate in the survey. In this context, the target group consisted of individuals aged 18 and above residing in Tehran. Individuals under the age of 18 were excluded from the study sample because of their lack of driving experience, which would limit their capacity to make an informed choice among considered alternatives. A random sampling technique was employed to select survey participants. This approach was instrumental in ensuring that the individuals surveyed came from diverse backgrounds and demographics within each subgroup. Before the survey interviews took place, participants were provided proper information about the survey's objectives and purpose. Informed consent was sought and obtained from each respondent before proceeding with the face-to-face survey interviews. \n\nThese interviews were conducted by trained interviewers, ensuring that the data collected were both detailed and standardized in nature. \n\nFollowing data cleaning, the final sample size for analysis consisted of 507 respondents. The questionnaire was structured into four parts. The first part included questions on respondents' current travel patterns, such as the most frequently used transportation modes and the average travel time for the mentioned trips. The second part involved a seven-point Likert scale (Likert, 1932) psychological statements that aimed to assess the perceived satisfaction with the mentioned trips. This part also included five-point Likert scale attitudinal statements that aimed to assess individuals' attitudes toward each travel mode (private car, ride-hailing, and UAT), \nconsidering factors such as convenience, comfort, relaxation, safety, and environmental compatibility.

{"doc_id": 181, "text": "In the third section of the study, eight scenarios present stated choice situations with suggested attributes of the service including trip duration and fare. These scenarios are adapted to Tehran and present a hypothetical trip with three available modal alternatives including private car, ride-hailing, and urban air taxi. Table 1 summarizes the eight scenarios. For private car travel time and cost are the only attributes while for ride-hailing and air taxi alternatives access time is also considered. \n\nThe final part of the questionnaire comprised questions regarding the socio-demographic and economic attributes of the participants, including age, gender, education, occupation, and income. \n\nThe approach assumes that mode choices are determined by a decision-making process that incorporates both observed and unobserved factors. Latent variables are utilized to represent unobserved factors that reflect personal psychological perceptions during the daily commute and attitudes toward high-demand ground transportation modes. The Biogeme software package (Bierlaire, 2023) \nis applicable for estimating multinomial logit models that involve latent variables. Latent variables can be created through structural equation modeling of ordinal logit regression models, which consider the ordered nature of responses. Fig. 1 depicts the modeling framework for this approach, depicting the connections between the latent variables and the observed mode choices. This modeling approach offers a robust and adaptable framework for examining mode choice behavior. \n\nAttitude, considered a central element within the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991), plays a significant role in influencing behavior. In the present study, we have developed specific attitudinal items, denoted as private car, ride-hailing, and urban air taxi \n\nIn general, it is widely accepted that customer loyalty and behavior are predominantly influenced by satisfaction (Lai and Chen, 2011). Furthermore, numerous studies have consistently identified customer satisfaction as the primary driver of positive behavioral intentions (Chen, 2008). Many previous studies in the literature have examined satisfaction in the context of mode choice (De Vos, 2019; De Vos et al., 2015; Kolarova and Cherchi, 2021; Sivasubramaniyam et al., 2020; Smith, 2017). Therefore, we also assessed the level of satisfaction among survey participants regarding their experiences with current conventional transportation modes. For instance, Kolarova and Cherchi (2021) emphasize the significance of satisfaction with technology, specifically with advanced driver assistance systems, in enhancing trust and fostering a positive assessment of automated driving. Hence, our initial hypothesis is framed as follows: \nH2: Individuals who find their daily commutes monotonous and tiring are more likely to consider using Urban Air Taxis (UAT). Also, those who experience concerns about punctuality and have a higher level of time-related stress tend to favor UAT even more, with a more substantial influence on their preference for UAT than fatigue. The research suggests that an overall feeling of dissatisfaction with daily commute experiences increases the preference for UAT as an alternative mode of transportation. \n\nThe study's sample size comprises 507 individuals. The principal attributes of the participants in the dataset are documented in Table 2. It is noteworthy that the distribution of gender, employment status, and car availability situation aligns fairly well with the demographic statistics of the 2016 Census population of Tehran. \n\nThe age distribution of the sample corresponds well with the age distribution of Tehran. The largest age group of the sample is between 25 and 34 years old, with 28.01 % of the participants belonging to this group, followed by the 35–44 years old group at 22.29 \n%. On the other hand, the smallest age group is represented by participants over 65 years old, accounting for only 8.88 % of the sample. The gender distribution is almost equal, with males comprising 49.90 % of the participants and females accounting for 50.10 %, which is consistent with the census data. In terms of occupation, 54 % of the sample are employed, and the highest proportion belongs to housewives, accounting for 23.08 % of the sample. The difference in employment between the sample and census data can be explained by the fact that self-employed individuals are not included in the official employment in census data. For the education level, the majority of the participants hold a Bachelor's degree, representing 43.39 % of the sample, followed by high school diploma holders at 20.12 %. The most common household income class is equivalent to the public, with 53.65 % of the participants belonging to this group. \n\nIn relation to transportation behaviors, the most frequently utilized mode of transportation is the private car passenger, which comprises 40.04 % of the surveyed individuals, followed closely by public transport at 35.11 %.

{"doc_id": 182, "text": "Fig. 2 shows the choice of mode in each scenario within the study. The results indicate that the highest rate of adoption for UAT is observed in scenarios 3 and 8, where the cost of using UAT is equal to that of private cars and ride-hailing services (see Fig. 1). In contrast, the lowest share of UAT adoption is observed in scenarios 2 and 7, where the cost difference between UAT and other alternatives is the highest, notwithstanding that there exists a noticeable difference in travel time between UAT and the other two modes. \n\nThe use of Fig. 3 can facilitate a better comprehension of the present argument. For instance, an examination of graphs 1 and 2 reveals that the cost ratio is at its lowest in scenarios 3 and 8. However, these scenarios exhibit a high ratio of air taxi time to car (and in diagram 3, the ratio of air taxi time to ride-hailing) while simultaneously having the highest acceptance of air taxi. Conversely, scenario 2 and 7 exhibit the least acceptance, despite having a low time ratio (graphs 2 and 3). This is due to the high cost ratio (graph 1) associated with these scenarios. Thus, it can be inferred that the cost factor has a more pronounced influence on the adoption of UAT. \n\nThese observations suggest that the cost of using UAT plays a crucial role in the mode choice of individuals, and that a higher rate of adoption can be achieved when the cost of UAT is competitive with other modes of transportation. Kreimeier and Stumpf's (2017) \nresearch on consumer adoption in Germany yielded similar results, as they discovered that cost was a crucial factor in determining consumer adoption. \n\nThe assessment of travel satisfaction is primarily centered on cognitive or emotional evaluation of the trip (Singleton, 2019; De Vos et al., 2013). The questionnaire developed by Vahedi et al. (2021) to assess travel satisfaction comprises nine items that measure two emotional dimensions and one cognitive dimension. Respondents are asked to rate their emotional and cognitive experiences on a 7point Likert scale, ranging from a minimum or negative evaluation of − 3 to a maximum or positive evaluation of + 3. This scale has been used in previous research (Singleton, 2019; Ettema et al., 2010) and is commonly used to assess the emotional and cognitive dimensions of various constructs. Participants were instructed to choose the option that most accurately reflected their overall travel experience. This instruction was given in order to elicit an accurate representation of the participants' experiences and to provide \n\nThe results indicate that individuals who engage in walking and cycling consistently report heightened levels of enthusiasm. This finding aligns with the previous research conducted by De Vos (2019), which similarly identifies a strong correlation between walking, cycling, and elevated levels of travel satisfaction specifically related to the experience of excitement. Active mode users also experience more time relief compared to users of other modes of transportation, as they avoid congestion and the need to search for parking spaces. Additionally, incorporating physical activity into their daily routine can provide active mode users with a sense of well-being and reduce stress levels. Conversely, public transport users have reported the lowest levels of satisfaction attributes as expected (De Vos, 2019). Private car passengers perceive high levels of quality for their commute trips; however, private car drivers experience low levels of time relief due to traffic congestion and the need to search for parking spaces. \n\nThe strength of an individual's inclination towards a particular mode of travel is a significant determinant of their ultimate choice, and incorporating this variable into disaggregate choice models can significantly enhance their predictive validity ( Ben-Akiva et al.,\n199 ). The attitude towards a travel mode refers to the extent to which an individual evaluates or appraises a particular mode of transportation in a favorable or unfavorable manner ( De Vos et al., 2022 ). Attitudes towards travel modes can be assessed through survey instruments that inquire about the degree to which respondents associate positive attributes, such as relaxation, safety, and enjoyment, with the use of specific modes of transportation ( Kroesen et al., 2017 ; Karami et al., 2022 ; Samadzad et al., 2023 ).", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0965856423003051-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 183, "text": "The indicators devised to assess the corresponding attitude of individuals towards each mode were formulated utilizing the items employed by Kroesen and Chorus (2020) and Ton et al. (2020). To measure attitudes towards three modes of transportation: urban air taxis (UAT), private cars (PC), and ride-hailing (RH), we employed a survey instrument consisting of six items that assessed respondents' level of favorability towards each mode in terms of relaxation, safety, convenience, and environmental compatibility\n( Kroesen and Chorus, 2020 ). The survey items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (-2) to strongly agree\n(+2). This approach allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of attitudes towards each mode of transportation and provided a nuanced understanding of the factors that influence individuals' transportation choices.\n\nTable 3 shows the mean and standard deviation of the responses for each item regarding both travel satisfaction and attitudes\n\nFig. 6 serves as a comprehensive depiction of the distribution of responses encompassing individuals' attitudes towards travel modes. Specifically, it showcases the range of agreement or disagreement expressed by participants in response to a series of attitudinal statements pertaining to these modes of transportation. \n\nFig. 7 represents the level of agreement with positive attitudes towards UAT, ride-hailing, and private car among different existing travel mode users (the grades assigned indicate the extent of disagreement, with higher grades indicating more disagreement). The results indicate that private car drivers and cyclists displayed less disagreement towards UAT compared to private car passengers and walkers. Satisfaction with their current travel modes may be a valid justification. \n\nTable 4 presents the results of the exploratory factor analysis conducted on respondents' perceptions of satisfaction and attitudes towards travel. The analysis yielded three factors for each variable, which accounted for a cumulative variance of 68 % and 66 % of the total variance, respectively. Each factor explained more than 10 % of the total variance, which is considered an acceptable level of explanation according to Costello and Osborne (2005). \n\nAccording to Tabachnick and Fidell (2001) a minimum loading of 0.32 should generally be considered acceptable. However, \n\nCostello and Osborne (2005) suggest that if an item has several strong loaders (0.50 or better) on each factor, it should be dropped from the analysis. Therefore, in this study, items with loadings below 0.5 were excluded from the analysis. As a result, the item UAT_1 was dropped from the factor analysis due to its loading of 0.46. A satisfaction and attitude item (WR_3 and PC_6 respectively) was also omitted from the analysis due to inconsistency with the other factors and anticipated classifications. \n\nFinally, the results of structural equation models, employing ordinal logit models for latent variables are provided in Table 4. \n\nFollowing the application of factor analysis to the items, utilizing the Pandas Biogeme package (Bierlaire, 2020), a total of six latent variables were generated from the socio-demographic variables in an ordinal logit model. The outcomes of each latent structure are presented in Table 5. \n\nAccording to the results, 25–34 year-old women report less overall satisfaction with their travels, while 25–44 year old males report greater boredom on their regular journeys. Individuals within this age group are typically in a stage of life where they are juggling high levels of career and family responsibilities. Consequently, these individuals may experience increased levels of boredom during their regular commutes, as these trips may lack novelty or a sense of freedom. Job status and travel time are also determinant factors, in accordance with Smith (2013). Full-time employees, who often have more rigid work schedules, and individuals whose daily commute exceeds the average duration of one hour are more likely to experience boredom and exhaustion when commuting. Similarly, selfemployed individuals and students may feel more bored and exhausted during their commutes, which could be attributed to their youth. Individuals who work part-time jobs or are self-employed express greater concern regarding punctuality during their commute. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0965856423003051-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 184, "text": "The issue at hand may pertain to a potential difference in job security between part-time employees and their full-time counterparts, or the scheduling of important meetings. Conversely, high-income individuals tend to experience greater levels of enthusiasm and less boredom during their commutes. This is consistent with Ye and Titheridge (2019), who found lower travel satisfaction among lowincome individuals. This may be due to their increased flexibility in work schedules, greater financial resources to invest in transportation, and access to a broader range of transportation options. Finally, those who rely primarily on public transport as their mode of commute tend to experience higher levels of boredom and exhaustion. This aligns with Mao et al. (2016) who found the lowest levels of satisfaction among public transport users. This could be attributed to factors such as crowded conditions and a lack of control over their commute. They are also more concerned with being on time, a result of the unreliability of public transport travel times. Private car drivers and passengers, however, tend to perceive a higher level of cognitive quality in their travel experiences. This is similarly observed among individuals who utilize bicycles for their daily commute which is similar to the finding of Morris and Guerra (2014), \nwho found more satisfaction among private car and bicycle users compared to public transport. Despite the observed positive relationship between the use of bicycles and increased travel satisfaction, our findings do not necessarily align with the literature that suggests the highest level of satisfaction among bicycle users in comparison with other modes (Smith, 2013; Mao et al., 2016). \n\nThere is a generally favorable attitude towards the use of UAT, as indicated by the coefficient intercept for the ordinal logit model. \n\nAnalysis of the socio-demographic factors reveals that young males aged 18 to 24 exhibit a positive attitude towards UAT, whereas those aged 45 to 54 hold a negative attitude. Full-time employed individuals demonstrate a positive attitude towards UAT which is in contrast with housewives' attitude. Furthermore, those who have a high school diploma and belong to high-income groups display a positive attitude towards UAT, whereas individuals with average or low income exhibit unfavorable attitudes. Individuals who primarily use private cars or public transport exhibit a positive attitude towards UAT. Additionally, those whose average commute time ranges from 30 to 45 min express a positive attitude towards the use of UAT. \n\nSimilar to UAT, the individual's attitude towards using private cars is affected by various factors such as age, gender, income, education, job status, average trip length, and dominant mode for the commute. The model indicates that middle-aged females tend to exhibit negative attitudes toward using private cars. This could be attributed to their lower tolerance for traffic congestion and carrelated issues. On the other hand, individuals with higher incomes and those who travel long distances, more than an hour, exhibit more favorable attitudes towards using private cars. The former group may be better equipped to handle the costs of owning and operating a private car, which can explain this observation. Meanwhile, the latter group may find public transport inconvenient or uncomfortable, especially if their trip involves transfers or standing for extended periods. Private cars, in contrast, offer more comfort and convenience. The results of the model also suggest that private car users exhibit a positive attitude towards using this mode of transportation, confirming a positive correlation between attitudes and travel behavior (Ton et al., 2020). \n\nAccording to the model, it appears that females between the ages of 35–44 have a favorable attitude toward using ride-hailing services, possibly due to the convenience it offers as a mode of transportation. Lower-income individuals and undergraduates have shown unfavorable attitudes toward using ride-hailing. It is worth mentioning Lesteven and Samadzad (2019) suggesting that ridehailing use is less prevalent among these two groups of individuals. \n\nA multinomial logit model was developed to assess the impact of socio-demographic and latent variables on the adoption of UAT in the context of mode choice and the results are presented in Table 6. The modeling results indicate that socio-demographic variables, satisfaction with travel, and attitude towards travel modes are significant predictors of mode choice behavior.

{"doc_id": 185, "text": "The adoption of UATs over ride-hailing services is more prevalent among young males aged 25–34 and males aged 45–54. Males aged 18–24 have also shown a high propensity to use UAT. Middle-aged women aged 55–64, on the other hand, are less likely to use UATs. Age and gender are significant factors in the adoption of novel technologies. Younger individuals tend to be more tech-savvy and familiar with new technologies, which influences their adoption of UATs (Al Haddad et al., 2020). Conversely, women have been found to have a lower intention to use autonomous vehicles compared to men (Hohenberger et al., 2016). Additionally, individuals with higher incomes tend to prefer UATs over other modes of transportation. These findings are consistent with previous research by Fu et al. (2019) regarding the influence of age and income on UAT preference, as well as Castle et al. (2017) regarding the impact of age on UAT preference. Housewives exhibit lower adoption rates of UAT. Consistent with Castle et al. (2017) who indicated a greater preference for UAT among those with higher levels of education, our model demonstrates that individuals with bachelor's degrees exhibit a preference for UAT over private cars. This stands in contrast to the inclination of individuals who have not completed high school, as they exhibit a preference for private automobiles over the use of UAT. Self-employed individuals exhibit a preference for private cars and ride-hailing services, with a greater inclination towards the latter. This can be attributed to their relatively flexible schedules, which facilitate the use of ride-hailing services. \n\nThe findings of the study indicate that both satisfaction and attitudes play a significant role in the mode preference scenario that includes the option of using UAT among the available choices. The results suggest that individuals who experience greater levels of boredom during their daily commute exhibit a greater inclination towards utilizing UAT, as it provides a more enjoyable and entertaining travel experience (Al Haddad et al., 2020). The model's results suggest that individuals who perceive their daily commute to be boring and exhausting (STS_1) demonstrate a greater inclination towards utilizing UAT. Individuals who exhibit anxiety towards timeliness and possess a higher degree of time worry (STS_2) tend to display a preference for utilizing UAT, with an even higher impact on UAT utility compared to exhaustion. The study concludes that an overall sense of dissatisfaction with daily commute trips heightens the preference for UAT as an alternative. De Vos et al. (2022) found that a positive attitude towards a particular travel mode is positively associated with the preference for that mode in a mode choice scenario. This relationship is also confirmed by the model, indicating a favorable impact of the latent variable representing individuals' attitudes towards each travel mode on their corresponding mode preferences. The model shows that individuals who hold negative attitudes towards private cars and ride-hailing services are more likely to adopt UAM as a transportation mode. Compared to private car, negative attitudes towards ride-hailing have a more significant impact on the adoption of air taxis. \n\nThe value of time spent during in-vehicle travel for UAM, ride-hailing services, and private cars are estimated to be 782,000 tomans per hour (equivalent to 26.4 dollars per hour1), 170,000 tomans per hour (equivalent to 5.37 dollars per hour), and 148,000 tomans per hour (equivalent to 5.25 US dollars per hour), respectively. \n\nUrban Air Mobility (UAM) is being explored as a potential option for reducing travel times and addressing urban congestion, but its effectiveness and affordability remain subjects of ongoing research. While UAM holds promise in terms of potential benefits, it is important to note that the integration of UAM in urban mobility is currently in its nascent stages and requires further investigation. This is especially with regard to the dominance of conventional ground travel modes in urban mobility, particularly private cars. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0965856423003051-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 186, "text": "Consequently, the present study aims to investigate the adoption of UAM in urban mobility by integrating it into a mode choice scenario. Given the considerable significance of current satisfaction with trips and the attitude towards travel modes (De Vos, 2019; De Vos et al., 2022), this study is the first to investigate how these psychological factors impact the mode preference for UAM against two dominant ground travel modes, excluding public transport: private cars and ride-hailing. A survey was conducted to assess the UAM \nacceptance among the inhabitants of Tehran, a heavily populated metropolitan region in Iran. The questionnaire was developed and distributed to a sample of 507 individuals residing within the city. A hybrid multinomial logit choice model was employed to analyze the data, incorporating various socio-economic characteristics, psychological factors such as travel satisfaction and attitude, as well as travel time and cost. The study found that socio-demographic variables, namely gender, age, education, occupation, and income, as well as current mobility characteristics such as dominant commute mode and average daily commute time, exhibited significant influence on the mode preference of individuals. The findings indicate that socio-demographics play a crucial role in shaping latent attitudes and satisfaction. Additionally, the current mode of transportation may impact individuals' attitude towards air taxis, with private car and public transport users showing a positive attitude towards UAM. \n\nIn agreement with Hasan (2019), our findings also corroborate the significant role of affordability in the adoption of UAM. This is evidenced by two observations. Firstly, the only comparable level of UAM adoption in the eight scenarios analyzed was observed in those where the cost of urban air taxi was similar to that of ride-hailing and private cars. The adoption of UAT was also lowest in scenarios where the cost difference between UAT and conventional modes was highest, despite the significant time savings in those scenarios. Secondly, the cost coefficient had a significant impact on the disutility of UAT in mode choice modeling. Additionally, the modeling results evidently suggest that individuals with higher-than-average incomes are more likely to switch from private cars to UAM, which could exacerbate social equity issues. Therefore, policymakers must make a concerted effort to adjust the cost of UAM, as Cohen et al. (2021) have argued that negative community perceptions of UAM as a mode of transport for wealthy households to avoid traffic congestion is a major barrier to its adoption and integration. \n\nThe results confirm that, people's satisfaction with their daily travel can have an impact on their travel behavior (De Vos, 2019), \ndemonstrating that the adoption of UAM will be significantly impacted by the satisfaction with routine daily travels. This conclusion was supported by the identification of two components of satisfaction. Individuals who experience boredom during their daily commute and those who express concern regarding punctuality have exhibited a preference for utilizing UATs, with time concern having more impact on UAT preference. This may potentially dissuade individuals who utilize private car who have exhibited the greatest degree of time-consciousness and anxiety for delays during their routine commute. Nonetheless, it is possible that this may not be perceived as impressive to individuals who frequently engage in active modes of transportation, as they have demonstrated greater levels of enthusiasm towards their daily commutes and low levels of concern regarding delays. \n\nThe estimated value of time for UAM in Tehran, which is approximately 26.4 dollars per hour, aligns with Haan et al. (2021). Their study determined the value of time for UAM users in New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. to be 25.7 dollars per hour. However, in Munich, Fu et al. (2019) estimated a significantly higher value of total time at 55.0 dollars per hour. Conversely, Song et al. (2019) in Dallas and Los Angeles, and Ilahi et al. (2021) in Greater Jakarta estimated significantly lower value of time estimates. \n\nThese variations in value of time estimates can be attributed to both the methodology of stated preference surveys and the specific characteristics of each context. \n\nThe importance of individuals' attitudes towards the modes in question serves as a significant determinant of their decision to adopt UAT in their mode preference. Unfavorable attitudes towards the other two alternatives exert a substantial and noteworthy influence on augmenting the utility of UAT, with higher impact of unfavorable attitude towards ride-hailing. This can be attributed to the fact that even though ride-hailing offers benefits such as comfort, convenience, and time savings over private cars, individuals who hold unfavorable attitudes towards ride-hailing may be seeking a more optimal alternative to avoid ground congestion. Therefore, compared to private car, unfavorable attitudes towards ride-hailing may have a greater effect on the preference for UAT among the available choices. These observations serve as further evidence that holding unfavorable opinions regarding existing alternatives can enhance the demand and desirability of novel ones.

{"doc_id": 187, "text": "The study's empirical findings highlight the significance of establishing promotional strategies for UAT that respond to various user segments. By taking into account the psychological aspects of prospective users, such as their satisfaction levels with their current travels and their attitudes towards existing options, promotional strategies can be designed to accentuate the advantages of UAT over other alternatives, particularly private cars. The current transportation options available for daily commutes in congested urban areas such as Tehran have resulted in a significant level of dissatisfaction among individuals due to limited choices and various issues with commuting. Urban air mobility has appeared as a new mode of transportation with potential advantages when compared to conventional modes. As Bala´c et al. (2019) suggest, UAM may have a greater impact on transportation in heavily populated cities with congested ground traffic, compared to small cities like Zurich where its market share may be limited. However, the high cost associated with this mode of transportation can pose a challenge in Tehran, particularly considering the public's elevated cost sensitivity and the issue of social justice. Therefore, further research is necessary to determine the acceptable and affordable cost of urban air mobility services and to ensure their feasibility. \n\nAnalyzing the diversities in travel patterns among various demographic groups holds significant significance in the realm of public policy. This examination aids in the more effective allocation of limited resources to accommodate demand, ensures the satisfaction of travel requirements for individuals with limited mobility, and promotes the equitable distribution of policies among distinct population sectors and geographical regions (Garrow et al., 2021). Moreover, the study emphasizes the pivotal role of pricing in the adoption of UAM. Policymakers need to meticulously evaluate and, if necessary, modify the pricing of UAM services to ensure accessibility, taking into consideration the public's sensitivity to costs and concerns related to social equity. This may entail exploring options for financial assistance or innovative pricing structures. \n\nPolicy developers should formulate promotional strategies that consider the psychological aspects of potential UAM users, including their satisfaction with current travels and their attitudes toward existing alternatives. These strategies should highlight the merits of UAM, particularly when compared to private automobiles, as a means to mitigate dissatisfaction among commuters in densely populated urban areas. This could include designing messages and information campaigns about the vehicles, and it may involve marketing campaigns that focus on recommendations from trusted family and friends. In line with the insights from Shaheen et al. (2018), educational initiatives directed at the public can serve as a fundamental tool for introducing UAM as a viable transportation mode, particularly in regions with limited prior exposure to such technologies. These campaigns should focus on enhancing awareness and comprehension of UAM among the general populace. \n\nThis study has limitations that can provide valuable insights for future research endeavors. Firstly, our sample consisted of participants who had no prior exposure to UAM, and the questions regarding their inclination toward this transportation mode were framed as a hypothetical scenario. Despite providing respondents with comprehensive and precise information about UAM through the online survey, including textual and visual explanations, there is a possibility that their perceptions or preferences toward UAM may change when they actually engage with the system. The use of simulations or practical flight exposure in the context of UAM aircraft could potentially provide survey participants with a higher level of authenticity in understanding UAM travel (Shaheen et al., 2018). \n\nSecondly, the data collection methodology relied predominantly on self-reported responses obtained from the survey participants. \n\nThis approach is susceptible to biases such as social desirability bias and recall bias, which may influence the accuracy of the study's findings. Additionally, the study cohort was from a societal milieu with limited comprehension of the UAM ecosystem. While this is one of the only studies carried out on UAM in a developing country context, the application of our findings to alternative settings, particularly those marked by divergent socioeconomic characteristics and transportation infrastructures, requires prudence. \n\nWhile the study examined travel satisfaction and attitudes towards modal alternatives, it focused on only a subset of these variables. \n\nFuture research should consider a broader range of psychological factors that may influence UAM adoption. Additionally, while the study highlighted the time-saving and travel satisfaction benefits of UAM compared to other modes, it is important for future research to delve deeper into the realm of psychological factors, specifically environmental attitudes. This exploration is crucial for understanding the implications of UAM's advantages, particularly in relation to its adoption as an alternative to private cars. Variables such as noise pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, which have been identified as important factors in prior research (Mudumba et al., 2021), should be taken into account. Understanding and addressing the specific needs and attitudes of different user segments can play a significant role in driving UAM adoption. \n\nThis research presented a snapshot of UAM adoption preferences at this point in time, which may undergo changes over time, influenced by evolving societal attitudes, advancements in technology, or alterations in policy frameworks. Such changes can be subject for future research. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0965856423003051-main.md"}

We propose an iterative weighted k-means clustering method that incorporates the value of travel time of different transportation modes to identify potential vertiport locations. A multi-objective optimization model that maximizes total air taxi ridership and minimizes total facility costs and travel distances to vertiports is developed considering the constraints of the distance from vertiports to existing mobility hubs. A case study is conducted using the data of Beijing city, incorporating the modes of taxis and metro. We found that 19 vertiports can guarantee a robust performance of urban air mobility service. Users of urban air mobility can benefit from substantial travel time savings of 80% (48 min on average). This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the optimal setting of urban air mobility facilities from the perspective of network synchronization, offering useful insights into policy decision-making for sustainable infrastructure planning. \n\nTraffic congestion in metropolises has been a pervasive challenge that cast a shadow over citizens' daily routines and physical well-being \n(Nadrian et al., 2019, 2020). Recent discussions regarding the utilization of the third dimension in airspace have emerged, exploring alternative transportation modes capable of providing higher speed and punctual services (Wang and Qu, 2023). Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operates within the low-altitude airspace of urban areas and transcends the densely packed road networks, which alleviates the challenge of roadway congestion (Wang et al., 2023), thus contributing to sustainable transport. According to NASA's reports (Hasan, 2019; Reiche et al., \n2018) and the white paper launched by Uber Elevate (Holden and Goel, 2016), the advent of Urban Air Taxi (UAT) is anticipated to revolutionize urban transportation by transporting passengers via electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft around cities, producing less noise and fewer emissions (Karami et al., 2024). \n\nPractitioners (e.g., Uber, Boeing, Joby Aviation, Airbus, Volocopter, Lilium, Ehang, Skydrive, and others) and researchers have been actively engaged in the activities to explore the feasibility of deploying UAM, addressing a broad perspective of issues involving demand forecasting, infrastructure development, flight route planning, pricing strategies, \n\nEssentially, air taxi services comprise a multimodal process. Alongside the flying segment, a complete UAM journey must encompass ground transportation, facilitating travel from the origin point to the departure vertiport and from the arrival vertiport to the final destination (Rajendran and Zack, 2019). The proximity and accessibility during ground phases would exert a substantial impact on travel time and service quality, ultimately influencing the willingness of potential travelers to adopt UAM. Thus, it is imperative to determine the optimal vertiport locations to ensure the successful and efficient operation of air taxi services. This underscores that vertiport locations should be strategically positioned close to the demand points and transfer nodes between multimodalities, ensuring efficient transfers between UAM and ground transportation. \n\nIn this study, we propose a method to identify the optimal vertiport locations considering the integration of UAM in multimodal transportation networks. Differing from existing studies, the vertiport locations are determined as part of the multimodal transportation networks, connecting existing mobility hubs, i.e., airports, train stations, and metro transfer stations. We introduce a novel iterative weighted kmeans clustering approach that employs the value of travel time to account for the importance of various demand sources (e.g., taxis, buses, metro, cars, etc.) to identify the potential vertiport locations. A multiobjective optimization model is developed for maximizing the total air taxi ridership, minimizing total facility costs, and minimizing total travel distances to vertiports. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, a case study utilizing the data of taxis and metro in Beijing is carried out. \n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the literature on infrastructure development for UAM. Section 3 illustrates in detail the proposed method, including the weighted k-means clustering approach and multi-objective optimization model. Section 4 describes the case study conducted in the context of Beijing city, encompassing the detailed description and processing of the data.

{"doc_id": 192, "text": "Compared to ground transportation, research on UAM encompasses a wide array of crucial issues, such as public acceptance, demand estimation, infrastructure design, flight route planning, and potential competitiveness in comparison with other conventional transportation modes. A fundamental prerequisite is a comprehensive exploration of people's willingness to use UAM. The research found that, in general, potential UAM users are possibly people who are young (Fu et al., 2019), \npossess higher levels of education (Ilahi et al., 2021), and frequently engage with ride-hailing services and/or air travel services (Garrow et al., 2020). These findings offer useful insights to develop models of UAM demand forecasting. For instance, research has been conducted with an emphasis on the choice of urban air taxis in comparison with conventional cars and autonomous vehicles (Haan et al., 2021). An empirical finding shows that relative to ground taxi services, air taxis are capable of saving 50% in travel time and 16% in route length (Naser et al., 2021). \n\nIn addition to the perspective of competitors, researchers also conceptualize UAM as a supplement component of the existing urban transportation system, operating in a symbiotic manner rather than promoting competition (Fu et al., 2022). This is imperative, especially considering the synchronization of services offered by different transportation modes because a journey involving UAM can only be accomplished smoothly when the ground connection is efficient and reliable. \n\nThis necessitates further research regarding infrastructure development for the use of UAM, e.g., vertiports, and UAM traffic networks. \n\nBrunelli et al. (2023) conducted a systematic literature review concerning vertiport location and capacity issues, highlighting that vertiport location is more crucial than its number. As a key component supporting the take-off and landing of air taxis, existing facilities like helipads and airports have been proposed as potential vertiport sites to facilitate UAM operations (Willey and Salmon, 2021). However, the conversion costs associated with existing helipads are notably significant. More importantly, these facilities may not effectively match the travel demand of UAM considering the rapid service expansion. Therefore, researchers have explored the feasibility of three types of UAM-specific facilities, namely vertistops, vertiports, and vertihubs. These range from small-scale facilities to large-scale multifunctional facilities, utilizing diverse spaces, e.g., the rooftop of buildings, highway cloverleaf, and floating barges (Holden and Goel, 2016). \n\nTo assist UAM site selection, the number and location of vertiports are often determined according to certain optimization objectives, i.e., \nminimizing the number of vertiports or costs of infrastructures. While an expanded deployment of vertiports could exhibit the potential for travel time savings, the marginal benefits may be achieved only to a negligible extent. Studies generally recommend the initial construction of approximately 10–30 vertiports within major cities. Additionally, researchers have taken into account regional constraints and attempted to avoid restricted areas within the site selection framework, including residential zones, protected regions, among others (Wu and Zhang, 2021a). \n\nA key determinant of the infrastructure development is the predicted travel demand of UAM. Researchers often employ a threshold-based method to delineate and ascertain potential UAM demand. Specific benchmarks have been established, for instance, a minimum travel time requirement of 30 min (Yedavalli and Cohen, 2022) or a relative reduction in travel time by at least 40% compared to ground transportation (Holden and Goel, 2016). \n\nGiven UAM travel demand, site selection of vertiports becomes prominent. Fadhil et al. (2018) utilized GIS tools to investigate appropriate areas for UAM infrastructure, considering socio-economic variables, points of interest, major transport nodes, existing helipads, and noise. Wu and Zhang (2021a) developed a GIS-based UAM network design model to identify potential vertiport locations incorporating land use restrictions and UAM operational requirements. Subsequently, a deterministic integer programming model was employed to optimize candidate vertiport sites while considering the generalized travel costs and mode choices of users. Results from a case study in Tampa, Florida, show that users opting for UAM could benefit from significant time savings. \n\nTo determine the air travel demand, studies often identify the clusters based on the demand distribution through clustering algorithms, i.

{"doc_id": 193, "text": "The basic assumption underlying cluster-based identification is that the locations that are close to each other and have high travel demand can be treated as the locations of vertiports. However, these clusters do not necessarily entail particular places for vertiports. In particular, these clustered locations are isolated according to the planning goals. To find the feasible set of vertiports and their locations, objective-based approaches are needed to deal with the capacitated and/or uncapacitated hub location problem (HLP). \n\nChen et al. (2022) proposed an uncapacitated single-allocation p-hub median problem with the primary objective of minimizing the overall travel costs. They employed a grid-based variable neighborhood search heuristic algorithm to tackle this problem in the research area encompassed within the Fifth ring road of Beijing. However, this study overlooked the long-distance travel demands, i.e., possible trip points between the Fifth and Sixth ring roads in Beijing. Rath and Chow (2022) \nsuggested another two variants of the HLP to design the air taxi network considering consumer mode choice behavior and set up an optimization model with dual objectives i.e., maximizing air taxi ridership and air taxi revenue. Nonetheless, this analysis focused exclusively on airport-bound trips, potentially limiting its applicability in the expanding urban air taxi market. \n\nShin et al. (2022) introduced an innovative variant of the HLP that considered the potential collision risks. Their primary aim was to optimize the total costs, involving total travel costs, facility costs, and collision risk costs. Sells et al. (2021) presented both the uncapacitated facility location problem and the maximum coverage location problem based on the framework of the p-median facility location problem. They investigated the impact of UAM-aerodrome sitting on mode choice by employing a trip-effective cost model. In contrast to the facility location problem, the emphasis of the maximum coverage location problem lies in selecting locations that maximize the capture of anticipated demand. \n\nAdditionally, researchers have also addressed both capacitated and uncapacitated facility location problems. Venkatesh et al. (2020) proposed an optimization-based network model to ascertain the placement of vertiports for commuter boarding/de-boarding air metro in South Florida. The established optimization framework sought to concurrently minimize the total number of vertiports utilized to fulfill the network demand and the summed ground travel time to and from the vertiport facilities across the selected routes. In terms of the capacitated facility location problem, the amount of demand served by a given vertiport facility was also restricted by the commuting capacity of that facility. \n\nThese objective-based hub location problems provide useful methodological insights into vertiport site selection. \n\nTo obtain more reliable vertiport locations, a set of potential vertiport locations can be identified through clustering algorithms, and then a site location optimization model can be created. For instance, Holden and Goel (2016) employed the k-means algorithm to derive a candidate set of 100 potential vertiport locations, and then determined the optimal vertiport locations by maximizing trip coverage. \n\nTo further ascertain the locations and timings for developing UAM \nairports, Boo et al. (2023) introduced a multi-objective and multi-period location optimization model using an enhanced ε-constraint algorithm to explore the design of UAM service networks. The proposed model considered three objectives: maximizing passenger accessibility to UAM \nairports, minimizing the total land purchase cost, and minimizing the total aerial distance between airports. The accessibility only accounted for the distances from potential UAM airport locations to transportation hubs, sightseeing, and business points, overlooking additional possible demand points. The study did not consider the actual demand distribution to measure accessibility, thereby possibly resulting in a lower satisfaction rate of demand within the designed UAM network. Garrow et al. (2021) mentioned that air taxis necessitate integration with existing urban infrastructure, including other transportation modes, the electric grid, and the national airspace system, to provide faster connections and transform urban mobility. Brunelli et al. (2023) also argued that vertiports should be considered as an integral part of interconnected air-ground transportation systems to provide better accessibility and attract travel demand.

{"doc_id": 194, "text": "Due to the multimodality nature of UAM and the necessity to integrate UAM into existing mobility infrastructure, a method that properly identifies the optimal vertiport locations while synchronizing multimodal transportation is timely and necessary. To the best of our knowledge, however, this issue has not been addressed in the existing body of literature. Further insights are needed in this perspective to guide infrastructure development in alignment with the goal of urban sustainable development. In this regard, we propose a method to identify vertiport locations that are specifically integrated into the existing multimodal transportation networks. The approach utilizes an iterative weighted k-means clustering algorithm based on the concept of transportation network synchronization to observe the UAM demand in multimodal transportation. A multi-objective optimization model is then proposed to identify the optimal vertiport locations. The proposed method provides a generic framework for identifying the prospective vertiport locations considering multimodal transportation. \n\nAs previously mentioned, the utilization of urban air taxis involves several steps, delineated as follows: (1) booking an urban air taxi via an on-demand platform, encompassing different travel methods; (2) \nadopting ground transportation modes, such as metro, from origin to the departure vertiport; (3) boarding the air taxi at the departure vertiport and traveling to the arrival vertiport; (4) utilizing ground transportation modes again to reach the final destination from the arrival vertiport. \n\nConsidering the availability of multiple ground transportation alternatives, we aim to facilitate seamless connections between multimodalities. We introduce the concept of transportation network synchronization as a means to enhance vertiport accessibility and convenience. This entails placing a priority on integrating vertiport sites within existing mobility hubs, i.e., airports, train stations, and metro transfer stations. \n\nIn the following sections, we will present the methods to determine the optimal vertiport locations of air taxis. The method is composed of an iterative weighted k-means clustering algorithm to identify the potential vertiport locations and a multi-objective optimization model incorporating multimodal transportation systems to find the optimal vertiport. \n\nK-means clustering stands as a representative unsupervised learning algorithm within the domain of machine learning, which operates without the need for prior training data. It is particularly effective for clustering extensive datasets due to its simple and efficient procedure. kmeans treats all data equally and applies a uniform process during the clustering (Selim and Ismail, 1984), thereby being unable to differentiate the importance of distinct data features for the clustering and thus is unsuitable to handle categorical datasets. To address this limitation and account for the significance of various data features in clustering, weighted k-means clustering algorithms are considered promising (Chan et al., 2004). These algorithms employ indicators such as the βth power or entropy to constrain feature weights and enhance the clustering performance. \n\nLet X = {x1, x2, ⋯, xn} denote a set of multidimensional data points. \n\nWe aim to discover a partition C = {C1, C2, ⋯, Ck} that minimizes the squared Euclidean weighted distance between the cluster centroids and the data points contained within each cluster. Assuming μk represents the mean of the cluster Ck, the squared sum of the Euclidean distances from each data point to its corresponding centroid is calculated using Equation (1): \n\nIn the case of clustering the stopping points that are linked with multiple transportation modes, e.g., metro stations, and taxi drop-off. \n\nThus, the dataset of multimodal transportation comprises m categories, each representing a specific transportation mode, denoted as Xv = {xv1,xv2,⋯,xvn}. For each data category, a corresponding weight wv is associated, resulting in W = {w1, w2, ⋯, wm} for all transportation modes m. Thus, the total sum of squares across all clusters and all transportation modes is: \n\nBecause UAM is characterized by the high value of travel time (Fu et al., 2019), passengers utilizing travel methods with high VOTT are more inclined to shift to UAM. Conversely, travelers relying on the modes with low VOTT are less likely to opt for air taxis. In the clustering process, we aim to strategically position potential vertiports in closer proximity to people who exhibit a higher probability of transition toward air taxis. This means that the stopping points attached to a transportation mode with higher VOTT will be given a smaller weight to ensure that these points are closer to the potential vertiport.

{"doc_id": 195, "text": "The pseudocode for the proposed IKWC algorithm is presented. In the initial step, datasets for m transportation modes and the corresponding weight set associated with VOTT are inputted, and initial centroids are generated. In the second step, the algorithm iterates through all the datasets, associating each data point with its closest centroid. This step utilizes labels to identify data points of various transportation modes and assigns corresponding weights to compute the Euclidean weighted distance. The third step involves repeating the assignment and update process until assignments cease to change, indicating convergence and stable clustering results. Algorithm 1. Iterative weighted k-means clustering algorithm \n\nA notable issue of the k-means clustering algorithms lies in the necessity to predefine the number of clusters. The silhouette coefficient offers a solution for the determination of the optimal number of clusters for k-means and for assessing the performance of the clustering results (Rousseeuw, 1987). The silhouette coefficient serves as an internal evaluation metric, quantifying the distances between each observation point and others within the same cluster, as well as the distances to observation points in other clusters. The silhouette coefficient of the i point xi is as follows: \n\nFig. 1. Travel structure of multimodal air taxi service. \n\nCl = argminCk\n1\n|Ck|\n∑\npjϵCk\n$$\\beth\\prod_{i\\in{\\mathbb{N}}}\\vert\\vert p_{i}-x_{i}\\vert\\vert^{2}$$\n2\n(5) \n$\\mathfrak{wf}$. \n$$\\Phi_{\\mathrm{re}}$$\nwhere pj represents the j observation point within the cluster Ck. \n\nFollowing the computation of the silhouette coefficient for all observations, averaging them yields the mean silhouette coefficient. The mean silhouette coefficient ranges between − 1 and +1, with a value closer to 1 indicating a strong fit of the observation point within its cluster and a lower fit to other clusters. Generally, the value of the silhouette coefficient exceeding 0.5 suggests better clustering quality (Manghat and Krishnamurthy, 2020). By calculating the silhouette coefficient for various k values, the optimal number of clusters can be determined by selecting the k value that corresponds to the highest value of the silhouette coefficient. 3.2. *Multi-objective optimization model* 3.2.1. *Problem formulation* From a market share point of view, ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential travel demand points in the selection of vertiport locations is equivalent to the concerns of having the maximum ridership of air taxis. However, building as many as possible vertiports in urban areas would be treated as financially infeasible because the construction and operational costs of these facilities are often expensive. In addition \n\nThe model is subject to a set of constraint conditions. Constraint (9) \nensures that the distance *ljh* between selected vertiports and existing mobility hubs must be within a certain threshold r. In an ideal scenario, this restricted distance would be zero, signifying that the vertiports are located within or on the rooftops of existing mobility hubs, facilitating seamless transfers either horizontally or internally. However, practical conditions may hinder this ideal configuration, the distance is constrained within a specified threshold to enhance the accessibility to vertiports. Constraint (10) is an important constraint because it warrants that each demand point is connected to a vertiport. Constraint (11) guarantees that the vertiport connected to a demand point is among the selected vertiports. Lastly, constraint (12) ensures that the demand of each point is served by the selected vertiports. \n\nFor each objective function, a decision variable is defined, namely xij, yj, and zij. \n\nThe case study is carried out in Beijing, China. With its 16 districts spanning a vast area of 16,410.54 square kilometers, Beijing stands as one of the largest cities in China. According to the 2023 Beijing Commuting Characteristics Annual Report, the average commuting time in the central urban areas is about 51 min in which 31% of the commuting trips take 60 min or longer. The average commuting distance is 13.2 km. Long-distance commuting via ground transportation exacerbates traffic congestion within the city, thereby highlighting the significant potential for urban air taxis. \n\nAccording to the 2023 Beijing Transportation Development Annual Report, metro ridership constitutes 42.48% of the total urban ridership, followed by buses at 36.04%, bikes at 18.21%, and taxis at 3.25%.

The population residing within this area constitutes 76.7% of the urban total population, while the employment opportunities within this zone make up 79.1% of the total. In light of this, we define the study area as a rectangular region measuring 54 km in length and width, as depicted in Fig. 2. \n\nDue to multimodality and data availability, we consider two transportation modes: taxi and metro. Taxi data has been popularly applied in UAM analysis as taxi users are typically considered the most prospective UAM users. The metro system in Beijing covers almost all the main areas, providing convenient public transport services. The transition from the \n\nIn addition to road network data from Open Street Map (OpenStreetMap, 2023), the taxi and metro data were used. The taxi data was obtained from an open T-Drive trajectory dataset released by Microsoft Research Asia that includes detailed GPS trajectories of 10,357 taxis operating in Beijing during one week, from February 2–8, 2008 (Yuan et al., 2010). This dataset consists of approximately 15 million pieces of points and covers the distance of trajectories of more than 9 million kilometers. Each record in the dataset contains a unique taxi ID, date, time, longitude, and latitude. \n\nWe generated trip data for each taxi encompassing pickup and dropoff points according to two rules. Firstly, when time is progressing and the position is changing, we consider that the trajectory is recorded as moving. Secondly, when time is advancing but the position information remains constant, we identify that position as the drop-off point of the current trip and the pickup point of the next trip. Ultimately, a total of 803,896 rows of taxi trip data were extracted. However, some points are located outside the research area and thus were excluded. Moreover, a maximum of 5 h of travel time was used as a criterion to select the data considering that taxi travel times typically range from 5 min to 5 h \n(Xiong et al., 2021). This means the data having a duration shorter than 5 min or longer than 5 h were filtered out. In the end, a total of 285,424 valid taxi travel records remained. \n\nFurthermore, we treat taxi trips longer than 5 km as the potential demand for air taxis. Trips having a distance shorter than 5 km were also \n\nY. Zhao and T. Feng\n\nThe metro OD matrix data has station names that are not geocodingfree. Thus, we perform a geocoding process to generate the coordinates for each origin and destination point. It is also found that three metro stations lie outside the boundaries of the Sixth Ring Road, thus exceeding the scope of the study area. Those data were thus eliminated. \n\nConsequently, any trips with a starting station or a destination station outside the designated area were excluded from the dataset. Following the data cleansing procedure, we obtained a refined subset consisting of 346,589 metro trips that were entirely confined within the study area. \n\nTo obtain air travel demand, we consider the metro trips that are longer than 10 km, and as such, we obtained a subset of 286,922 metro trips. Fig. 4 presents the geographical distribution of the origin and destination points for this subset. It is worth mentioning that since both the origin and destination points correspond to metro stations, the \n\nIn this section, we first present the results of the potential travel demand of air taxis that was obtained through the proposed iterative weighted clustering algorithm. Then, we discuss the results of optimized vertiport locations obtained via the multi-objective optimization model. To ascertain a deeper understanding of the impacts on the quantity and spatial placement of vertiports, we perform a sensitivity analysis by altering the parameters, including the k value in the clustering algorithm, the service radius searching the vertiport, and the distance constraint from vertiports to the nearest existing mobility hubs.

{"doc_id": 197, "text": "Drawing upon the study conducted by Kou et al. (2017), we adopted a value of 11.34 yuan/hour as the VOTT for the metro and 17.81 yuan/hour for taxis. The VOTT for taxis surpasses that of the metro, which approximates that taxi consumers are more inclined to switch towards air taxis. During the clustering process, we aim to position centroids closer to demand points associated with taxis. Hence, when computing the distance between each taxi-related demand point and the centroid, we employ the Euclidean weighted distance formula to obtain a smaller distance. In other words, demand points tied to the metro will exhibit a greater separation from the centroid. Taking this into account, when calculating the distance between the metro-related demand point and the centroid, we assign a weight of *wmetro* = 17.81 /11.34. Similarly, for the calculation of the distance between the taxi-related demand point and the centroid, a weight of *wtaxi* = 1 is assigned. Given the weight for metro surpasses 1, demand points linked to metro are consequently distanced further from the centroid. We incorporate the weight set W =\n{wtaxi, *wmetro*} into Equation (3) and Algorithm 1 to facilitate subsequent computation. \n\nAs expounded in the literature, it is generally advisable to establish an approximate range of 10–30 vertiports within urban settings. Hence, the number of candidate vertiports derived from the clustering process should not fall below 30. Moreover, the research framework of this study is based on transportation network synchronization, wherein the subsequent optimization process entails the selection of vertiports in closer proximity to existing mobility hubs. We sort out 118 primary transportation hubs in Beijing, encompassing airports, train stations, and metro transfer stations. We contend that these mobility hubs cater to a significant volume of travel demands. Consequently, during the clustering procedure, employing an incremental value of 1, the k value was initialized at 30 and iteratively increased up until reaching 118. The clustering results for k values of 30, 35, 40, and 45 are presented in Fig. 5. \n\nTo assess the effectiveness of clustering and ascertain the optimal value of k, we conducted calculations for the silhouette coefficients across a range of k values, from 30 to 118 (increment by 1). The silhouette coefficients corresponding to different k values are presented in Fig. 6. A silhouette coefficient surpassing 0.5 indicates a higher quality of clustering. From the result, we can see silhouette coefficients exceeding 0.5 are predominantly observed when k surpasses 95. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that higher values of k yield superior clustering \n\nTherefore, the optimal k value is found to be 103. \n\nThrough the application of IWKC, we derived a candidate set consisting of 103 potential vertiports. The spatial distribution of these vertiports is represented in Fig. 7. It demonstrates a denser concentration within the boundaries of the Fifth Ring Road. Between the Fifth Ring Road and the Sixth Ring Road, the dispersion becomes sparser and distributed along specific roadways. The distribution of the candidate vertiports reveals the main transportation corridors. \n\nWithin the study area, a total of 118 mobility hubs exist in Beijing, comprising airports, train stations, and metro transfer stations. The geographical spatial distribution of these existing mobility hubs is illustrated in Fig. 8. It can be seen that metro transfer stations are densely concentrated within the confines of the Fifth Ring Road. Train stations predominantly occupy the region spanning between the Fifth Ring Road and the Sixth Ring Road, exhibiting a comparatively sparse dispersion. This observed distributional pattern is intimately linked to the distinctive service characteristics intrinsic to each respective transportation method. \n\nThe rationale behind selecting airports, train stations, and metro transfer stations stems from our conviction that these pivotal nodes encounter substantial service demands, indicative of a corresponding substantial requirement for the air taxi market either. Furthermore, it is anticipated that these hubs will be surrounded by interconnected bus stops or bike-sharing parking areas, obviating the necessity to select additional hubs of other transportation modes. By seamlessly integrating the vertiports within the proximity of these hubs, it establishes seamless linkages between vertiports and metro, buses, and shared bicycles, thereby attaining a seamless integration within the multimodal transportation system. Drawing upon the estimation values of installation cost and operational cost for the vertiport by Holden and Goel (2016), Shin et al. \n\nIt can be seen that 12 vertiports are positioned within the confines of the Fourth Ring Road, while no vertiports are found between the Fourth Ring Road and the Fifth Ring Road. However, the vertiports located at the edge of the Fourth Ring Road might cover the travel needs in that area. Furthermore, six vertiports are distributed amidst the Fifth Ring ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0959652624024375-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 198, "text": "Road and the Sixth Ring Road, with three of them positioned between the Northern Fifth Ring Road and the Northern Sixth Ring Road. This aligns with the actual distribution of travel patterns in Beijing where the travel demand within this region is greater than in the other three directions. Significantly, a distinct vertiport is situated amidst Beijing Capital International Airport and Shunyi Train Station. \n\nTo further analyze the impacts of the selected vertiports on air trips, we obtain the percentage of potential air trips covered within a 3-km service radius of the selected vertiports, as well as the average percentage of travel time savings. To estimate the travel time for the original metro trips, we employed the average travel speed of the Beijing metro system, which stands at 36.8 km/h. It is crucial to emphasize that the travel time for multimodal air taxi trips consists of three segments, namely one flying segment and two on-road segments. Given that the selected vertiports are seamlessly integrated within the multimodal transportation framework, we assume that metro and taxi users engage in metro transfers for on-road segments when transitioning to air taxis. \n\nFurthermore, we also assumed that the origin and destination points of the passengers are near a certain metro station, neglecting the access time to metro stations. In addition, the cruising speed of air taxis is set to be 160 km/h empirically. By computing the original travel time and the transformed travel time for potential air trips covered by the vertiports, we derived the average travel time savings. The parameters utilized in the calculations and the resultant values are shown in Table 1. \n\nIt can be found that the aforementioned 19 vertiports effectively cover 80.37% of the demand points within a 3-km service radius. This \n\nIn this section, we investigate the impact on vertiport placement and the resultant travel time savings by varying the values of three parameters: the k value of the clustering, the service radius of the vertiports, and the distance constraint to existing mobility hubs. \n\nWe can observe from the table that as the clustering performance \n\nWe found that, when the clustering results work better (e.g., when k equals 103 or 96), the selected vertiport locations exhibit relatively uniform distribution. Conversely, suboptimal clustering outcomes may result in the absence of vertiports facilitating air taxi services in some important regions. For instance, when the k-value is 116, there is a lack of vertiports located in the southern suburban area. Similarly, when the k-value is 114, there is a shortage of serviceable vertiports within the proximity of the Beijing Capital International Airport. \n\nA notable correlation can be detected between the expansion of the service radius and the coverage of both demand points and potential air trips. For instance, as the service radius expands from 2 km to 5 km, the proportion of covered demand points undergoes a substantial increase, surging from 65.14% to 88.34%. Similarly, there is a corresponding \n\nIntriguingly, despite this pronounced increase, the impact on the number of vertiports is comparatively minor, with only one additional vertiport being incorporated. Moreover, despite the modest increase of only one vertiport, the two metrics related to time savings remain optimal in the scenario featuring 19 vertiports. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that, as the service radius expands, passengers traverse longer distances, which is detrimental to travel time savings. To gain further insights into these findings, we depict the geographical distribution of the vertiports for varying service radius. \n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 11, when the service radius of vertiports is set to 2 km, numerous densely distributed demand points in the city center remain uncovered. However, expanding the service radius to 3 km enables the effective coverage of a majority of demand points within the Fourth Ring Road. Conversely, as the service radius exceeds 3 km, the coverage areas of the vertiports begin to overlap, which is detrimental to the actual service performance. This observation substantiates that a 3km service radius and 19 vertiports can ensure the robust performance of urban air mobility networks. \n\nThe table reveals that, as the distance constraint to existing mobility hubs increases, the number of selected vertiports undergoes a significant rise. Particularly, when the distance constraint is extended from 0.5 km to 2 km, the number of selected vertiports increases from 12 to 20, nearly doubling in quantity. This expansion aligns with a proportional escalation in the coverage of demand points, with the proportion rising from 60.07% to 81.94%. Similarly, there is a substantial surge in the proportion of potential air trips served, experiencing an impressive surge from 36.20% to 71.16%. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0959652624024375-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 199, "text": "Furthermore, it is noteworthy that as the distance constraint progressively increases from 0.5 km to 1 km, the indicators regarding travel time savings increase concurrently. However, once the distance threshold exceeds 1 km, the increasing trend of travel time savings becomes marginal. It is important to note that an excessively long-distance constraint is unfavorable for promoting intermodal transfers, e.g., change from/to public transport. Hence, a distance of 1 km between vertiports and existing mobility hubs is considered feasible. \n\nFig. 12 visualizes the spatial distribution of vertiports under varying distance thresholds. As illustrated, when enforcing a particularly stringent distance constraint of 0.5 km from vertiports to existing mobility hubs, only three vertiports are identified beyond the confines of the Fourth Ring Road. This would hardly satisfy the travel demands of longdistance travelers residing in the southern and northern suburban areas. Furthermore, there are no vertiports in proximity to Beijing Capital International Airport either. Nonetheless, by relaxing the distance constraint to exceed 1 km, we identify one vertiport near the airport, one vertiport situated within the southern suburban region, and two vertiports in the northern suburban prosperous zone. These vertiports are considered to effectively cater to the travel needs of long-distance travelers from that vicinity. \n\nDrawing upon the above analysis, we recommend that the infrastructure planning for air taxi services in Beijing entails the establishment of 19 vertiports. Such an infrastructure configuration is capable of catering to the needs of over 60% of potential air trips, leading to 80% of travel time savings (an average of 48 min saved). This finding is comparable with existing studies. Rajendran and Zack (2019) found that at least 50% travel time saving can be achieved through the deployment of UAM infrastructure. Furthermore, Wu and Zhang (2021a) and Ribeiro et al. (2023) anticipated that employing UAM services could result in 8–40 min and 18.5–63 min time savings, respectively. \n\nDifferent from Pukhova et al. (2021) who treated car and UAM \nindependently, we attempt to synchronize transportation networks to facilitate the utilization of multimodal air taxi services. On one hand, integrating vertiports into existing mobility hubs provides potential users with a plethora of transfer alternatives beyond just cars. On the other hand, the integration encourages the adoption of sustainable transfer modes, such as public transport. These aspects substantiate the potential of our proposed UAM site selection framework in alleviating road congestion, reducing emissions, and promoting sustainable urban transportation. \n\nTo incorporate the feasibility issue related to airspace restrictions that have been popularly applied in many cities, we examined the UAM network deployment scheme by adding this constraint into the model. \n\nAs depicted in Fig. 13, the area within the Second Ring Road is designated as the restricted zone where vertiport placement is not permitted. \n\nBy excluding candidate locations within the restricted area and solving the optimization model, 17 vertiport sites were identified. Such a configuration is capable of servicing 51.65% of potential air trips and can save 79.76% of the travel time (about 47.9 min on average). \n\nThe advantages of UAM services operated by eVTOL aircraft might benefit environmental conservation through improved travel efficiency, aligning with the concept of sustainable transportation. This paper introduces a UAM-based multimodal transportation system that promotes the creation of integrated and synchronized transportation services that offer seamless transfers between air taxis and other ground transportation modes. The concept could potentially maximize the benefits of time savings and contribute to the environment. \n\nTo systematically identify the optimal infrastructure locations for air taxis, we introduced an iterative weighted k-means clustering technique that employs the value of travel time as clustering weights, where a candidate set of potential vertiport locations is derived. Furthermore, leveraging the concept of transportation network synchronization, a multi-objective optimization model was formulated to identify the optimal vertiport locations with the objectives of maximizing total air taxi ridership, minimizing overall facility costs, and minimizing transfer distances to vertiports, under the constraints of service radius of vertiports and distance to existing mobility hubs.

{"doc_id": 200, "text": "The findings through a case study share valuable insights for policymakers into developing comprehensive urban aerial transportation networks. We found 19-vertiport configuration can ensure a robust performance for the air taxi service in Beijing. Users of air taxis can benefit from substantial travel time savings of 80% (48 min on average). Although augmenting the number of vertiports may enhance the service capacity of UAM, the sensitivity analysis reveals that the extent of enhancement is marginal and the changes in travel time savings are nearly negligible once the number of vertiports surpasses 19. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the service radius of vertiports does not significantly affect the quantity and placement of vertiports. However, the distance constraints to existing mobility hubs have a notable impact on the selection and positioning of vertiports. \n\nThe site selection framework proposed in this study holds promises to build seamless door-to-door air taxi services for long-haul travelers, promoting sustainable travel styles and facilitating seamless connectivity across transportation modes. The study, however, also exhibits limitations. The case study considered two transportation modes while our proposed research method is generic in the sense that future studies could expand it by including more transportation modes and/or using the latest dataset. Furthermore, the site selection problem may be restricted by the capacity constraints of mobility hubs and/or vertiports, e.g., physical and/or service capacity, especially when excessive congestion needs to be avoided. Methodologically, this would mean the optimization model needs to be expanded by including capacity constraints, which might add additional complexity to the optimization problem. \n\nMoreover, the current study emphasized the strategic level of vertiport location selections by formulating the accessibility measurement using distance. However, one may argue the use of a generalized cost function could be an alternative accessibility criterion, especially in the need to incorporate dynamic traffic situations. This would result in a further model extension incorporating traffic dynamics into multimodal networks. We consider the aspects mentioned above to be worth investigating in the future such that the traffic congestion issue within the site selection process can be treated more comprehensively. \n\nYing Zhao: Writing - original draft, Visualization, Validation, Software, Resources, Project administration, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization. **Tao Feng:** Writing - \nreview & editing, Validation, Supervision, Resources, Project administration, Methodology, Data curation, Conceptualization. \n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\nData will be made available on request. \n\nWe would like to thank the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan to provide the MEXT scholarship for this research. \n\nBoeing, G., 2017.

(2023) in Iran, all report generally favorable attitudes towards the new mode of transportation, constantly on the rise (Tepylo et al., 2023; Park et al., 2022), even though concerns about its safety\n(Ahmed et al., 2023; Ilahi et al., 2021; EASA, 2021; Al Haddad et al.,\n2020), security (Ilahi et al., 2021; EASA, 2021), and noise pollution\n(EASA, 2021) still need to be addressed. Meanwhile, the rapid technological development of autonomous vehicles has contributed to familiarizing society with delegating control to autonomous systems\n(Bjørnskau et al., 2023; Garrow et al., 2021).\n\nThe idea of an intracity air taxi is not totally new. In fact, several ondemand helicopter-hailing companies worldwide have been providing air taxi services for business or aerial sightseeing purposes in Australia\n(Microflite, 2023), in Japan (Hiratagakuen, 2023), as well as in S˜ao Paulo, Mexico City, and San Francisco Bay Area (Acubed, 2020). However, for widespread use of UAM, people should still be introduced to this technologically advanced mode of transportation (Ilahi et al., 2021).\n\nIt is a common characteristic of new technologies that the more individuals are aware of their benefits, the more they will trust and use them (Deloitte, 2017).\n\nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\n\nARTICLE INFO\n* Corresponding author.\n\nE-mail *address:* msamadzad@ut.ac.ir (M. Samadzad).\n\nM.  et al.\n\nElectric passenger drones are expected to start commercial service as early as 2024. For instance, the city of Paris has expressed its intention to provide air taxi services during the 2024 Olympic Games (Hader et al.,\n2020). However, the actual success of this mode relies on the involvement of state and local governments, along with other stakeholders who will invest in the infrastructure development (PwC, 2023; Wisk Aero, 2023). Meanwhile, it is prudent to focus on targeted markets where the implementation of UAM is deemed viable. As Straubinger et al. (2020)\npointed out, it is not realistic to consider UAM as a mass transit service. This assertion is especially relevant to developing country contexts where widespread adoption of an expensive mode of transportation is not yet a tenable assumption. Nevertheless, niche segments can be identified where a successful implementation may be quite within reach.\n\nThis paper aims to characterize the prospective demand for UAM in Iran. It contributes to the emerging literature by suggesting that UAM should not be viewed as a comprehensive solution to the problem of congestion or a way to achieve sustainable urban transportation but rather as an option to curb chronic urban congestion for specifically targeted demand segments. It aims to address the fundamental question of whether passengers would utilize air taxis (Straubinger and Rothfeld, 2018), assuming that they are available along with the existing modes (Fu et al., 2019). In this perspective, we consider three niche markets of weekly business trips, airport access trips, and tourism trips, and propose to characterize the corresponding demand in the developing country context of Iran by conducting three independent stated preference surveys.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 presents a review of the literature on UAM. Section 3 discusses the research methodology and the survey design. Case studies are introduced in Section 4, and statistical analyses and modeling results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 discusses the main findings, and Section 7 highlights implications, limitations of the study, and directions for future research.\n\nIlahi et al. (2021) used data from a combined revealed and stated preferences survey in Greater Jakarta that included UAM as an emerging mode in the choice set. They concluded that UAM is potentially suitable for affluent residents over long-distance trips and suggested that it may find practical use for accessing satellite cities or the airport within the Greater Jakarta metropolitan area as a means to curb congestion. Ahmed et al. (2021) found that the willingness to hire and pay for flying taxi services is significantly influenced by socio-demographic factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, education, and income levels. They pointed out that older respondents are generally unwilling to pay more than current Uber/Lyft rates for an air taxi trip and women are more likely to use human-operated flying taxis. Rajendran and Srinivas (2020) highlighted the importance of public perception factors such as safety and long-distance commuting preferences for demand estimation.

{"doc_id": 205, "text": "Fu et al. (2019) presented results from a stated preferences survey for regular commuting and non-commuting purposes in Munich. They estimated the air taxi value of time equal to €44.7 per hour, nearly 60%\nmore than the private car and 40% more than the autonomous ground taxi, and indicated that UAM is more relevant to occasional trips rather than daily commutes primarily due to its high fares. This viewpoint is also shared by Reiche et al. (2018) who showed that UAM users prefer to share autonomous vehicles for long-distance recreational trips and airport access and concluded that lowering the cost is the most effective incentive for increasing UAM use. Ahmed et al. (2023) argued that the viability of UAM services is closely tied to keeping operational costs competitive with conventional transportation options. Kalakou et al.\n\nSun et al. (2018) found that, in the presence of fast and comfortable railway services, UAM cannot acquire a competitive advantage in interurban travel time, while its competitiveness highly depends on the region as well.\n\nWhile there is a trend in the literature to draw parallels between UAM and autonomous ground vehicles due to their similarities from an emerging technology standpoint, there are also significant differences that should be considered. Al Haddad et al. (2020) highlighted that socio-demographic characteristics, safety concerns, data and ethical concerns, and the value of time play important roles in UAM adoption, while Merat et al. (2017) found that reliability and safety are the main factors influencing the use of shared autonomous vehicles, followed by availability, performance in weather conditions, and ease of access. One should note that safety and autonomy manifest themselves in completely different ways in the UAM and autonomous vehicle contexts.\n\nFor instance, Deloitte (2017) observed that German drivers overwhelmingly prefer to be able to intervene and take control of their autonomous ground vehicle at any time, a provision that cannot be afforded at all in the UAM context.\n\nUAM is found to be more attractive to high-income households\n(Straubinger et al., 2021b; Ilahi et al., 2021; Binder et al., 2018), at least in the short run. Ahmed et al. (2021) found that high-income households exhibit a higher willingness to pay a premium for flying taxis and individuals with a college degree are also more likely to use these services.\n\nCohen et al. (2021) enumerated four major challenges to UAM acceptance, including (1) noise, visual pollution, and privacy for flights over residential land uses, (2) social equity as UAM is a costly mode of transport, (3) personal safety, and (4) operational safety and security. In particular, social equity plays an important role in the community acceptance of UAM, as low-income individuals are almost unable to use this mode of transport. Uber estimated a kickoff price of about $5 per passenger mile, which they predicted will decrease tenfold in the long run (Binder et al., 2018) as a result of achieving economies of scale (Reiche et al., 2018). This is compatible with the willingness to pay reported by Kreimeier et al. (2018) in Germany, ranging from €0.5 to\n€0.8 per kilometer. Rimjha et al. (2021a) studied the demand for UAM as a mode of access to the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Dallas Love Field Airport, distinguishing between business and non-business trips made by visiting and resident travelers. In the case of the business trips by visitors and residents, they estimated the value of time equal to $57.5 per hour and $56.5 per hour, respectively, while the estimates were significantly lower at $36.4 per hour and $32.5 per hour, respectively, for non-business trips. Using data from Dallas and Los Angeles, Song et al. (2019) examined several model specifications yielding different value-of-time estimates approximating $26.0, $20.7, and $34.5 per hour for access, flight, and egress portions of an air taxi trip. Meanwhile, using data from New York and Los Angeles, Haan et al.\n\nM.  et al.\n\nAir taxi services are expected to become operational in the near future, however, they are not currently available. Therefore, stated preferences surveys are the main tools for acquiring insight into the behavior of the individuals regarding air taxi use. In this study, three stated preferences surveys corresponding to the three aforementioned weekly business, airport access, and tourism trip purposes are designed and conducted independently. Each survey incorporates a number of existing modes of transportation, and the air taxi as the emerging mode. Descriptive statistics and discrete choice modeling are employed to infer the relevant preferences of the respondents.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0969699724001017-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 206, "text": "Three separate questionnaires were designed to capture preferences for air taxi use across three different trip purposes, including weekly business, airport access, and tourism. Each questionnaire was structured in four sections. The questions were similar among the three questionnaires except for the mode choice scenarios, which were appropriated for the corresponding trip purposes. The first section inquired about sociodemographic characteristics such as age, education, employment, gender, income, and the number of available cars in the household, as well as respondents' regular habits, such as their common mode of transportation and the time they usually spent on social networks. In the second section, Likert-type statements were included to inquire about respondents' opinions regarding environmental concerns, use of private vehicles, availability of a car parking area, practice of trip sharing, and use of driving assistance systems.\n\nIn the third section, air taxis were introduced as shared mobility services operated by automated electrically-powered vertical take-off and landing aircraft with the capacity for four passengers traveling at a speed of 150–200 km per hour in the urban low-altitude airspace. They were advertised as less noisy and more comfortable than regular helicopters. An illustration was also provided to help visualize a trip on board an air taxi. Following the brief introduction, a series of six scenarios specific to each trip purpose was presented to the respondents, who were asked to choose their preferred mode for the questionnaire's corresponding trip purpose. For weekly business and airport access trip purposes, four modes of transportation, including private cars, public transport, air taxis, and ride-hailing taxis, were considered. For tourism trips, public transport was excluded. Each mode of transport was characterized by three attributes, including travel time, total travel cost, and waiting/walking time, chosen from the values provided in Table 1. Respondents who did not choose an air taxi in any of the six scenarios were asked an extra question inquiring about the most effective incentive that would persuade them to use air taxis.\n\nIn the last section of the questionnaire, Likert-type statements were included to inquire about respondents' concerns about safety, the use of new \"unproven\" technology, and privacy.\n\nIt should be noted that the three surveys were conducted independently, and the respondents participating in each survey were random individuals who were not necessarily aware of the other surveys. Each respondent was presented with a contextual introductory statement explaining what an Urban Air Taxi is and what the scenarios are. Then, they were asked to choose their preferred mode in each scenario. Participants were not required to be currently engaged in tourism, airport access, or weekly commute activities to participate in the survey. They were simply requested to have prior experience with these types of trips, ensuring their familiarity with the subject matter.\n\nTwo model specifications are considered. The multinomial logit model, with the assumption of independence among alternatives, provides the baseline. However, since urban air taxi is a new mode with which people do not have real-world experience, following Bierlaire et al. (2001), we suggest testing a similarity structure among existing modes, reflecting respondents' familiarity with them as opposed to the future mode. To do so, a nested logit model specification depicted in Fig. 1 is used.\n\nA nesting parameter that deviates significantly from unity indicates a correlation between existing modes, suggesting that respondents perceive them as somewhat similar. While this does not rule out the possibility of other meaningful nesting structures, our focus is on identifying correlations resulting from respondents' familiarity with the existing modes.\n\nMoreover, we employed an indirect measurement approach to capture respondents' latent behavioral constructs. This involved utilizing attitudinal Likert-type questions as indicators. Latent constructs are integrated into the choice models, resulting in hybrid multinomial logit and hybrid nested logit models.\n\nA series of five-point Likert-type statements were asked to inquire\n\nM.  et al.\n\nGuy,\" and \"Non-Car Guy.\" The detailed results of the factor analysis are presented in Table 2. Subsequently, measurement equations for each latent variable are estimated using ordered probit models as functions of the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents.

{"doc_id": 207, "text": "Based on the exploratory factor analysis results, being a \"Tech Guy\" is associated with an increased interest in emerging technologies, such as autonomous, electric, or hybrid vehicles. Individuals conforming to this profile prefer utilizing technologies like cruise control and navigation apps while driving, and multitasking in the vehicle is important to them. The measurement equation estimation results suggest that age inversely affects the likelihood of an individual aligning with this construct. Furthermore, individuals who own a single vehicle and have a monthly income within the range of 20–30 million tomans are more likely to fit the \"Tech Guy\" profile. Being retired or employed in the private sector appears to negatively influence the manifestation of the\n\"Tech Guy\" construct. \"Tech Guys\" also tend to use ride-hailing services at least once a week. However, phone usage showed no significant effect, which probably is due to the ubiquitous nature of smartphone usage, rendering its impact negligible in the context of the \"Tech Guy\" construct.\n\nThe \"Safe Guy\" construct represents individuals who prioritize safety measures in air taxi services, including the connection to ground controllers or integration with trusted taxi services. These individuals also place a high emphasis on security and are financially satisfied. Our estimation of this latent construct suggests that men, particularly those of middle age, are less likely to align with this construct, except on regional tourism trips where men are more concerned about safety, M.  et al.\n\nM.  et al.\n\nM.  et al.\n\nRegional Tourism Tech Guy Safe Guy Non-Car Guy Place of work and *residency* Lives in Tehran - 0.35 3.37 (***) –\n\nWorks in Tehran - – –\n\nAs for the \"Non-Car Guy\" construct, these individuals prefer public transport and are less inclined to drive. For them, using ride-hailing services is also more comfortable than driving. According to our results, women and older individuals are more likely to identify with the\n\"Non-Car Guy\" profile. The number of cars owned by an individual's household is highly correlated with this construct, suggesting that fewer car ownership aligns with being a 'Non-Car Guy'. Additionally, individuals with lower income levels also fit this profile. Interestingly, frequent use of ride-hailing services was also found to be correlated with the '\"Non-Car Guy\" construct. It is worth mentioning that the \"Non-Car Guy\" did not emerge as statistically significant for the regional tourism case study. This was expected, as public transport is not a convenient option for tourists anyway.\n\nHader et al. (2020) suggest three main use areas for the UAM functioning as city taxis, as airport shuttles, or as intercity taxis. Straubinger et al. (2021a) identify five groups of potential UAM users, including inner-city citizens, outside commuters/suburban dwellers, airport passengers, tourists, and companies. Based on a simulation approach, Ploetner et al. (2020) estimate the UAM market share in Germany, ranging from 0.5 percent over distances shorter than 10 km up to 3 to 4 percent over distances longer than 30 km. Al Haddad et al. (2020) emphasize that UAM is not competitive in terms of travel time saving over short-range trips. In the same context, Pukhova et al. (2021) conclude that UAM will not save much travel time over short distances, especially when one takes into account the access/egress trips to/from vertiports, implying that UAM is more competitive over medium to long ranges. Similarly, Rothfeld et al. (2021) conclude that UAM provides time savings beyond respective distances of a 50 to 55 min car ride. As for the number of passenger seats in an air taxi, Reiche et al. (2018) observe that high-passenger-capacity aircraft are systematically preferred to low-capacity ones, probably due to their lower per capita operational costs.\n\nBased on the above discussion, trip purpose, range, and vehicle capacity are the trifecta of criteria that are considered in the design of our case studies. We considered three trip purposes, including weekly business, airport access, and regional tourism. These trip purposes were selected based on their relevance to operations along regular routes (Long et al., 2023) over long-distance (Ilahi et al., 2021) in the 30-to-50-km range corresponding to regional routes. Moreover, we focused on occasional trips and placed a strong emphasis on fare as the primary determinant of UAM usage, which is in line with previous studies (Reiche et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2019). The vehicle type was introduced as a four-seater eVTOL, guaranteeing aviation-grade safety level.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0969699724001017-main.md"}

Tehran has two major airports, one dedicated entirely to domestic flights within the city borders, and the other only operating international flights, located some 30 km to the city's southwest. Ground access to the IKA international airport is provided by road and an urban train line, which operates as an extension of the Tehran metro. Fig. 3 shows the relative location of Tehran and the IKA international airport, along with a typical aerial route between a well-known international hotel in the northern part of the city and the international airport. Avoiding crossing the congested city network is a reasonable incentive for passengers to choose air taxis for their access trips, to save time and reduce mental fatigue (Brunelli et al., 2023; Rimjha et al., 2021a). Therefore, in the second case study, we offer six scenarios with four modes of transportation, including private car, public transport, and ride-hailing taxi, as the three existing modes and air taxi as the new mode.\n\nPloetner et al. (2020) emphasize the UAM market potential for tourism and leisure, and Tez et al. (2022) indicate generally favorable attitudes towards the use of UAM technology among tourists, who view it as a fast, comfortable, and in general \"fashionable\" mode of transport.\n\nAccording to Lee (2023), there is an urge from the South Korean UAM\ngroup to establish collaboration for the development of air tourism on the country's southern coast and its marine tourism resources such as Hallyeohaesang National Park and many islands and beaches. Paris is planning to establish a tourist UAM route to Versailles in 2024 (Goldstein, 2023), and Brisbane is working to provide UAM services for the 2032 Olympics (Wisk Aero, 2023).\n\nShiraz, a city of 1.6 million residents in the Iranian mid-south, is one of the country's major metropolitan areas and a prime tourist and pilgrimage destination. Persepolis, the world-renowned capital of the ancient Persia, which is the main tourism attraction of the region, is located some 50 km to the northeast of Shiraz. Fig. 4 shows the relative location of Shiraz and Persepolis and a typical direct aerial route between the two. Currently, the only way to access the site from Shiraz is by road, which involves an approximately 90 min drive. It is, therefore, a reasonable destination for operating an air taxi shuttle for tourists who would consider the service as an occasional timesaving and leisurely opportunity, justifying the high cost.\n\nNotably, the choice of the Shiraz-Persepolis route was influenced by both the prominence and recognition of the Persepolis site, and the logistical and technological sufficiency of Shiraz as a major city and a regional hub. It should be mentioned that Iran boasts numerous other tourist routes with similar appeal, including many southern islands in the Persian Gulf.\n\nM.

Statements related to air taxi safety received consistently high scores, with particular emphasis on two aspects: the ability to establish communication with a ground operator at will, and the installation of a security camera in the vehicle. Respondents expressed their preference for postponing the use of air taxis, which agrees with Al Haddad et al.\n\nFor each trip purpose, hybrid multinomial logit and hybrid nested logit models are estimated. The hybrid multinomial logit model serves as the baseline, and the hybrid nested logit model tests for the similarity among the existing alternatives in contrast to the new emerging mode. The PandasBiogeme software package (Bierlaire, 2023) was used for the estimation of the models. Tables 6–8 summarize the estimation results for the multinomial logit and the nested logit models. 5.2.1. Case 1: A typical weekly business *trip* The sample includes 214 valid questionnaires with 1284 choice tasks. The stated modal shares are 47% for private car, 13% for ridehailing taxi, 11% for air taxi, and 29% for public transport. Table 6 summarizes coefficient estimates and t-statistics of the final model specification for the hybrid multinomial and hybrid nested logit models. Only estimates that are statistically significant at a 0.1 level or better are included.\n\nFor weekly business trips, the air taxi value of time is estimated at 1,340,000 tomans per hour ($47.9 per hour) based on the hybrid multinomial logit model. Also, the public transport value of time is estimated to be 8500 toman ($0.30 per hour). On the other hand, using the hybrid nested logit model results, the value of time for air taxi and public transport is estimated at 1,324,000 tomans per hour ($47.3 per hour) and 9000 tomans per hour ($0.32 per hour), respectively.\n\nBeing male and being in the middle-income tier of 9 to 14 million tomans increases the propensity towards using air taxis for weekly business trips compared to ride-hailing. It is worth mentioning that higher income tiers have similar effects of increasing the utility of air taxis, albeit at weaker that 0.1 significance levels. Thisis probably due to the modest size of the sample. The \"Tech Guy\" construct positively influences the utility of the air taxi mode, while the \"Safe Guy\" construct has a negative effect. The \"Non-Car Guy\" variable positively impacts both ride-hailing and public transport modes.\n\nFor airport access trips, the common private car and ride-hailing value of time was estimated at approximately 71,100 tomans per hour\n($2.53 per hour) using the hybrid multinomial logit model. The air taxi value of time was estimated at 532,000 tomans per hour ($19.0 per hour) using the same model, which represents approximately 40% of the air taxi value of time for weekly business trips.

{"doc_id": 210, "text": "Three stated preference surveys were conducted, aiming to characterize the prospective demand for urban air taxis for weekly business, airport access, and regional tourism trips in Iran. The value of time estimates varied appreciably among the three trip purposes, as summarized in Table 9. The airport access value-of-time was estimated at $19.0 per hour based on the hybrid multinomial logit model, which is nearly 40% of the weekly business trip value-of-time of $47.9 per hour. Moreover, for airport access trips, the air taxi value of time is about seven times greater than that of the private car and ride-hailing, portraying a totally different picture compared to other contexts. This is mostly due to the fact that car trips in Iran benefit from a heavily subsidized gasoline price, which is provided at less than ¢10 a liter, making car-based modes, including auto and ride-hailing, more affordable compared to other contexts (Lesteven and Samadzad, 2021). The weekly business trip value-of-time is also significantly greater than the value estimated by (Karimi et al., 2023), which can be attributed to the long-distance interurban character of the weekly business trip explored here, allowing to appreciate the travel time savings offered by the air taxi more. As for the estimation of the value of time for public transport in the case of weekly business, the value is notably low. This can be attributed to the subsidized ticket prices for mass transit. In fact, the estimated value of time is roughly equivalent to a round-trip ticket price for this specific case.\n\nWe could not estimate the tourism air taxi value of time from our data. However, by comparing the private car value of time estimates for the two trip purposes, it is safe to assume that its value is significantly lower than the airport access trip, meaning that people would be willing to pay much less for air taxi transportation for tourism. The presence of family members during a tourism trip contributes to amplifying the\n\nTable 9\n\nSummary of the value of time estimates (per hour).\n\nTrip purpose Air taxi Ride-hailing Private car Public transport\n\nMNL NL MNL NL MNL NL MNL NL\n\nWeekly Business $47.9 $47.3 n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a. $0.3 $0.32\n\nAirport Access $19.0 $17.2 $2.53 $3.52 $2.53 $3.52 n.a. n.a.\n\nRegional Tourism n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a. $0.88 $1.01 n.a. n.a.\n\nUnlike the two other trip purposes, gender impacts the selection of the mode of transport for weekly business trips. Men are less likely to use ride-hailing taxis. Individuals aged between 25 and 44 are less likely to use air taxis, and those between 45 and 54 are less likely to use public transport. Individuals aligning with a \"Tech Guy\" profile are more likely to use air taxis, while aligning with a \"Safe Guy\" profile has a negative effect on the utility of choosing air taxis.\n\nFor an access trip, respondents' current travel pattern has a similar impact as that of a tourism trip, meaning that people who use ridehailing taxis regularly are more likely to use air taxis. Individuals who are identified as \"Safe Guy\" are also less likely to choose air taxis.\n\nWe explicitly asked respondents about incentives that would convince them to adopt urban air mobility. Based on the answers depicted in Fig. 5, decreasing travel costs turns out to be by far the most effective, followed by providing adequate time to gain trust. Although safety is the least stated concern, it is rather due to the fact that in the brief presentation of UAM in the questionnaires, the respondents were reassured that air taxis would provide, at a minimum, what was called the aviation-level safety standard.\n\nWhile higher income was found to increase the utility of the air taxi for weekly business trips, the effect was entirely inverse for regional tourism trips where individuals in higher income tiers favored the private car. This is a significant finding which suggests that people traveling for weekly business and regional tourism purposes follow completely different behavioral frameworks. Contrary to Brunelli et al.\n\nThis research analyzed the prospective air taxi demand and investigated the factors affecting the adoption of UAM.

One should eventually be prudent not to suggest trading one congested mobility layer with another far more challenging technologically and economically over the foreseeable future, no matter how intriguing such an idea may sound, as some of the best estimates do not predict over five percent market share (Rimjha et al., 2021b; Ploetner et al., 2020). While in the Californian context, Rimjha et al. (2021b) raised concerns about the possibility of UAM congestion during peak hours, in Iran as well as other developing countries, the aim should be to identify niche markets in which a UAM ecosystem can be implemented viably, allowing for further integration.\n\nOur study suggests that the market for regularly operated interurban air metro for weekly business travelers between Tehran and its main satellite city of Karaj, is quite within reach. This result aligns with similar findigns by Ilahi et al. (2021) in the context of Jakarta. Moreover, access to the international airport of Tehran is also valued at approximately half the figures estimated by Rimjha et al. (2021a) in a North American context for non-Business cases. In fact, the Iranian government does not subsidize international flights; therefore, contrary to the car-based modes that benefit from inexpensive gasoline, Iranian international flyers view the price of an air taxi trip in relation to their international flight ticket price. Tourism seems to be a less viable market for air taxis, at least among the nationals. Further research is needed to determine the viability of a market for foreign tourists and travelers.\n\nThere are limitations to the current study. Firstly, respondents do not have any firsthand experience with air taxis; therefore, their understanding of the attributes of air taxis is, at best, unsubstantiated. This is a general limitation of any study that relies on stated preferences to draw conclusions, as it is based on hypothetical scenarios. As suggested by Shaheen et al. (2018), one way to address this issue is to include virtual reality experiments that allow respondents to experience an immersive simulation of flying on board an air taxi, thereby increasing the authenticity of their responses. Secondly, the study's data collection approach was based on self-reported answers, which could be subject to biases such as social desirability and recall bias. This may have an impact on the precision of the study's results. Finally, the sample sizes were relatively modest. It is expected that larger sample sizes will contribute to more statistically significant estimations.\n\nFuture research can place greater emphasis on scenario design, tailoring scenarios to each respondent based on their specific characteristics and the context of the case studies. Personalizing these scenarios will enhance the relevance and accuracy of the findings. As previously mentioned, the use of immersive technologies, such as virtual reality, can significantly improve the authenticity of respondent experiences, addressing the limitations inherent in stated preference studies.\n\nAdditionally, the high cost associated with air taxi travel presents a unique challenge for household decision-making. Future studies should explore considerations involved in choosing air taxis for shared family travel. This approach will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing air taxi adoption at the household level, which is a deciding factor differentiating tourism trips in contrast to business or airport access trips.\n\nMahdi **Samadzad:** Writing - review & editing, Writing - original\n\nAnsari: Writing - original draft, Visualization, Software, Formal analysis, Data curation.

One trend Urbanization is one of the most significant megatrends of our time. It will accumulate many challenges to cities and arranging the people's mobility in a sustainable way is one of the largest one. In people transportation, increasing the share of public transport combined with walking and cycling is seen the most efficient way to advance sustainable urban mobility. Since data-driven digital services have become an integral part of the optimization of transport as well as customer experience, their importance is paramount when looking for more sustainable solutions.\n\nWhen seeking novel services for public transportation, the open innovation paradigm could be considered as a viable approach to apply. The term open innovation refers to the increasing invocation of external cooperation and \"purposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries\" (Chesbrough and Bogers 2014). One trend of supporting this open-innovation paradigm is the living lab approach. It can be described as \"physical regions or virtual realities where stakeholders form public-private-people partnerships (4Ps) of firms, public agencies, universities, institutes, and users all collaborating for creation, prototyping, validating, and testing of new technologies, services, products, and systems in real-life contexts\" (Westerlund and Leminen 2011). So-called provider-driven living labs are arranged by public organizations as well as private companies to co-develop new products, services and solutions. Much of the innovation is about generating useful knowledge for everyone in these co-operation networks (Schuurman et al. 2013).\n\nTampere Urban Rail Mobility Services (TURMS) is an urban mobility innovation environment operated by Tampere Tramway Ltd (abbreviated as TRO) and supported by research organizations including Tampere University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It combines a public transport vehicle as a physical platform and a cloud-based data space as a digital platform, for creating an authentic and secure innovation, development, and testing environment for novel mobility solutions and services. In the core of the environment is an operative tram that is dedicated to technology and service experiments in addition to the normal daily plying. The test tram manufactured by Škoda Transtech belongs to the operative fleet of twenty trams in city of Tampere's new tramway opened in 2021.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2352146523009535-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 215, "text": "TURMS living lab arrangement forms a data ecosystem, which allows organizations with shared interests to collaborate around information securely and dynamically (Oliveira and Lóscio 2018). The term data ecosystem also refers to an infrastructure that organizations use to collect, store, analyze and leverage data. The objective of this paper is to describe the technical perspective of the data ecosystem and define system requirements and the architecture of the digital platform envisioned to support data collection and distribution in TURMS living lab ecosystem.\n\nThe concept of living labs has been strongly supported in EU framework programs. According to Pucihar et al. \n\nKostiainen et al. (2016) presents similar living lab approach (compared to this paper). The presented Living Lab Bus (LLB) initiative was aimed to increase the attractiveness of public transport as well as developing new commercial opportunities among the companies participating LLB living lab experiments. LLB was based on a fleet of electric buses in normal operation in Helsinki area Finland. These e-busses were used as a concrete real world laboratory environment for collecting data, validating solutions, and getting user feedback to innovate, test, and develop solutions to improve public transport experience and operations.\n\nA normal requirement analysis (known also as requirement engineering) is the process of defining user needs and expectations for a new system being built. The main difficulty of this analysis in TURMS living lab case is the long-planned duration (six years) of the environment enabling experiments. Since it is not possible to analyze all users' needs and sort out their expectations beforehand, we have tried to envision some more generic requirements in TURMS context. As a result of this work, following specific requirement areas were recognized: *data ecosystem* support, living lab operational support, technology and service development support.\n\nSince all these areas are important and very wide topics intrinsically, we can only highlight some overall requirements and introduce only most notable observations related to this paper.\n\nFrom the data ecosystem viewpoint, data-sharing challenges among TURMS participants was recognized as one of the most challenging issues to solve for enabling co-creation and new data-based innovations. Govindan et al. (2020) have summarized three main typologies of data-sharing barriers:\n- Companies might be fear of unintentionally giving away valuable or sensitive data about the business, fear of losing negotiation power or a competitive advantage and lack of visibility into data usage and analysis once shared.\n\nAlso fear of technological lock-ins (high switching cost) exists. The goal of TURMS data environment is to lower the described hurdles. The data platform should be able to:\n- Enable building trust between data ecosystem participants. A data governance program is needed, which clearly defines the ownership of datasets and effectively promotes dataset-sharing rules.\n\nFor increasing trust among ecosystem participants, TURMS platform should efficiently manage data access and keep tracking on usage. Industrial (or International) Data Spaces (IDS) (Jarke 2017), an open multi-sided platform \n(MSP) for secure and trusted data exchange (Otto and Jarke 2019) can pave the way to approach these topics. Data security and privacy needs should be an essential part of the TURMS core functionality.\n\nEnabling data exchange among ecosystem participants need some data catalog structures since organizations require finding, inventory and analyzing diverse data assets available in TURMS environment. Ensuring interoperability and enabling data exchange among ecosystem participants also require some type of agreement of common data formats and interfacing standards.\n\nWhen studying more closely living lab operational needs, it is possible to identify two main sub requirements categories for the further analysis: *management support for living lab* and *technological living lab experiment aids*. The managerial task of operational experiments during living lab contains several phases (Wellsandt et al. 2012):\n- The co-creation activity refers to joint development of concepts and scenarios for a service or a product. In TURMS environment, this means contacting to TRO and supporting research organizations for iterative negotiation of needed resources and time scheduling related to experiments. Documentation of this activity includes an initial idea of an experiment, definition of required resources and functionalities, needed hardware devices and software and time schedule devoted to the experiment.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2352146523009535-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 216, "text": "For enabling management related functions for different experiment phases common shared workspaces, documentation systems, shared calendars for scheduling etc. are required. Unfortunately, only limited amounts of studies have investigated of living labs facilitation, co-creation and feedback tools. Mengual et al. (2018) have tried to classify tools supporting living lab integration into following groups:\n- Tools for passive observation that enable interact non-invasively with prototypes featured in living labs. Passive integration tools can be included indoor tracking systems for recording people movement patterns and emotions recognition observation technologies. Affordable depth cameras have opened new opportunities to activity recognition and Human Behaviour Analysis (HBA) for many application fields from retail to at home for elders in AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) environments (Liciotti et al. 2017). Emotion recognition can be based on human performed analysis utilizing either real time or recorded video capture observations. Combining of technologies such computer vision, machine learning and speech processing to help people with emotion recognition is a relatively new and fast developing research area. Facial emotional recognition is essentially a pattern recognition problem and involves finding regularities in the set of data being analyzed. Other factors also contribute to the recognition of a person's emotional state like as body language, gestures, voice and the direction of the gaze. Emotion recognition utilizes of all these factors with contextual information to infer accurate results \n(Mehta et al. 2018).\n\nThese methods and tools used for support experiments set requirements for the data handling in TURMS \nenvironment where the data should be processed and how it accumulates to the system requiring storage space for analysis. Especially camera and video data require special attention both in management (issues related to GDPR) and in technical sense. Storing and accessing of large video material arouse some challenges for living lab support environment.\n\nThe third area of requirements was the technology and service development support. In addition to the passenger related service development platform, TURMS living lab functions also as testbed for the tram infrastructure experiments. Usage scenarios related to these tasks were: 1) passenger counting and related services, 2) automatic operations (automatic driving) especially at depots, and 3) infrastructure maintenance (rail system, vehicle condition management).\n\nTransport operators are seeking for a cost-effective solution for robust passenger counting that will cover all transportation means. As a real-world operating environment, TURMS living lab platform is an ideal place to make passenger image and video based counting technology experiments and support for those should be provided by the platform. These types of experiments need to consider GDPR issues.\n\nAutomatic driverless rail operations are intensively studied due to a need to control operating costs, growth in passenger volumes and needs more frequent service and an increased safety need. TURMS living lab data environment is intended to support test data collection, analyses and algorithm development for autonomous tram operations first in depots, later in other test contexts. A combination of sensor data (radar, video cameras, and lidar) with deep learning procedures (AI, Artificial Intelligence) is the solution for a vast majority of autonomous driving cases. These sensors generate excessive amount of data to be processed in the TURMS environment that should be handled accordingly.\n\nAdvances of statistics measurement methods and cost-efficient sensor technologies have made preventive and condition-based maintenance (CBM) as a mainstream for infrastructure uphold like preservation of the existing transport network. Various kind of methods can be applied on CBM and recently machine learning techniques have been studied intensively also on the area of railway tracks maintenance. Development of new machine learning (ML) \nmethods for maintenance require high quality and huge sample datasets that the data platform should enable to collect and handle efficiently. These data sets might contain remarkably high frequency sampled IoT data types thus generating immense volume of data.\n\nThe technical specification of the Urban Mobility Data Space, presented in this section, is based on the high-level \n\nThe Fig. 1. below presents an illustration of the overall concept of the TURMS environment. The core of the concept is the vehicle environment, in this case a tram, that provides the platform for the data collection and services. On top of the vehicle(s) is the research data platform that connects the tram context to the wider transport context and provides link between the vehicle environment, data and the services. At the outer rim are the various co-development tools and services that provide access to the resources at the vehicle and data platform and form a linkage between living lab ecosystem and technical environment.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2352146523009535-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 217, "text": "The key asset for traffic intelligence is the use of high-quality mobility data available from various sources like public transportation vehicles, smart city sensing systems and other appropriate data origins. In public transport domain there is a growing need for accurate, reliable, and real-time information from transport infrastructure. Vehicles are ideally suited for environment surveillance and sensing, acting as a kind of mobile sensor platform that can offer wide geographical coverage (although time dependent) with limited number of cameras (compared to the number of cameras need in case of fixed camera installations). By looking at the sheer amount of generated data (e.g., with camera-based sensing it is order of a gigabytes per hour per vehicle) it is obvious that simply dumping all raw data to a cloud server, if desirable at all, is not a realistic option. Therefore dynamic, real-time and context-aware selection of which content to store onboard, and which send to a cloud server is an important research question to be addressed.\n\nTURMS data-architecture (Fig. 2.) is based on a micro service model where small and stand-alone services jointly constitute more extensive service bundles and combinations. This model enables easy and flexible introduction of new data management functions and configurations. The open-source approach for architecture modules enables participation in the platform and service development for anyone interested and it is based on a concept on how to utilize existing and open resources, such as open data, open or shared API's and open-source software components for minimizing unnecessary replication of existing functionalities and focusing to truly value adding components.\n\nThe vehicle (tram) acts as a mobile sensor platform providing an extensive and real-time situational awareness of both the vehicle and its surroundings. It consists of an edge cluster computing unit for controlling the collection and propagation of data and enabling its pre-processing as well as hosting 3rd party software. The edge platform also allows means for provision of services and content to passengers utilizing onboard computing power, and public displays at tram's compartment. The utilized edge computing model places the computing resources at the network edge enabling development of local services with quick response to the changes in the environment and for reducing the amount of data to be send to the cloud. In addition, in some use cases like in camera-based passenger counting, privacy issues may also affect the decision between edge and cloud processing locations. With the edge computing approach, it is possible to pre-process part of the data in the vehicle edge node and send only the calculated parameters or features to the application located in the cloud.\n\nAlthough edge computing offers solutions for many data handling challenges, it is not complete solution alone. A \ntypical vehicle edge-computing platform is usually quite resource constrained in terms of CPU, memory, disk space, energy consumption, so the decision of what is processed locally and what is send to the cloud, is essential. The decision process where to perform calculations should be quite dynamic and dependent of the context. This would require mechanisms to deploy distributed data-analysis functionalities and algorithms to the vehicle nodes in a dynamic manner.\n\nAnother formidable challenge relates to security and privacy aspects. The connected edge-computing node inside the vehicle is probable more vulnerable to potential security risks compared to traditional cloud-server environment. \n\nOn the other hand, it is possibility to keep the privacy sensitive raw data (e.g. captured video or picture material) inside \n\nThe *Urban Mobility Data Space* acts as a cloud-part of the TURMS environment processing all the data created by the vehicle unit(s). In addition, it also collects additional data from the whole transport system and the surrounding smart city context and acts as a centralized hub where data can be accessed for analysis and integration. It harmonizes data into usable and uniform structures and provides managed APIs and applications to access the data. The internal architecture of the *Urban Mobility Data Space* is divided into the following five layers (Fig. 3.).\n\nData Collection and Preparation Layer provides necessary interfaces for data injection both from tram fleet and external transport information systems. The main data injection interface is MQTT message broker where the MessageHandler component subscribe the needed message streams. Upon receiving a message carrying data, the MessageHandler injects the data object to a message buffer that provides a queueing mechanism for scalability. The Data Pre-processing module then reads the data from the buffers and depending on the data type performs set of quality control and harmonization tasks. After which the data is passed to the *Data Storage Layer*.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2352146523009535-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 218, "text": "The *StorageEngine* module handles the storage functions for the data. Depending on the data type, e.g., if the dataset is intended to be shared through real-time API, data is stored to the noSQL storage (Redis) for minimum delay. Some data types are indexed and stored to the SQL-storage as time-series model and can be accessed and queried through API layer. As the amount of data received every day is huge, the datasets are not permanently stored in the data base. Every day the Batch processor module converts previous day segment of collected data into a CSV clump and archives it in Azure Blob storage.\n\nAs in many cases analytics services may require making queries on structured data also for older data, the Query Access Engine provides the reverse fetching of archived data from azure blob storage to the SQL database. The *Service* Layer provides all the functionalities related to the interaction with services and other external users. The developer portal combines tools and documentation necessary for 3rd party developers as well as overall API management.\n\nThe *Interoperability layer* aims for providing functionalities that enable secure and trusted data exchange with external data platforms. The layer contains the data connectors needed to achieve integration with European data interoperability frameworks (Gaia-x, IDS and European mobility data spaces).\n\nThis paper defined specification for the necessary technical environment required to support the TURMS living lab data ecosystem. In addition to TURMS needs, the specified technical environment serves more generally as a mobility research data environment serving also other research and development activities in the smart city context. The TURMS platform technical specification is based on the high-level requirements of the TURMS living lab and the use cases. It comprises of a cloud environment, offering access to data and other living lab resources, and of a vehicle environment that offers an operational tram as a vehicle ICT platform. The platform is built as an open data integration architecture that utilizes existing standards and solutions, as well as governance and business models, to facilitate secure and standardized data exchange and data linkage in a trusted business ecosystem. It provides a basis for creating smart-service scenarios and facilitating innovative cross-company business processes, while at the same time guaranteeing data sovereignty for data owners.\n\nBased on this work, the next step is the implementation and deployment of the concept and the supporting technical environment to the operational Tampere tramway environment. The operational TURMS platform will enable an authentic and secure innovation, development, and testing of novel mobility solutions and services in factual tramway environment for all interested parties.\n\nThe work was done as part of the SmartRail\\#1 project.

Despite the significant research efforts made in recent years [11,12] to address the developed state of infrastructural systems deterioration, particularly in the Western world [9], infrastructure monitoring is still far from being widely implemented. Furthermore, most monitoring systems and instrumentation, such as piezoelectric-based sensors, electric strain gauges, and fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors require the installation of a restricted sensor quantity at discrete positions along the infrastructure \n[13,14]. The fundamental constraint of present infrastructure monitoring methods is the bottlenecks in their scalability to large-scale structures due to maintenance and rapid increase in required sensor numbers with growing structural size for accurate assessment [1,15,16]. Among the common infrastructure monitoring technologies, self-sensing composites, which possess inherent sensing capabilities grounded in piezoresistive behavior, offer the most integrated, real-time, and pragmatic solution for infrastructure monitoring [13,17]. \n\nAs stated, the heat-generation capacity of cement-based composites has recently attracted significant interest, mainly because of its role in energy-efficient applications, snow melting, de-icing, and conventional self-healing mechanisms [18–20]. Built-in heating pipelines [21–23], \nSelf-heating coating [24,25], phase-change materials [26], and super-hydrophobic coating [27], have frequently been employed to attribute heating performance to various civil structures. Nonetheless, challenges including suboptimal energy efficiency, high production costs, and the host matrix degradation potential have posed hurdles to \n\nSelf-sensing and self-heating cementitious composites are based on the incorporation of the conductive phases such as short fibers [3], as well as micro- and nano-particles, mostly carbon-based materials [33], into non-conductive host matrices, to provide electrical conductivity \n[34–37]. Indeed, the conductive phase establishes arbitrary conductive pathways through electron tunnelling effects and percolation mechanisms. This enables the conversion of mechanical strain into measurable alterations of electrical resistance [14]. Furthermore, passing a certain amount of electrical current through these conductive paths causes an increase in the temperature of the composite [38–41]. \n\nDespite recent advances and various research carried out on different self-sensing and self-heating composites including, cementitious \n[42–46], bitumen [47–50], and polymer composite [51–56], the lack of studies on geomaterial as an integral part of structural layers of transportation and railway infrastructures is noticeable. Furthermore, allocating sensing and heating capabilities simultaneously to structural elements and infrastructure is still challenging. A novel self-sensing cement-based geocomposite composed of stabilized sand has recently been developed by the authors using hybrid graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) [1,14,17]. A compatible and effective method for dispersion was initially designed and developed in this context [57]. Thereafter the effects of different conductive fillers on the piezoresistivity behaviour, and mechanical, microstructural, and durability performances of this cement-based geocomposite were assessed [13,14,17]. The impacts of various measurement methods, electrode layout and section scale on the sensing capacity of this composite as an initial step to developing a field-applicable, smart cementitious geocomposite, were investigated [15,16].

In addition, the self-sensing performance of this cementitious geocomposite for the asphalt layer strain detection was evaluated in a hybrid section including the asphalt mixture layer and smart geocomposite. The damage diagnosis ability of the composite was also assessed using digital image correlation analysis. This research promises significant contributions to innovative intelligent civil engineering structures, particularly within transportation and railway infrastructure layers. \n\nThe multilayer type of GNPs and multiwall CNTs were used in this research work which were supplied by Graphenest and IoLiTec companies.

The images illustrate the uniform arrangement and distribution of these GNPs, indicating their potential for effective reinforcement within the composite matrix and emphasizing their role in enhancing the overall mechanical and electrical properties of the \n\nFor this purpose, TBP was initially dissolved in water, and subsequently, a 10% proportion of Pluronic F-127 (by weight of CNMs) was introduced into the suspension, which was thoroughly homogenized using a magnetic stirrer. When assessing both the physical attributes and piezoresistive properties, it was determined that the ideal concentration of the hybrid CNT/GNP blend (in a 1:1 ratio) for the advancement of an intelligent cement-based geocomposite was approximately 1.0% (by weight of the sand) [5,15–17]. Hence, the same concentration was used in this study. Continuous stirring was performed after adding the CNMs to the suspension. It was then necessary to place the suspensions in a bath sonicator for 3 h with 80 W and 45 kHz output power and frequency, respectively. To maintain a temperature of 40 ◦C during the \n\nAccordingly, for the composite preparation in this investigation, 10% \ncement (by weight of sand) was also employed. Based on previous studies the 8% water (by weight of the dry sand) also was used for the specimen fabrication concerning physical properties and dispersion issues. The prismatic specimens with dimensions of 40 × 40 × 160 mm were made using the compaction method [15,16]. Initially, cement and sand were introduced into a steel bowl and subjected to blending using a stainless steel blade rotating at a speed of 140 rpm. Subsequently, CNM \nsuspensions, prepared with the optimum water content (�opt ≈ 8% by weight of the sand), were sprayed into the mixture and agitated at a higher speed of 285 rpm. Following this, the blended mixture was carefully transferred into a plastic bag to mitigate moisture loss. The specimens were then fabricated utilizing the compaction method in adherence to the ASTM D698 compaction standard. Three equal-height layers of wet mixture were filled into split moulds. Based on a density of 2 g/cm3, the required amount of the well-mixed wet mixture was calculated [17]. A metal tamper was used to compact the wet mixture to the desired height (measured by a calliper with 0.02 mm accuracy). Both sides of the compacted mixtures were sealed. The specimens were subsequently extracted after a 24-hour and were cured for 28 days in the standard condition. Four copper plates (10 ×50 ×0.3 mm) also were embedded during the fabrication process to pass electrical current along the specimen as illustrated in Fig. 5. The embedded section of the copper plates was precisely drilled to enhance the surface area, enabling better electrical contact and minimizing contact resistance. This method ensured improved conformity to the irregular surface of the composite, thereby facilitating precise and dependable electrical measurements. 2.2.3. *Mechanical and microstructural investigations* The compressive and flexural strengths of the specimens were assessed following a 28-day period of hydration and curing, following \n\nThe holes were covered with cement paste again after the thermocouple installation.

The specimens were placed into a digital chamber, and the temperature was gradually elevated to 120 ˚C, where it was maintained until the thermocouple registered a stable temperature reading.

Throughout the measurement process, the digital multimeter and data taker were placed outside the chamber. The temperature impacts on the composite piezoresistivity responses were also measured under cyclic loading shown in Fig. 9(a).

For this purpose, the thermography camera was first calibrated and adjusted at the proper distance and different DC \ncurrents (3, 6, and 9 A) were applied to the outer electrodes during the measurement. The self-heating power was calculated by Eq. 2, which is the power in mW/˚C that caused an increase in the internal temperature of the specimen by 1 ◦C. \n\nP = I × V\nT − Tmax(2) \nthe current is represented by I, while the corresponding voltage is denoted by V. Additionally, the room temperature is indicated by T, and the maximum internal temperature of the specimen during the test is designated as Tmax. \n\nFor cementitious geomaterials, the elastic modulus is typically expressed as the modulus at 50% of the peak stress [69,70], and the specimens' tangent E50% was calculated at this stress level. As can be observed, the incorporation of 1.0% CNMs into the cementitious stabilized sand, didn't cause significant changes in the flexural and compression strength of the composite. However, as presented in Fig. 11 (b), the compression elastic modulus of the smart composite was increased by around 29%. Meanwhile, the compression failure strain of the composite was reduced by approximately 20% influenced by the inclusion of the nanomaterials. The literature reports a similar trend for cementitious composites reinforced with CNMs [17,71,72]. \n\nThese mechanisms significantly enhance the load-bearing capacity and the forces required for crack initiation and structural failures. When a crack encounters an embedded CNT and/or GNP, it becomes obstructed, necessitating an additional load increment for further crack propagation \n[15]. Generally, the inclusion of an optimum concentration of CNMs (in terms of mechanical aspects) into the cementitious composite, improves the physical performance of the cemented-base composite through crack bridging and deviation [73–75], hydration rate enhancement [76–78], \nand filler effects [13,79]. \n\nCNM inclusion can promote cement's pozzolanic reaction, particularly in the early ages. A majority of the CNTs and GNPs in fresh cement are dispersed throughout the pore solutions and absorbed by the cement grains [80]. There is substantial empirical support indicating that CNMs, whether existing in agglomerated or individual states, serve as initiation points for the formation and subsequent growth of cement hydrates. \n\nAs a function of temperature, the surface adsorbed water is evaporating first in the range of 25 to 105 ◦C.

{"doc_id": 223, "text": "The temperature at which these compounds lose water is determined by the ratio of CaO to SiO2 in hydrated cement. The third peak at 400–600 ◦C is caused by the dehydroxylation of Portlandite (Ca(OH)2) \nformed during hydration. \n\nFinally, the last endothermic peak represents the decarbonisation of calcium carbonate in the hydrated compound (CaCO3, CC) recorded at approximately between 600 and 800 ◦C [85,86]. The curves all indicated the higher hydration degree of the CNM-reinforced composite. An identical trend was also observed in the XRD patterns (Fig. 14). \n\nAs compared with the plain sample, the calcium hydroxide (CH) and C-S-H peaks in the smart composite containing the CNMs were both higher, while the C2S and C3S phases corresponding to un-hydrated cement grains were lower. \n\nThe trend of FCR during the monotonic load increasing up to the failure point is illustrated in Fig. 15. The slopes of the stress-strain and FCR-strain curves in each stage, indicate the modulus and gauge factor respectively. The typical strain distribution in the last captured DIC \nimages at different loading stages is also shown in Fig. 16. An appropriate correlation between FCR and modulus can be observed which can be a bright horizon to detect the mechanical behaviour and consequently damage levels of the self-sensing cement-based geocomposite through FCR analysis. The loading process of the specimen increased linearly with strain increments up to 0.011. In this stage, the conductive fillers and paths are closer together under compression which reduces the electrical resistivity. By this point, the stress has reached 65% of its maximum capacity. The amount of modulus and FCR in this stage are roughly 710 MPa and 4 respectively. With increasing the load in the next stage, the amount of strain becomes higher than the elastic threshold and the mechanical behaviour of the composite enters the non-linear region. At this stage, nanoscale cracks begin to form. As the load increases to 93%, these cracks progress and propagate until the first microcrack appears on the specimen surface (Fig. 16 (b). The amount of modulus and FCR in this stage are roughly 576 MPa and 21 respectively. As cracks form and propagate in the microstructure of the composite, the specimen becomes less stiff and therefore leads to conductive paths approaching. \n\nThe specimen's loading force exhibits a roughly steady trend as strain increases in the next stage due to crack propagation and energy release (Fig. 16 (c)). The average amount of modulus and FCR in this stage are roughly 91 MPa and 42 respectively. \n\nThe trend of FCR and strain changes during an increasing cyclic compressive loading till the failure point is shown in Fig. 17. Under cyclic compression loading, an appropriate correlation was also observed between FCR and mechanical behaviour. Cyclic incremental compressive loading also showed a similar trend. The typical strain distribution at different stages of cyclic compressive loading is illustrated in Fig. 18. The first microcrack appeared on the surface after approximately 91% of the loading of the specimen (Fig. 18 (b)). As shown in Fig. 17, the mechanical behaviour of the composite enters the non-linear region after 63% loading which caused the residual strain upon completion of each cycle. In response to increasing loading rates and crack propagation, residual strain increased significantly. \n\nDemircilioglu ˘ et al.

{"doc_id": 224, "text": "The impact of temperature on the electrical resistance characterization of self-sensing cementitious composites is contingent upon various factors, such as the water-to-cement ratio [88–90] , concentration and type of functional fillers [91–96] , as well as pertinent cement and pozzolanic materials [96] , aggregates [97] , temperature ranges [98, 9] , and type of the electrical current [100] . Consequently, the findings reported in the literature lack consistency and uniformity. Demircilioğlu et al. [99] studied the effects of temperature on the electrical resistance and strain sensitivity of smart concrete reinforced with brass fibres. They noted that the electrical resistance of the smart concrete exhibited a linear decrease with temperatures up to 50 °C, suggesting the possibility of compensating for this effect in strain sensing applications. However, at higher temperatures, particularly beyond 150 °C, the strain mismatch among brass fibres, cement paste, and aggregates caused damage, leading to a notable increase in electrical resistance, reaching approximately 613%.\n\nThe electrical resistivity of carbon cement-based composites exhibits reversible reductions upon gentle heating [101,102] . This phenomenon is attributed to thermal energy facilitating electron movement across interfaces within the material. Consequently, carbon cement-based composites can effectively operate as thermistors for temperature measurements, essentially achieving temperature-sensing. While this property may complicate strain or damage sensing, its impact on strain\n\nAs shown in Fig. 19 (b), there is a well-defined relation between electrical resistance and temperature which proved the great potential and capability of this smart cement-based geocomposite for temperature sensing applications in the field. The piezoresistivity behaviour of the smart composite in different temperatures is also depicted in Fig. 19 (c). The stress gauge factor of the composite exhibited an elevation from 0.3 to 0.37 and 0.62 as the temperature was raised from 35.6 ˚C to 59 ˚C and 102 ˚C, respectively. \n\nThe results showed an improvement in the sensing performance of the composite with increasing temperature. It can also be seen that increasing the temperature caused an increase in the amount of the strain, which can be one of the reasons in terms of piezoresistivity enhancement. Meanwhile increasing the kinetic energy of the electrons and electrical conductivity of the specimen with rising the temperature can boost the electron tunnelling effects and consequently improve the composite piezoresistivity response against stress. Previous studies also revealed a similar trend [3104,105]. \n\nAt temperatures of 35.6, 59, and 102 ˚C, the amount of GF for the strain sensing was 165, 116, and 155, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 19 (c), although increasing the temperatures led to an increase in FCR \nlevels, the strain amounts were also amplified at the cycle's peak simultaneously, due to physical and microstructure alterations. Since the ratio of strain changes did not align with the ratio of FCR changes, the gauge factor alterations did not correspond to the incremental shifts in FCR. Indeed, increasing the temperature can potentially enhance stress sensitivity, while may not improve the strain sensitivity of the composite. This phenomenon appears to be contingent upon the microstructure and physical behaviour of the composite when exposed to temperature elevation. \n\nWang et al. [104] also observed that an increase in moisture content within carbon cement-based composites leads to a substantial degradation in strain-sensing effectiveness, particularly concerning repeatability and stability. they noted that this effect was attributed to moisture-induced polarization, which is linked to the material's dielectric behaviour. Encapsulation of the cement-based material with epoxy has been demonstrated as an effective solution to mitigate this issue, as exemplified in the case of carbon black cement-based material [108]. \n\nTeomete [98] and Demircilioglu ˘ et al.

As can be observed, increasing the loading speed caused an increase in FCR corresponding to the loading less than elastic threshold stress. However, in the case of loading further from the elastic region, increasing the loading speed decreased the FCR values. A similar trend was also observed in the strain values which is aligned with the achievements of the previous studies [109]. \n\nIndeed, deformations occur quickly with loading in the elastic region \n(especially in preliminary steps) and increasing the loading speed, deprives the microstructure of the opportunity to return the deformations.

In the elastoplastic region, deformations occur for a relatively longer time, hence increasing the loading speed causes a decrease in the strain and FCR values. \n\nGenerally increasing the loading frequency from 0.1 Hz to 0.5 and 1.0 Hz, increased the FCR values by around 54% and 109% for the loading corresponding to the elastic region (1.25 MPa), respectively.

The findings demonstrated a strong connection between the strain and FCR. Moreover, as the stress magnitudes increased, the stability of the FCR values also increased. The results demonstrated that within this range, the loading shape had no discernible effect on the stress and strain gauge factors. \n\nThe piezoresistive response of the smart cementitious geocomposite under continuous incremental and long-term cyclic loading is presented in Fig. 23. The results indicate a unique correlation between strain changes and FCR values which proves the high potential of this composite for traffic monitoring. (Fig. 23 (a)). The significant changes in FCR values (approximately 42%) affected by the low amount of strain (0.0008) and load changes (1 kN) showed the supreme capability of this cementitious geocomposite for high-resolution traffic recognition and \n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 23 (b), the stability of the FCR values and their correlation with strain changes after 250 compression cycles, also showed the proper sensing performance of this composite for long-term detection.

This section included a typical SMA11 asphalt mixture layer [67] on top which was installed on the cementitious geocomposite with bitumen binder (Fig. 7(b)). The purpose of conducting this experiment was just to provide an idea to investigate the ability of composite sensing in a quasi-real pavement structure and also to assess the sensing potential of the smart geocomposite for the asphalt mixture layer strain detection. Hence, further detailed research is left to future studies. Nowadays, there is a growing interest among researchers in developing self-sensing asphalt composites [50,114]. However, the generation of an applicable smart asphalt composite is still faced with many challenges due to visco-elastic behaviour, conductive filler dispersion challenges, heterogeneity, cost of production and its complexity, low durability, and the direct effects of environmental factors [115]. \n\nHence using smart cementitious geocomposite as an assistant layer for the asphalt composite in order to strain and stress detection might be a proper idea to overcome the existing challenges, particularly due to the high self-heating and temperature sensing capability of the smart cementitious geocomposite which can be employed for the self-healing applications in asphalt composite.

However, more comprehensive studies are still required. \n\nTypically, the Joule effect, or the heating mechanism associated with electric resistance, occurs when electrons move within an electric field and dissipate their kinetic energy when they interact with the atoms of a material, which causes carbon-cement composites to self-heat \n[116–118]. In order to facilitate the healing process in the top layers of bitumen or polymer composites, it is possible to apply this concept to structural materials and layers of the infrastructure by using the structural material itself to melt the ice (or to prevent it from being formed). \n\nFig. 25 shows the heating rates for smart cement-based composites at various currents.

Box 1982, Dammam 31451, Saudi Arabia ARTICLE INFO \n\nGreen Mobility emerged as a practical approach for promoting environmentally friendly and sustainable transportation in cities. This study is carried out with the main aim of finding the advantages and viability of Green Mobility in the future cities of Saudi Arabia. The quantitative research methodology is used to obtain credible data on the benefits of implementing green mobility through the perspective of government officials dealing with environmental issues. A \nvalidated questionnaire was administered to respondents working in the environmental protection sector. All analysis was carried out by using SPSS version 20. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated. The inferential statistics were obtained using the regression and Pearson correlation tests. Findings have shown a significant connection between Green Mobility and its environmental benefits that enhance the quality of life in Saudi Arabia. Green Mobility is associated with the incremental investment, time-saving, reduction of traffic congestion, climate protection, improving health benefits, air quality betterment and diversification of energy supply. \n\nOverall, this study's findings have emphasized the need for an integrated and clear policy designed within a national framework. \n\nWorldwide, the urban population is increasing rapidly at a rate of 1.9%, accounting for 55% of the world's total population [1]. \n\nOver the next 40 years, the population is expected to double in urban areas. It has been projected that 70% of the world's population will live in cities by 2050 [1]. Such a population explosion will be accompanied by an increase in the ownership of automobiles, resulting in adverse social, health, and environmental impacts. This, in turn, will create great concern in finding strategies to combat these effects [2]. Expanding the cities and building roads are the primary means of overcoming the urban transportation effects and meeting the demand for accessibility. But this will lead to more usage and ownership of cars resulting in environmental degradation, pollution and congestion. This prompted a need for urban sustainability, known as zero energy cities, smart cities, eco-cities, low carbon cities and sustainable cities. This notion entails that cities should be designed healthy, safe and user-friendly for living through \n'Green Mobility, Green Transportation and 'Sustainable Mobility. Green Mobility is defined as developing safe, efficient, responsive and flexible mobility in cities with less effort, travel and traffic while promoting environmental sustainability [2]. It means emphasizing pedestrians, good-condition vehicles and public transport, which ensures sundry and accessibility of public transport for all. In \n\nSaudi Arabia is known as the most urbanized country in the world. It has been reported that 8 out of 10 people live in Saudi Arabia's urban areas. Population growth, industrialization, urbanization, fuel abundance and climate condition have led to great motorized vehicle use. Saudi Vision 2030, recently launched in Saudi Arabia, aims to change the country from traditional cities into an environmentally sustainable country [6]. Different projects related to sustainable, smart and digital development have been proposed that facilitate this new era of prosperity and growth. Moving towards Greener things and products is one of the solutions to overcome such problems. Green Mobility has become necessary for regions like Saudi Arabia [7]. In other words, the country is moving towards utilizing green elements to overcome the said issues [8]. Green Mobility is the current requirement of the industrial section here in Saudi Arabia. The country has to perform important operations so that the mobility problems concerning air pollution can be decreased or even eliminated [4]. This study is conducted to find the advantages and viability of Green Mobility in the future cities of Saudi Arabia. \n\nIt means that the advantages of Green Mobility can be informed to the higher authorities of Saudi Arabia so that they can make new policies or change the policies about the same requirements to become more competitive [9]. In this way, the Saudi Government can overcome this problem and works more diligently to make their mobility greener and safer for the environment. The second scope that was found highly significant for the completion of this research is to provide sufficient grounds for the researcher to conduct the same research in the future with complete authenticity [9,10]. In other words, this particular research will provide sufficient evidence available to make green mobility. This section concludes that the scope of this research is broad, especially in the environmental context of the future cities of Saudi Arabia. After covering this section, the next section covered here is the Literature review, in which a review of the past literature has been covered to make the research more efficient and comprehensive. \n\nThe cities of Saudi Arabia face different urban transport issues, such as motorized vehicles.

{"doc_id": 229, "text": "Cities in Saudi Arabia are changing and growing rapidly, and with the increase in population, the demand for more and various house types, access to increasing services and job opportunities are causing the increasing number of vehicles and transportation modes [9,10]. Carbon emissions and energy use are increasing significantly, mainly in the transport sector. The current transport system is one of the major causes of emitting greenhouse gases, air pollution, health implications, global warming and environmental degradation [9,10] According to Hamdan (2005), Green Mobility/Transportation is those modes of transportation that do not depend on the factors that become a significant part of diminishing natural resources such as fossil fuels and other natural resources in particular [12]. Green Transportation is also known as Sustainable Transportation. Many countries across the globe are now focusing on implementing such tactics to enhance the effectiveness of their transportation system and visualize strong economic growth. \n\nEndorsing the exact definition, Pasin & Oner (2018) further added that sustainable transportation modes generally focus on renewable energy sources, and these factors have a low impact on the environment and assist a country in reducing certain environmental problems completely [3]. Social and Environmental effects are quite essential to identify by the organizations, and Green Transportation is doing a great job adding value to people's lives by cleaning the whole environment [3]. \n\nDeveloping a green and sustainable transport system is an effective solution to achieving or overcoming mega cities' transportation \n\nAltuwaijri et al. (2019) conducted a study in which they found sustainable mobility extremely significant and connective with incremental investment in the country [15]. The researcher initiated and covered the study in the region of the United States, in which the quantitative method was considered. The primary data collection method was considered accordingly, in which a sample of more than 550 individuals was taken. The researcher has connected the viability with other important variables and found that incremental private investment in a country has a strong and direct connection with local jobs and value creation [15]. With the help of the research, a positive connection is found between the variables, which revealed that the higher the focus on sustainable mobility, the higher the investment in a country, and it is equally favorable for the creation of jobs within the state [15]. \n\nAlmannaa et al. (2021) also found that Green Mobility is essential and effective for overcoming environmental and social issues \n[16]. The three variables found in this study to achieve green mobility are time-saving, safer roads and more space for people. A qualitative method was considered, and more than forty studies have been included in the research to determine the connection between Green Mobility and its core advantages [16]. The researcher ended up with three of the most notable ones, saving time, safer roads and creating more space for the people [16,17]. Two of the most important and notable benefits of Green Mobility found and stated in previous studies are Climate Protection and Improved Health Benefits. The researcher conducted the study in the region of Germany, which is one of the most high-profile technological countries in the world. The quantitative method was taken into consideration [18]. The findings of this study showed that Green Mobility is significant for the countries. It is helpful for countries to devise strategies to enhance the viability of climate protection and its health benefits [18]. \n\nAina, A., Al-Naser & Garba (2013) conducted a study related to the environmental hazards in the Asian Regions and found that the problem of environmental hazards can be curtailed with the help of sustainable travelling or green mobility [19]. The researcher found three main benefits connected with sustainable mobility: diversification of the energy supply, betterment in the country's air quality, and stabilizing the quality of life [19].The literature review supported the assumption that green mobility is vital for reducing the harmful effect of transport and for meeting the goals of building sustainable and healthier cities in urban areas [20,21]. The below-mentioned hypothesis is likely to address in this research. \n\nHo: No significant connection is found between Green Mobility and its environmental benefits that enhance the quality of life in Saudi Arabia. \n\nHA: A significant connection is found between Green Mobility and its environmental benefits that enhance the quality of life in Saudi Arabia. \n\nApart from mentioning the hypothesis, the next important thing here is to identify and mention the framework, which is essential for the identification of dependent and independent variables. The theoretical framework is as follows (Fig. 2). \n\nAs a concluding remark of the section, it is found that many studies in the same domain were carried out in different countries. \n\nHowever, this study is filling the gap by identifying that Green Mobility deems equally favorable for Saudi Arabia to strengthen their environment and improve their quality of life. \n\nSaudi Arabia Kingdom is the largest country in the Arabian Peninsula, with a land area of 2.15 million km2 and 31 million [22].

In this study, the geographical focus is on Riyadh city, the capital of Saudi Arabia. During the last five decades, Riyadh city has transformed from a walled town to a metropolitan area with almost six million [22]. \n\nA cross-sectional quantitative study was carried out in the capital city of Saudi Arabia for six months. The quantitative method was used as it fits into our study purpose better. Quantitative data is statistical and structured, which helps generalize findings. This method also allows us to survey a representable population to obtain credible data as we aim to determine the benefits of implementing green mobility through the perspective of government officials dealing with environmental issues. The sample size was calculated using Yamane's formula and came out to be 70, comprised of government officials directly linked with handling environmental issues. The purposive sampling technique was used to select the participants. This technique is used as it allows targeting the relevant individuals to collect the most desirable information essential for completing the research. The participants were selected based on their willingness to participate, educational background, organization, level of experience, and role in the environmental protection department. \n\nA pretested and validated questionnaire was designed based on the literature review [18]. The questionnaire comprises Likert Scale Questions, with each question having five options (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Neutral; 4 = Agree; 5 = Strongly Agree 0. \n\nThe questionnaire included participant background, experience level, and perspective on green mobility benefits. The 5 Likert Scale questions have been used in this study as it is easy to understand for the participants, and less effort is needed to complete this. Another reason for using the five scale Likert Scale questions is that data can be collected relatively fast from a large number of participants, and the interpretation validity can be established through different means [23]. The questionnaire was created in English and Arabic so that participants do not face any difficulty. The validity was determined by the pilot study carried out among seven respondents dealing with environmental issues. The Cronbach alpha value came out to be 0.72, after which no changes were made to the questionnaire. After this, the questionnaire was finally distributed to the study participants. Written informed consent was taken from the participants willing to participate in this study. The participants were briefed about the study objectives and were assured confidentiality and anonymity. \n\nThe government officials were directly contacted in their departments, and questionnaires were distributed to them. Some questionnaires were sent to participants through email. The purpose of the research was explained to all participants, and any explanation needed to understand the questionnaire was given. Informed consent was attached to each questionnaire, and participants were requested to fill out the questionnaire in 20–30 min. No personal information like name, email address and phone number were taken from the respondents to make their presence anonyms for the research users. The questionnaire was left to those who were busy at that moment and was collected the next day. \n\nThe information collected from the respondents was entered into the SPSS version 20, and descriptive and inferential statistics were analyzed. The relevant tests applied here are descriptive statistics, correlation and linear regression. The main reason behind selecting these tools is related to the quantification aspect. Linear regression effectively tests the hypothesis accordingly, while Pearson Correlation is another important statistical tool used to analyze the relationship (if any) between the dependent and independent variables, as mentioned above. \n\nIn this study, 67 questionnaires were duly filled and returned to researchers giving a response rate of 95%. Descriptive statistics that is found in this study include mean standard deviation and range, as shown in Table 1. However, the main focus is on the mean and deviation from the mean. As mentioned earlier that Likert Scaling is considered for the completion of the research, therefore a specific narration is associated with each of the mean values, and these narrations are as follows: 1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Neutral; 4 = Agree, and 5 = Strongly Agree.

In this study, incremental investment researcher means whether the Green Mobility Policy in Saudi Arabia could increase the investment within the region. The mean value came out to be 4.22. Most of the individuals agreed that the Green Mobility Policy in Saudi Arabia could help the country increase their investment effectively, which is equally favorable for living a good life. The second independent variable is time-saving, for which the mean value came out to be \"3.87′′, which is tilted more towards \"4\". As per the narration, it means Agreed. It means most of the respondents in this study stated that policy to move towards Green Mobility in Saudi Arabia could save citizens' time, especially on the roads. This factor is highly significant for this scenario's long-run growth and viability. The third variable covered in this study is the reduction in traffic congestion by implementing the Green Mobility Policy in the main cities of Saudi Arabia. The mean score came out to be '3.96′, which means that most of the respondents agreed that the Green Mobility Policy in Saudi Arabia could help reducing the traffic congestion on the roads, which leads to higher environmental benefits, and ultimately it increases the prosperity of life. \n\nThe most valuable and significant variable covered in this study is climate protection. The mean value for this variable came out to be 5, narrated as strongly agreed. Most of the respondents strongly agreed that Green Mobility Policy in Saudi Arabia could bring attention and viability to Climate Change which is quite significant in the daily routine of life. In terms of improvement in health benefits, the mean score was 4.24. This means most respondents agreed that Green mobility in Saudi Arabia helps improve people's overall health and a better overall environment. Betterment of air quality with the implementation of the policy of Green mobility can improve the air quality level in this region, which is beneficial for long-run competitiveness and the environment. The last independent variable covered here was related to the diversification of the Energy Supply. It means that the researcher wants to know from the respondents if the policy to have Green Mobility in Saudi Arabia could diversify their utilization of the natural source of energy and move more toward renewable energy, which is more environmentally friendly and efficient. The Mean Value here is \"3.67\". It means that most individuals agreed with the same fact, and this factor is essential for enhancing environmental sustainability. \n\nPearson correlation is used in this study to determine the relationship between independent and dependent variables.

The two important benefits are reducing climatic problems and enhancing the air quality professionally. Hence, this particular factor should be taken into account by the higher management of the country. The analysis also found that reducing traffic congestion is another lead towards the enhancement of the environment, and it directly links with living a prosperous life. \n\nRegression is the most important part of statistical analysis, and it is generally referred to with the testing of the hypothesis, which is about the claim mentioned earlier.

The F \nvalue came out to be 0.029, which is lower than 0.05 showing that the alternate hypothesis is accepted and the null hypothesis is rejected. This means a significant connection is found between Green Mobility and its environmental benefits that enhance the quality of life in Saudi Arabia. The benefits related to Green Mobility are already covered in the previous discussion, such as descriptive statistics analysis. In the conclusion of this chapter, it is found that environmental well-being can be achieved by future cities of Saudi Arabia with the implication of Green Mobility within their specific region. \n\nThe alternate hypothesis is accepted in this study, demonstrating a significant connection between Green Mobility and its environmental benefits that enhance the quality of life in Saudi Arabia. The Green mobility concept has been given significant importance \n\nThe findings of this study revealed that Green Mobility in the Kingdom is becoming an important structure for attaining its environmental objectives, especially concerning the concept of Going Green. This particular analysis shows the same result as found in the study conducted by Ref. [28]. The researcher pointed out that reduction in traffic congestion is essential from the viewpoint of the economy, as it will be helpful for them in having strong compliance with the requirements of Going Green. Based on these findings, it is suggested that a good policy to reduce traffic congestion is needed. This will help the country to get one step closer to the concept of Going Green and improve the quality of life [29]. Another important finding of this study is that Green Mobility is associated with improved health benefits. The researcher found a positive and direct connection with the same variable, which institutionalized that when Green Mobility increases in the countries, the social benefits also increase tremendously, which is helpful in health and viability. \n\nThis particular result is the same as Boglietti, Barabino & Maternini, (2021) in their research. The research mentioned that Green Mobility is viable and connective with long-run efficiency and development [30]. With Green Mobility, the Government of Saudi Arabia could increase health benefits for their users because of the lower traffic congestion that puts lesser stress and pressure on the citizens [30]. The study also shows that Green Mobility is associated with Air Quality betterment, which is important for attaining environmental benefits. Most countries across the globe are working hard to strengthen their mobility and make it greener so that air quality can become viable and competitive [30,31]. The researcher found a positive and direct connection with the same variable, which institutionalized that when Green Mobility increases in the countries, the environmental benefits such as air quality betterment could possibly increase. Osman et al. (2021) yielded a similar study in which they mentioned the importance and implication of air quality betterment. The researcher mentioned that moving towards Greener concepts, including Green Building and Green Transport, could be helpful for the countries to have betterment in air quality, and the same implication applies to the region of KSA as well [32]. The study found that when Green Mobility increases in the countries, the diversification toward more energy options increases. Previous studies also mentioned that the most important diversification factors focus on the renewable energy section, which is an important element for the countries, including KSA [33]. \n\nBased on the finding, it is recommended that policymakers should focus on the Green Mobility concept to achieve some significant progress in the future. Policy Makers of Saudi Arabia should develop strategies from which they can exercise different options related explicitly to Green Mobility, renewable energy and reduction in traffic congestion, as it will help promote economic, social and environmentally friendly benefits in future cities. The researchers recommended that policymakers should focus on diversification of the energy supply that helps reduce the cost of energy and is beneficial to the environment and the economic viewpoint of a country.

Recently, Green mobility has become a local, national, regional and global agenda and interest. Green mobility promotes economic, social and environmentally friendly benefits in future cities. The two main advantages of green mobility are improving the health benefits for the citizens of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, along with having better air quality in the country, which is equally beneficial for the long-run viability of the citizens of the country, and the sustainability of its future cities. A positive connection was found between Green Mobility and Environmental Benefits in the future cities of Saudi Arabia, especially the main cities such as Riyadh, which has a lot of traffic congestion. Such environmental benefits are equally significant for enhancing the social and health benefits, including proper health perspectives. There is an utter need for diversification in the energy supply in which more focus should be provided on renewable energy factors essential for long-run sustainability and viability.

Although this research study has provided strong evidence of an association between Green mobility and environmental protection and quality of life, it has some limitations. The present study only gives a general picture of green mobility advantages from government officials working in the environment department. Secondly, the small sample size is another limitation of this study. Another limitation is the lack of secondary data about green mobility in Saudi Arabia that helps strengthen the environment and improve the quality of life.

First, AV would influence urban transportation and human mobility by reducing vehicle ownership, public and active travel, traffic delay and congestion, travel costs, and by increasing accessibility, mobility, Vehicle Miles Traveled, and revenue generation for commercial operators. Second, AVs would have long-term effects by encouraging dispersed urban development, reducing parking demand, and enhancing network capacity. Third, AVs would reduce energy consumption and protect the environment by reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions. Fourth, AVs would reduce traffic crashes involving human errors and increase the convenience and productivity of passengers by facilitating for multitasking. However, most people are very concerned about personal safety, security, and privacy. Finally, the study identifies critical research gaps and advances priority directions for further research. \n\nA number of high tech firms and more traditional automobile companies have been working assiduously to develop Automated Vehicles \n(AVs), which can arguably be seen as a new mobility option (Moorthy et al., 2017; Narayanan et al., 2020). While institutional bottlenecks and socio-technological challenges continue to frustrate the meaningful commercial deployment of AVs (Day, 2021), it is often anticipated that AVs would deeply change human mobility, the built environment, the socio-economic fabric of cities, and city planning and governance \n(Fayyaz et al., 2022; Grindsted et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). Meanwhile, decision makers and city planners should prepare policies and plans consistent with a mobility landscape where AVs occupy a prominent position. To date, much research has been conducted on the potential People have used the automobile as a primary mode of travel within and between urban areas since the mid-twentieth century (Howard & \nDai, 2014). Nowadays, it has become an integral part of urban life. \n\nTechnological advancements such as the introduction of Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs), transmission systems, electric motors, steering and cruise control, and emission control technologies are easing people's life and reorganizing city structure (Kim, 2018). While providing benefits to populations, automobiles are also adversely affecting human societies and their environment. The massive use of Single-Occupancy Vehicles (SOVs) is associated with travel delays, traffic congestion, traffic crashes, energy consumption, air pollution, and urban sprawl. \n\nMutation of the transportation system by shifting from ICEs to Electric Vehicles (EVs), and by introducing Intelligent Transportation Systems \n(ITS), ride-sharing, on-demand services, and Travel Demand Management (TDM) measures has shown evidence to reduce energy use and carbon emission, traffic crashes and congestion (Bansal & Kockelman, 2017; Howard & Dai, 2014).

Considering the preeminence of people's safety and security in shaping travel patterns, previous studies have also explored urban futures with AVs from the perspectives of personal safety, privacy, and security. These studies have serious drawbacks including a heavy reliance on assumptions, simulations and hypothetical driving settings, which may deviate from real-world situations. Nonetheless, they are significantly contributing to the current body of literature aimed at unraveling the possible responses to AV adoption in human travel patterns and in the urban built environment.

Although the phasing of the effects is still unsettled, may remain in question for some time, and is subject to adjustments (Hancock et al., 2019; Milakis, 2019), it is assumed that short-term effects will be realized starting with the introduction of AVs for public use rather than in the more distant future. On the other hand, long-term effects will continue for a long time period after adoption of AVs. However, researchers have argued that long-term effects of AVs are uncertain and largely depend on the level of market penetration of AVs and on the evolution of vehicle travel demand (Milakis et al., 2017). Mid-term effects fall in between short- and long-term effects of AVs. To the best of our knowledge, no prior review has explored the current status of AV adoption and the anticipated evolution over a certain time horizon.

The potential impacts of AVs are presented in the fourth section. Under Section Four, Subsection 4.1 outlines the impacts of AVs on transportation and human mobility, Subsection 4.2 explains the impacts of AVs on traffic safety and convenience to people, Subsection 4.3 summarizes the impacts on energy and environment, and Subsection 4.4 discusses impacts on the urban built environment. Research problems and directions for future study are discussed in the Fifth Section. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section Six. \n\nThis systematic literature review is conducted to identify, evaluate, and critically analyze relevant scholarship on the current status and impacts of AVs. To this end, a literature search is conducted to select published articles and reports to be included in the review process. The articles and reports are selected based on (1) whether the article/report was written in English, (2) whether the study was conducted within the last five years, and (3) whether the study has investigated the impacts of AVs, Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs), and CAVs, on transportation and mobility, environment, and urban form. However, a few studies conducted before 2015 are included in this systematic review to provide a comprehensive overview of possible scenarios and technological developments related to AVs, SAVs, and CAVs. ScienceDirect, Scopus, SAGE Journals, SpringerLink, Taylor & Francis, and Web of Science, the website of different organizations, and Google Scholar are the primary sources to search for suitable articles and reports. \n\nSeveral keywords are used as the search terms, namely \"autonomous vehicle\", \"connected and autonomous vehicle\", \"self-driving car\", \n\"driverless car\", \"urban form\", \"urban development\", \"parking\", \"congestion\", \"safety\", \"accident\", \"energy consumption\", \"emission\", \"vehicle ownership\". The following search strings are used to retrieve relevant articles from each of the database: (\"autonomous vehicle\" OR \n\"connected and autonomous vehicle\" OR \"self-driving car\" OR \"driverless car\") AND (\"urban form\" OR \"urban development\" OR \"parking\" OR \n\"congestion\" OR \"safety\", \"accident\" OR \"energy consumption\" OR \n\"emission\" OR \"vehicle ownership\") AND English.

However, after careful assessment of each item, only 130 items were deemed directly pertinent to the search terms and objectives of the study. They form the basis of this systematic review. Of these items, 18.84%, 7.25%, and 4.35% of the articles have been published in the following three periodicals, respectively: Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, and Transportation Research Record. About 87% of the articles and reports were published from 2015 to 2020. Also, 46.27% and 18.66% of articles/reports pertained to North American and European countries, respectively. In addition, 8.21% and 3.73% of studies have been conducted in Asian countries and Australia, respectively. Moreover, about 11.94% of them are review studies and 11.19% have been conducted in multiple countries. During the selection process of articles/reports, the researchers were careful to select them from different study contexts to get a comprehensive review. These research items are critically analyzed to understand the current and future implementation of AVs and their impacts on transportation and mobility, environment, and urban form. However, we would like to acknowledge that the vast majority of studies \n(about 69%) are conducted in a Global North setting. Although we attempted to generalize findings from different studies, considering the socioeconomic, cultural, and geographic diversity in the Global South and North contexts, all research findings may not equally apply to all national contexts. \n\nThe key concepts and themes discussed in the extant literature are presented in Fig. 2. Many studies focused on the impacts of AVs on energy consumption (26.15%) and traffic delay and congestion (23.85%) \nfollowed by Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) (20%) and Greenhouse Gas \n(GHG) emission (20%). Also, a considerable number of studies have explored the effects of AVs on parking demand (19.23%), travel costs and revenue generation (19.23%), safety, security, and personal privacy \n(18.46%). In contrast, a few studies discussed the possible integration of shared mobility, AV, and EV (3.85%), impacts of AVs on employment opportunity (6.15%), infrastructure capacity (8.46%), and public transportation (9.23%). \n\nFig. 3 shows the data sources of the reviewed articles/reports. The results indicate that 29.17% and 25.69% of studies conducted webbased household surveys and simulations (e.g., field test, experimental driving), respectively, to collect data. In contrast, only 1.39% and 6.25% \nof studies used data from census and national surveys, respectively. Most of these studies used data from census and national surveys to generate \n\nHence, the external validity of studies using such data may be in doubt. \n\nAdditionally, an equal number of studies (about 18.75% each) collected information from the published literature (e.g., articles, reports) and from other sources (e.g., private, public organizations, national labs). \n\nOf the published literature surveyed (Fig. 4), 34.85% of studies used simulation techniques (e.g., agent-based simulation) to understand the impacts of AVs, and 20.45% used regression techniques (e.g., discrete choice models, structural equation models). Of the balance, 4.55% used probabilistic techniques, while the rest (40.15%) relied on other statistical methods (e.g., descriptive statistics, tests of hypotheses). \n\nAV (also known as a self-driving car, driverless car, robotic car) is able to drive and navigate without direct human inputs by using sensing technology (e.g., radar, Global Positioning System (GPS), and computer vision) and advanced control systems (i.e., sensors) (Howard & Dai, 2014; Narayanan et al., 2020). These automated vehicles are expected to bring revolutionary changes in people's mobility, transportation systems, and land-use patterns (Brown et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2017). A \ndistinctive feature of AVs is to have some level of automation to assist drivers or to replace drivers to take full control of the vehicle (Narayanan et al., 2020). According to the Society of Automotive Engineers \n(SAE International, 2018), the level of vehicle autonomy ranges from Level 0 (i.e., no autonomy) to Level 5 (i.e., full vehicle autonomy) according to technical specifications (Fig. 5).

{"doc_id": 237, "text": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) proposed a safety rule in 2016 that all vehicles produced after 2020 would be equipped with Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication technology to send and receive safety messages (Administration, 2016b). Although NHTSA has yet to mandate any V2V safety measures, it is expected that vehicles would gradually be equipped with safety equipment (i.e., short-rage communication, safety messages) to protect lives. Moreover, NHTSA has adopted the standard of vehicle automation prescribed by SAE (Administration, 2016a, 2017). These interventions from a top-tier transportation safety agency demonstrate their seriousness towards vehicle automation for curbing traffic crashes. \n\nIt is anticipated that on-demand mobility services and vehicle automation will grow rapidly in the coming decades (Jones & Leibowicz, 2019). The annual global sales of AVs would grow to $173.15 billion by 2030, with a 65.31% contribution from shared mobility (Sullivan, 2018). Thus, AV is a reality now and it is expected that it would become a daily travel mode for many people shortly (i.e., 10 - 30 years) (Stocker & Shaheen, 2018; Zakharenko, 2016). \n\nDespite enormous efforts by different companies and agencies to bring AVs to market, AVs are yet to be a regular transportation mode. Some studies have investigated the current implementation status of AVs and their future evolution across the world (Bansal & Kockelman, 2017; Nieuwenhuijsen et al., 2018). For example, Zhang and Wang \n(2020) estimated that the market share of AVs may vary from 20 to 90% \nby 2040 in Atlanta, the United States (US). Conducting a web-based survey of 246,642 Japanese residents between November and December 2015, Shin et al. (2019) reported that 53% of respondents expect AVs to be on the market in 15 years, whereas 40% expect a 6-to 10-year timeframe. Considering 2030 as the year of introduction of level 4 and 5 AVs, Trommer et al. (2018) calculated that the market share of AVs (level 4 and 5) would be 17% in Germany and 11% in the US, by 2035. Another study predicted that the market share of AVs would be about 80% in Korea in 2060 (Kim et al., 2015). Litman (2017) commented that level 5 AVs would be able to operate commercially and legally in the 2020s within certain jurisdictions and with limited performance. However, most benefits of AVs will be prominent and significant in the 2050s to 2060s when AVs would be common and affordable. \n\nBased on this discussion, an expected timeline from planning to full implementation of AVs is portrayed in Fig. 6. This implementation timeline is compiled on several articles such as Litman (2017), Bansal and Kockelman (2017), Kim et al. (2015), Shin et al. (2019), \nNieuwenhuijsen et al. (2018), and Zhang and Wang (2020). The figure illustrates that AVs would be available for people's regular use incrementally over the coming decades. Literature shows that countries around the world are resolute to test and employ AVs. At the same time, city planners are putting in place strategies to adjust to a new reality. However, most urban policymakers are yet to start formulating plans for AV adoption due to a lack of real-world experience (Gonz´alez-Gonzalez ´\net al., 2019). Thus, it is necessary to understand the merits and demerits of AVs through their impacts on people, communities, and cities for informed decision-making.

{"doc_id": 238, "text": "AVs would have both positive and negative effects on people and society. To better understand the potential impacts of AVs and their associated advantages and disadvantages, a SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat) analysis is performed after reviewing the existing literature, following (Litman, 2017; University of Kentucky, 2020). This SWOT analysis provides a framework and helps us organize and discuss the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats of AVs in a single structure. The SWOT analysis also reveals the internal (e. g., users) and external (e.g., pedestrians) factors associated with AV adoption. While Strengths and Weaknesses respectively indicate the advantages and disadvantages of AVs for their users, Opportunities and Threats illustrate their advantages and disadvantages for other people and the surrounding environments. With the underpinning provided by Fig. 7, we discuss the anticipated positive and negative effects of AVs in four segments. First, Subsection 4.1 explains the impacts on human mobility and transportation systems. Second, Subsection 4.2 summarizes the impacts on traffic safety and on convenience to people. Next, Subsection 4.3 outlines the impacts on energy and the natural environment. Finally, the impacts on the urban built environment are illustrated in Subsection 4.4. \n\nThe main anticipated strengths associated with AVs include delay and congestion reduction, increased accessibility and mobility, travel cost savings, and revenue generation for ride-sharing companies (Fig. 7). \n\nThe opportunities afforded by AVs include the reduction in vehicle ownership and the integration of SAV and EV. On the other hand, the main weaknesses of AVs are higher vehicle purchase costs and higher VMT, while critical threats would consist in an increase in travel demand and a reduction in public and active transportation. Based on the findings from the extant literature articulated in Fig. 7, this section discusses the potential impacts of AVs on human mobility and transportation system. The aspects related to human mobility encompass vehicle ownership, VMT, and accessibility and mobility. The transportation aspects discussed here include public transportation, traffic delay and congestion, travel costs and revenue generation, and integration of shared mobility, AV, and EV. User's travel costs and revenue generated by transportation companies can influence overall transportation systems. Similarly, integration of shared mobility, AV, and EV can change the overall landscape of transportation systems. 4.1.1. *Vehicle ownership* The introduction and adoption of commercial AVs are likely to reduce the need for households to own cars by way of an increase in ride-\nFig. 5. Level of vehicle autonomy. \n\nFig. 6. Expected timeline of AV's planning to implementation.\n\nResearch has shown that dynamic ride-sharing (i.e., serving multiple travelers with similar origins, destinations, and departure times) can significantly reduce the number of vehicles. For example, Levin et al. \n\nWith better accessibility and mobility, more empty-vehicle travel, and the relocation of parking spaces outside of the city center, AVs would increase per capita travel distance and VMT (Trommer et al., \n2018; Wadud et al., 2016; Zhang & Wang, 2020). People would choose to live further away from their workplace due to lower transportation costs and to the drop in the opportunity cost of travel time by multitasking, which all would lead to additional VMT (Childress et al., 2015; Gelauff et al., 2019). Thus, AVs are anticipated to increase travel distance and VMT, as summarized in Table 2. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2210670723002603-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 239, "text": "Some studies have mentioned that the average travel distance by AVs would not be significantly higher than a conventional car or taxi (Ma et al., 2017; Moorthy et al., 2017). They argued that increased VMT can be compensated by a reduction in the total number of vehicles required for passenger transport and by optimizing trip chaining (Ma et al., 2017). VMT could also be reduced by increasing dynamic ride-sharing \n(Fagnant & Kockelman, 2018; Milakis et al., 2017). Fagnant and Kockelman (2018) observed that a 20 to 30 % increase in shared trips would reduce VMT by 4.4 miles per shared-trip (i.e., a 4.2 % reduction). Thus, increasing SAVs, particularly within a high-density area, may reduce empty VMT (Fagnant & Kockelman, 2014; Levin et al., 2017). Furthermore, the implementation of a flexible work schedule could reduce the average VMT per traveler (Greenblatt & Saxena, 2015; Kyriakidis et al., \n2015). A flexible work schedule will allow workers to work at variable work rosters and SAV drop-offs and pick-ups can be coordinated to reduce empty VMT. \n\nAccording to the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, about 25.5 million Americans face travel restrictions due to disabilities (Brumbaugh, 2018). Among them, about 3.6 million do not leave their homes due to low vehicle ownership, lack of driver's license, and unemployment. They mostly depend on other family members and friends for reaching activity sites away from home. Information on the travel strategies of US people with disabilities (ages 18-64) is collected from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and presented in Fig. 8. It is estimated that 70.6% of them curtail their day-to-day travel, whereas 44.3% depend on others for travel. Also, it is reported that 21.6% of them have given up driving and 14.4% use less public transport. Moreover, 14.4% of people use special transportation facilities (i. \n\nIt has been argued that AVs are the most disruptive technologies in the transport sector, having the potential to weaken public transit ridership (Hess, 2020; Kapser & Abdelrahman, 2020; Meyer et al., \n2017). The availability of shared vehicles and the use of SAVs may be particularly effective at curtailing public transportation, as well as active transportation (Clements & Kockelman, 2017; Cyganski et al., 2018; Narayanan et al., 2020). Thus, AVs may be regarded as a major existential threat to present and future transit systems (Handsfield, 2011). \n\nHowever, when seen as a shared mobility option, AVs could be integrated with an efficient public transport system to ensure the sustainability of urban transportation systems (Narayanan et al., 2020; Sparrow & Howard, 2017). Public transport carries a large number of passengers from one station to another, but some other transport option may facilitate the transfer of people between home / workplace and the stations. AVs can solve this last-mile problem and attract passengers away from private vehicles to public transit (Moorthy et al., 2017; Sparrow & Howard, 2017). Thus, AVs should be mobilized so they would not disrupt the current transport system but increase its efficiency and cost-effectiveness instead. \n\nFurthermore, patterned after the successes of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD), Robocar-Oriented Development (ROD) (Templeton, 2012) could be promoted in areas surrounding transit stations. ROD \nwould be a high residential density and mixed-use development with minimal auto facilities. People would mainly use AVs and SAVs to travel to transit stations as a short-distance shuttle service would. There would be convenient drop-off and pick-up zones very close to stations. Multilevel drop-off or pick-up zones also could be built to optimize space utilization where land value is comparatively higher. There would be a vehicle-waiting zone from where personal and shared AVs would drop and pick up riders. Thus, through a strategic partnership with AVs, public transport would avert a declining market share and a more sustainable transportation system could be achieved.

{"doc_id": 240, "text": "Researchers also reported that an heterogeneous traffic stream (i.e., a mixture of PAVs and SAVs) could increase delay and congestion by reducing the average speed on the network (Narayanan et al., 2020). Carrese et al. (2019) reported that SAVs would yield a positive impact for intra-urban trips, but suburban commuters may experience extra traffic congestion due to the sizeable relocation of residents to the suburbs. Some people also believe that AVs are unlikely to reduce congestion and travel time in suburban, exurban, rural areas and in urban commercial districts due to higher travel demand and empty VMT in these particular areas (Meyer et al., 2017; Piao et al., 2016; Schoettle \n& Sivak, 2014b; Van Brummelen et al., 2018). To sum up, considering the potential for congestion reduction by AVs, policymakers should implement appropriate policy measures to achieve a higher rate of AV \npenetration and vehicle ride sharing. For example, a service of large SAVs (e.g., vans, buses) could be implemented to reduce traffic congestion and empty VMT by transferring groups of passengers simultaneously. 4.1.6. *Travel costs and revenue generation* Many researchers have reported that the automation of vehicles may lower travel costs for users by reducing vehicle operation and maintenance costs (e.g., fuel, insurance fees) (Kopelias et al., 2020; Nunes & \nHernandez, 2020; Zakharenko, 2016) (Table 4). SAVs could further reduce travel costs by avoiding parking fees and by reducing fleet size \n(Loeb et al., 2018). AVs ride-sourced by Transport Network Companies (TNCs) are much cheaper to users than solo driving because there are no labor costs and depreciation and insurance are lower (Compostella et al., 2020). Although the initial purchase is a major sunk cost, total lifetime costs remain minor when amortized over service life spanning as much as 400,000 miles. AVs also could reduce the opportunity cost of travel \n\nThe adoption of AVs would increase the welfare benefits of citizens and the revenue generation of commercial transportation operators (Narayanan et al., 2020). It has been estimated that AVs could yield up to 5 billion Euros in savings per year in the Netherlands alone under full automation by reducing generalized transport costs and with expected changes in modal split (Gelauff et al., 2019). Fagnant and Kockelman (2015) found a total of $196 billion economic benefits with a 90% AV \nmarket share in the US due to cost reduction for congestion, crashes, travel time, fuel use, and parking fees. It has been noted also that these benefits, although small compared to commercial taxi operation, will disproportionately be enjoyed by households in the wealthiest percentiles under full automation in personal cars (Wadud, 2017). \n\nIn summary, the extant literature shows that AVs and SAVs are likely to reduce transportation costs and increase revenue generation for commercial fleet operators. Thus, researchers have suggested to expand funding for R&D and formulating guidelines for AVs to accelerate AV use (Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015). \n\nBy coupling with a renewable power source, SAVs also provide environment-friendly transport options. An SAEV can reduce energy use by 90 - 100% compared to ICEs due to efficient travel and electrification of vehicles (Milakis et al., 2017). Conducting agent-based modeling, Zhang and Wang (2020) found that each SAEV can reduce carbon emission by 75% in California. They also observed that SAEVs are likely to reduce travel costs by reducing vehicle operation costs. Thus, the integration of AVs and EV technologies with adequate vehicles has a synergistic effect on reducing VMT, vehicle ownership, travel cost, and GHG emissions (Offer, 2015). Researchers have mentioned that future transportation would consist of shared and on-demand mobility, CAVs, and EVs to provide improved transportation services to populations. \n\nFig. 9 illustrates this paradigm shift in the transportation system with the advent of technologies where a proper integration of SAEVs will provide reliable transportation. \n\nKey strengths of AVs include people's travel safety, increased convenience, and productivity of riding time, and reduced driving stress, as indicated in Fig. 7. Prominent weaknesses AV users would confront include personal privacy breaches, technology misuse, and systems failure. On the other hand, one of the main threats people would experience is increased criminal activities.

{"doc_id": 241, "text": "The extant literature indicates that AVs would reduce the exposure of passengers to traffic crashes (Duan et al., 2020; Karbasi & O'Hern, 2022; Trommer et al., 2018; Underwood & Firmin, 2014; Vahidi & Sciarretta, 2018). Equipping vehicles with ADDS, higher levels of automation (i.e., level 3 or higher), and a high rate of AV adoption would all increase people's safety (Milakis et al., 2017). It is estimated that AVs can avoid more than 90% of all crashes that involve human errors by adding collision avoidance technologies (Chehri & Mouftah, 2019; Daziano et al., 2017; Nunes & Hernandez, 2020). More than 40% of fatal crashes due to human factors can be avoided by using AV technologies (Fagnant \n& Kockelman, 2015). Conducting a simulation study in England, Papadoulis et al. (2019) reported that CAVs would reduce traffic crashes by 12 to 94% with a 25 to 100% penetration rate. The majority of these crashes, particularly at a higher rate of penetration, would be eliminated by designing the control system of vehicles to avoid collisions in traffic merging and diverging areas due to high variations of vehicular speeds and to lane change occurrences. Using data from crash reports from 2005 to 2008, Najm et al. (2010) estimated that V2V and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication could reduce crashes by 72 to 83%. Thus, vehicle automation and various connectivity technologies are likely to reduce vehicle crashes (Begg, 2014). \n\nConducting online surveys, researchers found that 37.30 to 88.80% \nof respondents would like to adopt AVs owing to their capability to reduce the number and severity of crashes and to improve emergency response to crashes (Piao et al., 2016; Schoettle & Sivak, 2014a, 2014b). \n\nAlthough AVs could reduce the number of crashes caused by human errors, they are also prone to accidents themselves due to faulty system design (Bansal et al., 2016). Additionally, AVs would pose a threat to personal security and privacy in smart city contexts due to the reliance on electronic sensors and devices to exchange information. The main sources of concern are cyberattacks, maliciously controlled vehicles, and software hacks by harnessing technologies (Milakis et al., 2017). 4.2.2. *Convenience, productivity, and privacy* Many researchers have mentioned that AVs would increase the convenience, efficiency, and productivity of riders while incurring low transportation costs (Clements & Kockelman, 2017; Hess, 2020; Vahidi & Sciarretta, 2018). People would be involved in a variety of productive activities (e.g., reading, messaging, talking on the phone, resting or relaxing) rather than passing time idling or stressing out, which makes the journey more meaningful and useful (Piao et al., 2016; Schoettle & \nSivak, 2014b). Wadud and Huda (2019) reported that car passengers engage in 3.6 different types of activities in each leg of a journey. \n\nTalking or texting friends and looking out of the window are the most appealing tasks among people traveling in AVs (Howard & Dai, 2014; Schoettle & Sivak, 2014b). Thus, automated driving can significantly increase the convenience and efficiency of the journey by engaging people in various activities. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2210670723002603-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 242, "text": "AVs can also increase the convenience to passengers by reducing waiting time, particularly during peak hours via dynamic ride-sharing \n(Fagnant & Kockelman, 2014; Fagnant & Kockelman, 2018). Fagnant and Kockelman (2018) found that total service time (i.e., wait, pick-up/drop-off, and in-vehicle) could be reduced from 15 minutes to 14.7 minutes via dynamic ride-sharing. Although SAVs would reduce total service time by a trivial amount (about 2% savings), they can reduce average wait time significantly. Fagnant and Kockelman (2014) found that average wait time could be reduced by 51% when the trip generation rates are doubled and fleet size increased by 92% compared to the base case scenario. In contrast, wait time increased by 86.6% \nwhen trips are halved, and fleet size is reduced by 49%. Similarly, wait time increased by 206.67% when trips are quartered, and fleet size is reduced by 74.34%. Thus, a large enough number of SAVs is necessary to generate enough benefit in the convenience and service quality through a reduction in overall wait time. \n\nMany researchers have found that AVs would open the door to breaches of passengers' privacy by increasing the level of surveillance and monitoring of their mobility patterns, which may threaten people's sense of security and privacy and discourage people to buy and share AVs (Gonzalez-Gonz ´ alez ´ et al., 2019; Hess, 2020; Howard & Dai, 2014; Konig ¨ & Neumayr, 2017). Consequently, a segment of people would feel disenfranchised and be reluctant to use AVs and SAVs (Hulse et al., 2018). Similar to privacy issues, people are concerned about the misuse of technology by unscrupulous individuals (software hackers) (Kyriakidis et al., 2015; Van den Berg & Verhoef, 2016). Many surveyed riders recommend to increase the security and maintain their privacy to increase AV and SAV use (Gurumurthy & Kockelman, 2020; Panagiotopoulos & Dimitrakopoulos, 2018; Salonen, 2018). \n\nAVs have the opportunities to protect the natural environment by reducing energy use and GHG emissions. This subsection illustrates the potential impacts of AVs on energy and the environment by critically reviewing the existing literature. \n\nAs presented in Table 5, AVs are set to reduce energy use by decreasing vehicle ownership and weight, and operating vehicles efficiently by limiting acceleration and deceleration using ACC with lane assist systems and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication \n(Haboucha et al., 2017; Han et al., 2023; Loeb et al., 2018; Mersky & \nSamaras, 2016). Energy use could be further reduced by implementing the ride-sharing services of AVs, particularly in the urban areas where travel demand is higher (Greenblatt & Saxena, 2015; Ross & Guhathakurta, 2017). A coordinated flow of CAVs could also increase the energy efficiency of ICE vehicles in mixed traffic situations by establishing a harmonized relationship with the surrounding traffic even at a lower level of CAV market penetration (Vahidi & Sciarretta, 2018). Thus, prior knowledge on the roadway environment (e.g., speed limit, grade, curve), avoidance of frequent starts and stops, efficient lane change, coordinated and smooth traffic flow, proper signal phasing and timing, vehicle weight reduction and right-sizing, and vehicle sharing, could all reduce transport energy consumption significantly (Vahidi & Sciarretta, 2018; Wadud et al., 2016). \n\nIn contrast, some researchers have also found that AVs and ridesharing schemes could potentially increase energy consumption because of increased travel demand, VMT, and traffic speed, and in case automobile-oriented developments are encouraged at the outskirts of urban regions (Gonzalez-Gonz ´ alez ´ et al., 2019; Ross & Guhathakurta, ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2210670723002603-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 243, "text": "Although automation would reduce overall energy use, oil demand for electricity generation will increase to charge AVs. Kim (2018) estimated that to charge 44 million AVs with a battery of 70kWh, the industry would require 3080 GWh per day extra energy by 2030 in the US, \nassuming each AV charge once a day. About 33 more nuclear power plants of equal size to Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Arizona would be required with 24 hours of operation each day to generate that amount of electricity. Thus, the policymakers should take appropriate actions to manage additional energy demand considering the anticipated impacts on the electrical grids. \n\nResearchers found that AV technologies can significantly reduce GHG emissions (Duan et al., 2020; Fakhrmoosavi et al., 2022; Gonzalez-Gonz ´ alez ´ et al., 2019; Le Hong & Zimmerman, 2021). CAVs, SAVs, and on-demand mobility options can further reduce emissions by lowering the number of engine start, energy consumption, and vehicle ownership (Coulombel et al., 2019; Wadud & Anable, 2016). The integration of EVs and SAVs presents an added potential to sharply reduce emissions. Jones and Leibowicz (2019) found that the adoption of SAVs could be more impactful in controlling vehicle emissions than a carbon tax policy, despite higher VMT. The estimations of emission reduction by different types of AVs are presented in Table 6. Overall, AVs show the potential to reduce emissions and improve air quality. However, a lower share of AVs (i.e., 30%) could instead increase emission due to a slight rise in traffic demand and in traffic speed, and to aggressive acceleration after a stop to reach cruise speed again (Rafael et al., 2020). \n\nAVs operated as shuttle services (6 kg CO2-equivalent per passenger) \nemits lower carbon in the whole life than the AVs operated as a personal vehicle (10 kg CO2-equivalent per passenger) (Moorthy et al., 2017). However, the net effect of AVs on GHG emissions remains ambiguous (Milakis et al., 2017). Travel demand reduction due to shared mobility is canceled out by the increased travel distance and empty running (Wadud et al., 2016). Thus, further research is more likely needed to determine the actual effect of AVs on emission reduction (Rafael et al., \n2020). \n\nThe SWOT analysis (Fig. 7) indicates that AVs would have the opportunity to reduce parking demand, but would also increase roadway capacity. However, the main threats AVs may cause include increased demand for transport infrastructure and urban expansion. Based on the existing literature, this subsection recognizes the potential impacts of AVs on the urban built environment. \n\nMany studies have argued that the advent of AVs would influence the layout of urban areas (Biloria, 2023; Cugurullo et al., 2021; Gonzalez-Gonz ´ alez ´ et al., 2019; Meyer et al., 2017; Van den Berg & \nVerhoef, 2016). By reducing travel costs, AVs may affect residential and work locations, leading to intensified urban sprawl and the inefficient use of land (Fraedrich et al., 2019; Krueger et al., 2019; Zakharenko, 2016). An agent-based simulation study in Korea found new development scattered throughout the region along with growth near existing urban centers stemming from households' preference for urban amenities in a scenario where 100% of vehicles are assumed to be AVs compared to the business as usual scenario over the next five decades (Kim et al., 2015). The adoption of AVs may increase city radius by 3.5%, developed land area by 7.1%, and residential area by 7.6% (Zakharenko, 2016). Under currently prevailing policies and conditions, AVs may single-handedly result in urban expansion in the order of 10 - 30% (Litman, 2017). Thus, to facilitate the emergence of AVs without hampering urban living and development, policymakers should endeavor to better understand the potential impacts of AVs on the spatial distribution of land uses.

{"doc_id": 244, "text": "Conducting a web-based survey, Carrese et al. (2019) found that about 40% of respondents would move to the suburbs under the AV \nregime in Rome, Italy. Similarly, Wellik and Kockelman (2020) reported a 5.3 to 5.5% reduction in the number of households living in the metropolitan region of Austin, TX at a 100% AV scenario compared to a 0% AV scenario over a 27-year timespan (2013 - 2040). They also mentioned a 5.8 to 6.2% growth in the number of households living in the non-metropolitan regions of Austin. Thus, AV would influence people's residential locations by increasing accessibility, mobility, and convenience, and by reducing the opportunity cost of travel time. \n\nExperts confirmed that, in conjunction with triggering the emergence of new peripheral centers (edge cities), AVs would also densify the existing urban fabric by reallocating space for residential, economic, and leisure activities (Gonz´alez-Gonzalez ´ et al., 2019; Milakis et al., 2018). \n\nSpace released from on- and off-street parking could be used for building wider sidewalks, bicycle paths, delivery bays, new public facilities, activity centers, and high-quality recreation spaces (Clements & Kockelman, 2017; Martinez & Viegas, 2017). Since AVs can reduce car ownership, it is likely that less space will be used for streets, parking lots and garages, and possibly expand high density and mixed use developments (Dennis et al., 2017; KPMG International, 2019). Thus, AVs are likely to change the urban landscape by densifying the existing built areas. \n\nA majority of the literature points that AVs would lead to dispersed urban development by reducing travel costs and enhancing the mobility of people. Polycentric development may be seen surrounding the central urban areas due to new development induced by AVs. Consequently, it is likely that city land area and residential and commercial land uses would increase. At the same time, a densification would be observed in the city core by allocating space released from parking spaces for new residential, commercial, and recreational development. \n\nBesides influencing the physical extent of urban areas, AVs are expected to affect urban form by reducing the demand for parking in the established neighborhoods and centers (Clements & Kockelman, 2017; Kopelias et al., 2020; Van den Berg & Verhoef, 2016). As indicated in Table 7, AVs would reduce overall parking demand quite drastically. As a case in point, a recent simulation study estimated a 10% reduction in parking land area by 2020 in the Atlanta core after introducing SAVs \n(Zhang & Wang, 2020); reductions would mushroom to 42 and 75% by 2030 and 2040, respectively. Conducting a study in Los Angeles County, (Chester et al., 2015) observed that about 14% of the county area are currently used for parking. However, this parking area could be reclaimed, particularly in the city center, and repurposed for building \n\nWellik and Kockelman (2020) reported a 19.4 to 62.9% increase in developable land in Austin at a 100% AVs scenario over a 0% AVs scenario due to reduction in parking demand. \n\nIn contrast, some studies have also suggested the possibility of an increase in parking demand due to the increase in people's travel demand and in case of ride-sharing services are deficient (Zakharenko, 2016; Zhang & Wang, 2020). However, people's willingness to share vehicles, the availability of AV ride-sharing services, and higher penetration rates of SAVs can significantly reduce parking demand (Milakis et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015). Thus, researchers (Narayanan et al., 2020) have suggested to take policy actions to augment the use of SAVs and thereby reduce overall vehicle parking demand. \n\nMost previous studies have argued that higher penetration of AVs and SAVs may lower parking demand in residential areas and in business districts by reducing car ownership and increasing ride-sharing. Moreover, AVs may self-park in less expensive areas outside of city centers and reduce parking demand in the city core (Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015). For people living at the outskirts of the city and choosing to own an AV, parking at the edges of the city center may be attractive and may reduce vehicular traffic in the city. Commuting traffic could use a multi-storied parking deck to reduce space utilization in the urban core. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2210670723002603-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 245, "text": "Convenient drop-off and pick-up locations near residences and workplaces would also effectively provide great convenience to travelers. \n\nThe extant literature reveals that vehicle automation can increase road and intersection capacity by vehicle platooning, using Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), and by exchanging information between vehicles using Vehicle Awareness Devices (VAD) (Kopelias et al., \n2020; Meyer et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018). Study results summarized in Table 8 show that AVs are likely to increase roadway capacity of existing facilities more efficiently without adding any lanes (Fernandes \n& Nunes, 2012). This would curtail the need for roadway expansion. \n\nHowever, capacity could be affected by traffic heterogeneity, which could disrupt communication among vehicles (Milakis et al., 2017). \n\nGreater capacity benefits could be achieved even at a lower penetration of AVs if the non-ACC vehicle populations are equipped with VADs which can serve as the lead vehicles for the CACC vehicles \n(Shladover et al., 2012). In contrast, Narayanan et al. (2020) mentioned that AVs should be more than 20% of the vehicle population to achieve \n\nInvestigating the current status of implementation, researchers reported that AVs will be available for people's regular use incrementally over the coming decades. The findings from the existing literature show that AV would influence urban transportation and human mobility by reducing vehicle ownership, public and active travel, traffic delay and congestion, travel costs, and increasing accessibility, mobility, VMT, and revenue generation for commercial operators. Some studies also mentioned that AVs can further influence people's travel behaviors by embracing cutting-edge EV technologies and providing shared and ondemand mobility services. Investigating the long-term effects, researchers reported that AVs would encourage dispersed urban development, reduce parking demand in city centers and residential areas, and enhance the capacity of the road network. Some studies also observe that AVs have the potential to reduce energy consumption and protect the environment by reducing GHG emissions. Investigating people's safety, security, and privacy, the extant literature reported that most people are very concerned about personal safety, security, and privacy from strangers, cyberattacks, maliciously controlled vehicles, and software hacks. On the other hand, researchers mentioned that AVs are able to reduce traffic crashes involving human errors and increase the convenience and productivity of passengers by providing amenities for multitasking opportunities. \n\nResearchers also believe that SAVs are well positioned to have greater positive impacts on transportation and on the urban environment than private AVs (University of Kentucky, 2020). SAVs in a dynamic ride-sharing situation could be an effective policy option to reduce vehicle ownership, traffic congestion and travel time, and improve overall performance of the transportation system (Loeb et al., \n2018; Zhang et al., 2015). Researchers proposed to formulate appropriate funding mechanisms and policies to encourage ride-sharing and on-demand mobility among travelers to increase use of SAVs (Ross & \nGuhathakurta, 2017). Thus, pertinent policies in transportation (e.g., \nautomation of transit, integration of transit and non-motorized transport, encourage shared and micro mobility), infrastructure (e.g., \nadjustment, and redesign of existing roads), and urban planning (e.g., update of urban development plans, land-use plans, parking policies and design, green belts) are essential to realize the benefits of AVs. Moreover, the law and order situation needs to be improved to provide safety and security to passengers while sharing AVs. \n\nThe extant literature provides consistent and compelling evidence that AVs have the potential to bring dramatic changes to urban transportation systems, to their use by populations and to the spatial structure and conditions of the urban built environment. Previous review papers systematically evaluated the short and medium-term effects of AVs on transportation and human mobility and overlooked their long-term effects on the urban built environment. This updated systematic literature review identified, evaluated, and critically analyzed relevant scholarship to understand the current status and impacts of AVs on urban transportation and urban built environments. \n\nWhile significant progress has been made in unraveling the impacts of the commercial deployment of AV technologies, previous studies display some prominent limitations. Several of them are discussed below to identify research gaps and provide guidance for future studies. The research agenda includes two strands of recommendations, one on issues that have been overlooked, one on shortcomings of research conducted so far.

{"doc_id": 246, "text": "Additionally, there is a scant research on insurance pricing strategies that could be leveraged to estimate the impacts of these emerging technologies on the transportation system. Adequate field testing and civil society and professional involvements are necessary to realize the benefits of automation and to formulate policies (Crayton \n& Meier, 2017; University of Kentucky, 2020). Further research would identify and validate urban and transport policy measures to promote attractive and livable cities considering the introduction of AVs by conducting adequate field tests and by involving relevant stakeholders (Gonzalez-Gonz ´ alez ´ et al., 2019). \n\nAlthough many studies have investigated the impacts of AVs on transport energy use and on emissions, the impacts of AVs on noise and light pollutions are rarely explored, which may partly indicate their environmental outcomes (Silva Gomez ´ et al., 2022). Thus, there is a dearth of knowledge and a need to study and evaluate the possible impacts of AVs on public health and environment considering the change in human travel behaviors and urban built environment. \n\nResearch on how AVs could touch urban transportation and environments in the Global South is desperately needed to chart pathways towards a sustainable future protecting their natural environment while affording them social and economic opportunities. \n\nThis state-of-the-art comprehensive literature review investigated the short, medium, and long-term effects of AVs on urban transportation and urban environments. To understand the advantages and disadvantages associated with AVs, this review study critically analyzed previous papers and summarized the key findings based on a SWOT analysis \n(Fig. 7). The important takeaways from this study include that AVs would encourage dispersed urban development, would reduce parking demand, and would enhance network capacity. AVs would reduce energy consumption and protect the environment by reducing GHG \nemissions. Additionally, AVs would reduce traffic crashes involving human errors and increase the convenience and productivity of passengers. However, most people are very concerned about personal safety, security, and privacy due to increased surveillance and monitoring of their movement and the possibility of cyber-attacks by hackers. \n\nThus, there is agreement among various studies that AVs have the potential to influence urban transportation systems and human mobility by reducing car ownership, public and active travel, congestion, travel costs, and by increasing accessibility, mobility, VMT, and revenue generation for commercial operators. Analyzing results and methodologies, we identified key limitations of previous studies, gaps in our knowledge base, and provided a blueprint with some directions for future research.

{"doc_id": 255, "text": "Nowadays, many batteries for electric cars are made to have the best qualities from different angles, including storage effectiveness, price, safety, and lifespan. Batteries that are frequently used in electric vehicles include lithium ion, nickel metal hydride (NiMH), lead acid, and sodium sulphate (Masias et al., 2021). Due to the prompt advancement of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in the last ten years, EVs have transformed the automotive business universally. Oppositely, besides limited availability, the risks and hazards of LIBs have become an important safety issue for EVs (batteries-08, 1-v2, 0020; Hofmann et al., 2017; Gong and Sun, 2023; Feng et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Said and Tohir, 2019; Larsson et al., 2016; See et al., 2022; Duan et al., 2020; Song et al., 2022; Tanim et al., 2021). However, along with the scarcity, LIBs also pose a \n* Corresponding author. \n\nE-mail address: mollaasmare98@gmail.com (M. Asmare). \n\nEnergy demands in modern societies have rapidly increased, posing economic and environmental challenges. To overcome these challenges, clean and renewable energy must become the primary source of electricity production; however, their lack of cost competitiveness has been a major impediment to the expansion of renewable-based energy solutions (IRNEA, 2022). However, because of the intermittent nature of these green energy sources, as well as the global warming caused by the combustion of high-carbon fuels, there is an urgent need to integrate renewable electricity with electrically rechargeable energy storage technologies. Furthermore, as new energy consumers emerge, advanced energy accumulation and storage systems have become an essential component of energy generation and transmission. Because of the speedy development of advanced electronic equipment and the widespread use of electric vehicles (EVs), there is an increased demand for more energy-efficient products such as high-energy-density batteries. A rechargeable battery is an electrochemical device that stores electrical energy in a chemical solution and can be used as needed. \n\nMetal-air batteries with the highest theoretical energy densities, such as Lithium (Li)-air, sodium (Na)-air, Potassium(K)-air, magnesium (Mg)- air, calcium (Ca)-air, aluminium (Al)-air, silicon (Si)-air, iron (Fe)-air, and zinc (Zn)-air batteries, have received significantly more attention. It is a timely issue to find and develop an electrically rechargeable battery that is affordable at a reasonable cost, reliable, material available, and with less risk like Metal –Air Batteries (MABs). This article has examined alternative electrically rechargeable batteries, particularly Zn-air, Feair, Mg-air, and Al-air batteries, for future green mobility use and possible solutions. This research review will also play a significant role in driving future research and contributions in the field of advanced energy storage devices, particularly EVs and battery development. \n\nEnergy storage devices that are efficient and economical are awful to current decarbonization efforts. This is because contemporary efforts to reduce carbon emissions are dependent on efficient energy storage technologies. Batteries, as a leading flexible electrochemical energy storage device, have the potential to outline the transition from the current climate crisis scenario to a CO2-neutral and sustainable future. \n\nHowever, the fossil fuel consumption scenario indicates that CO2 equivalent gas emissions from vehicles are increasing, contributing to climate change. In 2017, the transportation industry contributed to around 14 % of total global CO2 emissions (Hannappel, 2017), rising to 25 % by 2019 (Zhang et al., 2023). As a result, EVs are being employed to mitigate environmental and climate change concerns. Passenger vehicle energy consumption accounted for 58 % of the industry in 2016, accounting for 20 % of overall terminal energy consumption (Zhang et al., 2023). Governments, industry organizations, and automobile manufacturers must all work together to minimize road traffic pollution. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2352484723016621-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 256, "text": "Metal-air batteries, in particular, are attracting scientific and industrial curiosity as viable alternatives to the ubiquitous LIBs and as a means of meeting energy storage needs in a sustainable society (Gong and Sun, 2023; Liu et al., 2022; Khezri et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2022; Wang and Xu, 2019; Sun et al., 2021; Hosaka et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2019, 2022a; Li et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022b; Liu et al., 2017; Ahuja et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021). As well, it plays in the edge-cutting of a solution for carbon emissions. \n\nEnergy demand has increased significantly as the global economy and standard of living continue to grow. As a result, developing cuttingedge rechargeable energy storage devices becomes essential to building a sustainable society. Metal-air batteries are among the most promising candidates for meeting energy storage needs (Gong and Sun, 2023; Liu et al., 2022; Khezri et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2022; Wang and Xu, 2019; Sun et al., 2021; Hosaka et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2019, 2022a; Li et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022b; Liu et al., 2017; Ahuja et al., \n2021; Li et al., 2021). Today, LIBs control the rechargeable battery market regardless of drawbacks such as low energy storage density \n(100–200 Wh/kg), high cost, potential availability shortfall, and safety concerns raised by the flammability of Li and organic electrolytes (Wang et al., 2019; Caramia and Bozzini, 2014; Zuo et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2018; European Investment Bank, 2022; Notter et al., 2010; Muslimin et al., 2022; Zhang and Revathi, 2016a; Miao et al., 2019; Franco, 2013; Medvedeva et al., 2022). Meanwhile, the highly flammable organic electrolytes used in LIBs raise the risk of an explosion, and there have been numerous reports of factory fires spontaneously exploding in cell phone batteries and electric vehicles. As a result, the public is concerned about the safety of LIBs (Peng et al., 2021; Meng et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2019a). Also, lithium-ion battery mining and manufacturing products have led to environmental concerns, and recycling lithium-ion battery pollution is still problematic (Masias et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022a; Wu et al., 2019a). Likewise, lithium-ion rechargeable batteries are not economical with some high-energy applications, such as long-distance EVs, drones, and other off-grid applications (Wu et al., 2019a; Islam and Ghazal, 2023; Dühnen et al., 2020). Additionally, the raw material and manufacturing costs of Li-ion batteries (lithium, cobalt, and nickel) \nare substantial. As a result, they are not an ideal solution for powering large electronic devices. Given this, finding and developing new dependable energy storage schemes such as MABs is an urgent duty for researchers. Also, when compared to MABs, lithium's unrivaled combination of low weight and small radius is advantageous for high-energy and high-power LIBs. However, the limited supply and uneven distribution of lithium call the long-term viability of LIBs into question and limit their widespread application. It became clear that a single type of battery could not meet all of society's growing needs all at once. As a result, extensive research has been conducted to find alternative energy storage technologies. Because of their ability to work in outdoor environments, MABs have recently gained prominence in meeting the gigantic energy demand for EVs and portable electronics (Liu et al., \n2022; Sun et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022b; Ahuja et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022a; Yu et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022; Salado and Lizundia, 2022).

{"doc_id": 257, "text": "Despite slow progress, efforts have been made to improve the energy density, power density, lifespan, cost, and safety of rechargeable batteries. As a result, the development of more efficient, safer, and costeffective battery technologies is a global research and development priority. MABs, also known as semi-fuel cells, are currently gaining popularity because they are based on coupled electrochemical reactions between metal electrodes and oxygen (O2) consuming electrodes (Lu et al., 2019; Bellows et al., 1983; Markov et al., 2016; Kumuk et al., \n2022; Molla and Ilbas, 2020; Asmare et al., 2022). In this case, opportunistic results in advancing materials, new electrode developments, and battery technology optimization were obtained. Improving the performance of the MAB electrode and electrolyte material is critical for producing more energy density at a comparable cost, allowing conventional engines to be converted to hybrid and all-electric vehicles and meeting our society's clean fuel demand. In addition, there is a growing interest in advanced energy storage device research and development to create next-generation MABs with increased storage efficiency, charging speed, and safety to replace resource LIBs. \n\nIn the quest for safer, greener, more compact, cheaper, lighter, and more powerful energy storage technologies for vehicles, the development of metal-air batteries for power, electronic equipment, headphones, and so on has gained importance. MABs have a high energy density of 400 to 1700 Wh/kg (Zuo et al., 2020). It has metal electrodes such as calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), zinc (Zn), iron \n(Fe), and alkali metals such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) combined with electrolytes (with or without water) and bifunctional air electrodes. Its working principle is based on the electrochemical reduction of molecular oxygen in the air and reverse oxidizing metal electrodes to metal oxides. \n\nCompared to Li-ion systems, these systems should be more energy efficient due to the elimination of the need for oxygen (O2) storage, the use of more available materials, and improved safety (Wang et al., 2019, 2022a; Li et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2016; Zindani et al., 2023; Boaretto et al., 2020; Zou and Ben, 2022). In addition, the volume and weight of the battery, one of the limitations to use in EVs, can be reduced. Metal-air batteries differ from normal batteries in that they are connected to air on the cathode side and work on the metal anode (Wang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2016; Zindani et al., \n2023; Boaretto et al., 2020). The difference between metal-air cells and fuel cells is that metal-air cells have a self-contained anode within the battery case (Asmare, 2022a, 2019; Asmare and Ilbas, 2020).

These batteries can dramatically lower prices by employing air as a cathode and inexpensive metals as an anode. These systems are also more energy and resource efficient due to the elimination of the need for oxygen (O2) storage, the use of more available materials, and improved safety (Wang et al., 2019, 2022a; Li et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2016; Zindani et al., 2023; Boaretto et al., 2020; Zou and Ben, 2022).

Thus, metal-air cells combine the best features of fuel cells and conventional batteries (Dobley, 2013). This approach offers a more cost-effective and efficient alternative to lithium batteries. \n\nFurthermore, the impacts of metal-air battery geometrical arrangements have been examined (Nie et al., 2022; Dubey et al., 2023; Park et al., 2022; Molenda, 2019). Given the rising use of irregularly shaped electrodes in flexible and extensible batteries, the effects of electrode shape on cell performance are being investigated (Nie et al., 2022). The square electrode has more uneven metal distribution than the circular electrode, resulting in more side reaction products and lower cycle performance. The electric field is extremely intense around the electrode edges, causing an uneven metal ion flow in the electrolyte. Park, Jeong, and Shin (Park et al., 2022) studied the influence of active material geometry on the tortuosity of the ion transport channel in an all-solid-state battery. The results showed that the active material's composition and form had a considerable influence on the ion transport properties, similar to that of a fuel cell (Kumuk et al., 2022). Dubey et al., (Dubey et al., 2023) investigate how modifying the geometry, including size and shape, impacts the thermal performance of LIB. The cooling performance of batteries has significantly declined due to their geometrical arrangement, similar to that of solid oxide fuel cells (Molla and Ilbas, 2020; Asmare, 2022b; Asmare et al., 2021). \n\nThe performance comparisons of various MABs in terms of nominal cell voltage and the theoretical gravimetric and volumetric energy density are illustrated in Fig. 1 (Zhang et al., 2016). \n\nSince oxygen is supplied directly from the environment and used as an oxidizing agent in the cathode during discharge time, MABs have a significantly higher energy density. Although LABs have the highest nominal cell potential (2.96 V), aluminium, zinc, and iron-air batteries are also research hotspots for economic and safety reasons. It is observed that lithium-air batteries rank first in theoretical gravimetric energy density, while aluminium and magnesium rank second and third, respectively. \n\nTable 1 also summarizes the key differences between the reported MABs.

{"doc_id": 259, "text": "Because of its abundance, geographical dispersion, and lower cost than lithium, zinc is appealing as a vital battery material. This energy storage technology is safe, and it makes use of abundant and environmentally friendly materials. Zinc is an abundant element in the earth's crust, and it has excellent stability, which is the primary reason for the increased interest in its development. In the 1930 s, primary (disposable) Zn-air batteries were commercialized and are now used in hearing aids, navigation lights, and railway signalling equipment. ZABs can be made into primary, electrically, and mechanically rechargeable batteries, with the latter being more convenient for refuelling and recycling (Mahlendorf et al., 2020; Koretz et al., 1996). However, the main disadvantages of these rechargeable batteries are low specific power and alkaline electrolyte carbonation (Wang and Xu, 2019; Sun et al., 2021). Practically, MABs are riddled with difficulties such as insufficient power density, coulombic, and back-and-forth efficiency. \n\nZinc-air batteries (ZABs) have high specific energy, affordability, advantages of abundant raw materials at low cost, environmental friendliness, safety, and a low production cost but they have limited cycle life. As a result, they have recently attracted renewed interest and research efforts as promising contenders for new applications in emobility (Fu et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2023; Yadav et al., 2022). ZABs are \n\nZinc-air batteries have been reconsidered in recent years due to their advantageous properties, such as high hypothetical energy density \n(1353 Wh/kg, disregarding oxygen), low cost (<100/kWh and possibly <$10/kWh), and safety. According to studies, the cost of rechargeable ZABs used in EVs is around $160/kWh, with the cost expected to drop to less than $10/kWh shortly, which is about two orders of magnitude lower than the cost of Li-ion batteries. This proves that the cost of EVs is falling, but there is uncertainty about the future costs of lithium-ion technology. Therefore, the development of Zn-air batteries should become an energy storage option for many applications such as EVs, power grids, and electrical appliances. Nykvist and Nilsson (Nykvist and Nilsson, 2015) have reviewed the status of EV batteries between 2007 and 2014 and indicate that it decreased by about 14 % per year, from more than $1000 per kWh to nearly $410 per kWh. Furthermore, battery pack cost used by market-leading BEV manufacturers is even lower, at 300$ per kWh, and has fallen by 8 % per year. However, improvements are still needed to produce viable rechargeable zinc-air batteries. These difficulties are caused by the low reduction oxygen reaction (ORR) and oxygen utilization reaction (OER) catalytic activity of current air electrodes (Li and Lu, 2017; Guo et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2021; Li and Dai, 2014a). In addition, their service life is still limited due to uneven Zn electrode dissolution or deposition, corrosion of Zn electrode materials, formation of solid carbonate deposits, evaporation, and dilution of electrolytes (Lu et al., 2019; Caramia and Bozzini, 2014; Chen et al., \n2018; Fu et al., 2017; Xu and Wang, 2019; He and Chen, 2022; Li and Dai, 2014b). However, research has shown that co-doping is an effective technique for improving the intrinsic catalytic performance of perovskites in MABs (Guo et al., 2019), (Nykvist and Nilsson, 2015). Zindani et al (Zindani et al., 2023). evaluated the performance of Mg-Al-Zn alloys as anode materials for metal-air batteries and found promising results. Peng et al., (Peng et al., 2023) systematically studied and evaluated the electrochemical performance of rechargeable ZABs using MnO2 as a bifunctional catalyst and various carbons such as carbon black, carbon nanotubes, and graphene as catalyst supports. The findings suggest that carbon nanotubes with superior crystallinity and low edge exposure are better candidates as catalyst supports compared with activated carbon and graphene. Ababay et al., (Worku et al., 2021) have also reviewed Zinc-air batteries' bifunctional electrocatalysts engineering and provided detailed explanations. Cui et al., (Cui et al., \n2023) also developed a bifunctional P-doped MoO2 (P-MoO2) catalysis to improve the performance of ZABs. P-MoO2 as cathode material exhibits excellent interaction between MoO2 and reduction oxygen reaction (ORR) as well as oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Choi et al., (Choi et al., 2023) also investigated the electrocatalytic activity of cobalt (Co) nanoparticles encapsulated in holey N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co-H-NCNTs) for ORR and OER and found that they were comparable to those of Pt/C and IrO2. Likewise, Co-H-NCNT is obtained as a promising bifunctional OER and ORR catalyst with excellent energy capacity, cycle durability greater than 300 cycles, excellent power density (207.0 mW/cm2), and stability electrocatalysis in Zn-air batteries. Khezri et al., (Khezri et al., 2020) investigated the effects of adding potassium persulfate to an alkaline electrolyte to improve the electrochemical properties of rechargeable ZABs. Their findings show that incorporating redox ingredients into electrolytes is an effective way to improve battery performance, as the battery exhibits a highly stable charge-discharge voltage for 800 cycles.

{"doc_id": 260, "text": "Zinc-air batteries could be much more affordable, lightweight, and energy-dense than Li-Ion batteries because air, one of the battery's main reactants does not need to be housed inside the battery, which allows more space for storage. Hence, many studies have been conducted to develop ZABs for electric vehicles. Unfortunately, zinc-air batteries are not currently commercially available for EVs due to charging difficulties, charge-discharge efficiency, discharge power, cycle life, and the strong corrosion affinity of Zn in acidic electrolytes, (Meng et al., 2022) (Lu et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2018; Xu and Wang, 2019; He and Chen, 2022). Zinc-air battery development is also slowed due to zinc's tendency to form dendrites after charge-discharge cycle repetitions, as well as low power outputs. At room temperature, ZABs have 200 Wh/kg energy density, which is approximately eight times that of conventional nickel-cadmium or Lead-Acid technology now used in electric vehicle applications. According to various studies, the cruising range of zinc-air batteries is at least twice that of lead-acid batteries with lower costs of the same volume (Ross, 1995). During battery discharge, the bifunctional air electrode absorbs oxygen while it emits oxygen in the opposite direction during charging (Worku et al., 2021). Rechargeable ZABs rely heavily on air (oxygen) electrodes that are bi-functionally active and durable enough to withstand harsh conditions during repetitive discharge and charge in alkaline electrolytes to achieve high power performance. They are promising because they have a higher energy density (gravimetrically 400–800 Wh/kg) and volumetrically (800–1400 Wh/L) than LIBs that have 150–280 Wh/ kg and 600–700 Wh/ L. ZABs can be manufactured for as little as 65$ per kWh to 135$ per kWh (Fu et al., 2017). Despite the extensive research and improvements discussed, existing electrically rechargeable ZABs still have a lot of room for improvement. \n\nEven though zinc-based batteries are cheap and readily accessible, they are currently unsuitable for long-term use in EVs due to the evolution of hydrogen (Liu et al., 2021) and the formation of dendrites ( \ntree-like internal structures) that limit the battery's cycle life (Stock et al., 2019). Aligned with the advancement of materials discovery, and innovation of device configuration, which significantly improved the cell's performance, including durability, operating voltage range, energy/power density, and economical availability, the development and commercialization of rechargeable aqueous Zn-ion batteries, Zn-Br2 flow batteries, Zn-MnO2 flow batteries, and Zn-based hybrid supercapacitors, has become a hot topic in recent years (Liu et al., 2021). \n\nZinc-ion rechargeable batteries(ZIBs) have recently attracted much attention as a promising alternative energy storage technologies because of their high theoretical capacity, high abundance of zinc, high safety, and low cost compared to LIBs, which are hazardous and expensive (Xu and Wang, 2019; Elia et al., 2021; Mallick and Raj, 2021). Mild aqueous electrolytes have shown great promise for use in portable electronics and large-scale energy storage systems. Yet, some obstacles prevent the development of these aqueous rechargeable batteries such as limited electrochemical operation, water's high causticity, the instability of electrode materials, the need for strong alkali electrolytes that cause unwanted side reactions, etc (Wu et al., 2019a; Xu and Wang, 2019; Boyd, 2018). In addition, sizable efforts have been dedicated to optimizing the structure and electrochemical performance of cathode materials. However, due to the strong electrostatic interaction and large steric hindrance effect between Zn-ions and host materials, it is still a challenge to explore suitable cathode materials to host Zn-ions (Wu et al., 2019a; Xu and Wang, 2019; He and Chen, 2022; Al-Amin et al., \n2022).

{"doc_id": 261, "text": "A zinc-air battery consists of a porous cathode and a zinc metal anode separated by an alkaline electrolyte. During discharge, molecular oxygen in the air penetrates the porous cathode and is reduced on the surface; at the same time, the metallic zinc anode is oxidized to soluble zincate (Zn (OH)4\n− 2) ions. In principle, this reaction is reversible as O2 evolves at the cathode and is released back into the atmosphere, and the metal Zn is plated at the anode. The operating system is based on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharge and the evolution of the reaction (OER) during charge. The main problem with this energy storage device is the slow kinetics of this reaction, which leads to meagre cycle life. Therefore, researchers around the world have focused their study on developing bifunctional materials suitable for oxygen electrocatalysts that are active during ORR and OER. \n\nNoble metals or transition metal oxides have been investigated and synthesized as the best-performing bifunctional catalysts; however, the use of inexpensive materials and beneficial carbon materials can help improve catalyst dispersion and active site while lowering the final catalyst cost. One of the advantages of these batteries is that they do not require lavish materials, e.g., carbon-based materials can be made from waste materials to be economical for the environment. Less attention has been paid to the Zn anode, which is equally important for the realization of sustainable and renewable Zn-air batteries. The primary issue is caused by hydrogen gas and the constant reaction of zinc and electrolyte, which causes the electrodes to corrode and the battery to fail. The environmental issue is driving the energy storage market for EVs and clean energy use. These applications require the development of higher energy than existing LIBs, the most widely used rechargeable batteries for portable devices and EVs. However, lithium-ion technology has limitations in terms of energy density, safety, and security, as well as a high cost per kilowatt hour, making it ineffective for large-scale use. \n\nRechargeable zinc-air batteries are good candidates as they have a good theoretical capacity of 1086 Wh/kg (energy delivered per kilogram battery), which is more than the 260 Wh/kg capacity of Li-ion batteries. They are also based on inexpensive, plentiful, and safe ingredients. However, secondary batteries still face some obstacles, which mainly affect the reversibility and lifetime of the electrodes (anode and cathode). \n\nThe primary issue with ZABs is that the zinc anode is very soluble. \n\nDuring discharge, the zinc electrode dissolves and erodes, but during charging, it hardens and produces dendrites on its surface. Excessively big dendrites can also come into contact with the cathode, resulting in a short circuit. They also cause bonding and electrode passivation, resulting in capacity loss and short battery life. Covering a zinc anode with nanoparticles, on the other hand, boosts the electrode's reversibility while also extending the lifespan of RZABs (Motlagh et al., 2023). \n\nFig. 2 depicts the basic operating principles of zinc-air batteries with an alkaline electrolyte. The generation of electrical energy in ZABs is due to the redox reactions that occur between the Zn metal and oxygen from the air. The electrolyte, which separates a porous cathode from a metallic zinc anode, is the battery's heart. During the discharge process, molecular oxygen from the surrounding air penetrates the permeable cathode and is reduced on the surface, whilst the zinc anode is oxidized to dissolvable zincate ions (Zn (OH)4\n− 2). In theory, this process is reversible since Zn is deposited as a metal in the negative electrode \n(anode), and molecular oxygen is created and released into the surrounding environment in the positive electrode (cathode). \n\nDespite the substantial study and improvements pointed out, existing electrical RZABs have a lot of room for advancement before being used in EVs and electronic gadgets. When RZABs discharge, external oxygen enters the battery and interacts at the gas-liquid-solid interface. The zinc electrode carries electrons to the air electrode via the external load, where they combine with OH- to create Zn (OH)4 2- and decompose into ZnO when their concentration reaches its maximum. During charging, a backward oxygen evolution process occurs at the zinc-electrolyte interface, storing electrical energy in chemical compounds and depositing zinc metal (Chen et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020; Kene and Olwal, 2023; Hardwick and De Leon, ´ 2018; Sun et al., 2019; Ponrouch et al., 2019).

The following is the chemical equation for RZAB (Alemu et al., 2023). \n\nMetal-air battery development is becoming increasingly imperative in the ongoing search for safe, environmentally friendly, compact, lowcost, lighter, and high-performance energy storage technology for powering automobiles, electronic devices, hearing aids, and an extensive range of utilities. Aligned with this, FABs are also being explored for use as rechargeable power sources in electric vehicles (Egashira, 2009). \n\nHowever, their results showed that the actual test cell's specific energy was only 10 % of the expected value. In addition, the large overpotential of the negative iron electrode causes a large amount of heat dissipation in this battery system. Fe-air batteries also have a hypothetical energy density of 763 Wh/kg and a cell voltage of 1.28 V. \n\nEnergy storage that is efficient, reliable, and cost-effective is required to increase the use of renewables and contribute to lowering the carbon footprint of the electricity grid. Trocino et al., (Trocino et al., 2019) have developed a novel iron-air battery with high performance, safety, and reliability for operation at intermediate temperatures (500–650 ◦C). The results prove that increasing the battery's durability and reliability \n\nSince the 1970s, FABs have been studied to develop inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and robust rechargeable batteries. The ironair system is well suited for many applications such as automobiles, with an estimated open circuit voltage of 1.28 V, a specific capacity of 300 Ah/kg, and reported efficiencies of 35 %, 40 %, and 96 % respectively for power voltage and charge. Many challenges need to be addressed to improve battery performance, including the efficiency and low cost of oxygen electrodes, low-cost metal electrodes that reduce corrosion and hydrogen formation, new battery designs using additive manufacturing techniques, and mathematical modeling (Mckerracher et al., 2015). Iron is an attractive metal for a rechargeable battery owing to its low cost, ease of oxidation, multiple oxidation states, and ability to be electrodeposited from an aqueous electrolyte. The iron-air cell can be thought of as a replacement for the iron-nickel oxide-alkaline cell, replacing the nickel electrode with a bifunctional air-breathing electrode. The iron-air battery has an open circuit cell potential of 1.28 V, \nwhich is slightly lower than that of iron-nickel oxide cells of 1.41 V, but replacing the nickel with an air-breathing electrode can upsurge the density of the energy by 100 % and the weight of the battery is reduced by one-third. As well, Iron-air batteries are also appealing because, unlike zinc batteries, they are less prone to dendrite formation. The rechargeable iron-air battery is formed by the reduction and evolution of oxygen at a catalyst-coated inert positive electrode and the negative iron electrode. However, enhancing battery performance requires tackling challenges like energy efficiency, low-cost metal electrodes, additive manufacturing processes, and mathematical modeling. Trocino et al., \n(Trocino et al., 2019) designed a unique FAB with outstanding performance, safety, and reliability at intermediate temperatures \n(500–650 ◦C). The results suggest that this battery improves longevity and reliability, particularly for low-temperature FABs, and no significant degradation was identified after more than 100 cycles. A high-temperature RFAB was investigated using ceramic electrolytes doped with strontium/magnesium and gadolinium-doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM) (Trocino et al., 2017). The strontium-doped lanthanum ferrite-cobaltite (LSFCO) perovskite electrode displayed high reversibility and low overpotentials for oxygen evolution and reduction processes. The CGO-based battery spontaneously discharged due to redox behaviour, whereas the LSGM-based battery demonstrated good cyclability features at 800 ◦C. However, a higher coulombic efficiency \n(about 42 %) is required for practical applications. In the power industry, a unique iron-air solid-state battery is also being tested for effective, long-lasting, and cost-efficient energy storage (Trocino et al., 2019). The battery employs a mixed conductivity lanthanum ferrite perovskite-based cathode, an oxygen anion-conducting lanthanum gallate electrolyte, and a composite iron-ceria anode. There are no nickel-electrode or hydrogen-water redox reactions as a result of this innovative design, which results in higher cyclability, good performance, and durability at 650 ◦C. X. Wu et al., (Wu et al., 2019b) also demonstrate sulphur electrodes as cathode material, but their utility is limited by polysulfide dissolution and shuttling in metal-sulphur redox chemistries. Combining an iron metal anode with a sulphur electrode allows for shuttling-free Fe-S electrochemical reactions. The sulphur electrode provides a novel way for rechargeable metal-sulphur batteries by reversing the Fe-S redox process and displaying good performance for Fe2+ storage.

These batteries were expected to have an open circuit cell voltage of 1.28 V and a hypothesized specific energy of 764 Wh/kg due to the production of Fe (OH)2. Iron electrodes were utilized in Ni/Fe batteries because they were affordable, widely available, and abundant, and were made from high-purity iron oxide powder (Hardwick, 2018). The study by Yaqoob et al., (Yaqoob et al., 2022) discusses the current state of metal-air batteries, highlighting their limitations such as low rate capacity, dendrite development, corrosion, and slow oxygen reaction kinetics. It also highlights the need for further development in material design strategies, electrodes, electrolytes, and separator selection. T. Li et al., (Li et al., 2020) found that FAB with nanocomposite electrodes has an energy density of 453 Wh/kg of Fe and a maximum charge capacity of 814 mAh/g of Fe. Zhao et al., (Zhao et al., 2012) \nreported an improved solid oxide iron-air battery with recharging capabilities.

As a result, during discharge, iron oxide is formed to protect the iron from rusting while charging, and the iron metal and the evolution of oxygen are regenerated. \n\nDuring the charge-discharge process of MABs, several intermediate species have been accomplished.

Inorganic and organic compounds are incorporated into the electrolyte to protect aluminium from corrosion. Organic additives reduce metal corrosion better, at a lower cost, and with less pollution than inorganic compounds (Zhang et al., 2022b; Sha et al., 2022; Zhai et al., 2022). Electrolytes are the building blocks of electrochemical cells, which help complete the reaction between the anode and cathode electrodes. When deciding which type of electrolyte to use, compatibility with working conditions should be carefully considered by analysing a variety of parameters including electrical conductivity, electrolyte stability, ionic conductivity, reactivity with the electrodes, volatility, and solution resistance (Farsak and Kardas¸, 2018). In addition to aluminium being an abundant and safe material, Al-air batteries also have high theoretical and specific energy values, making them another promising and intriguing candidate for advanced energy storage systems (Li et al., 2022; Arai and Hayashi, 2009; Chantavas, 2022; Arteaga-p et al., 2012) However, some scientific and technical issues that have been impeding the popularization and development of AABs have yet not been resolved (Li et al., 2022).

This macrocyclic graphite flake-based electrode also produces electrodes with higher specific capacitance, electrical conductivity, and surface charge. Das et al., (Das et al., 2017) reviewed the development challenges of aluminium-ion batteries.

Rechargeable AABs are promising contenders for their use as electric batteries to power electric and electronic devices, utility and commercial vehicles, and another usage at a relatively lower cost. Aluminium alloys are inexpensive and have good electrochemical performance compared to pure aluminium.

Aligned with this, a variety of metal-air chemistries are being studied (Hosaka et al., 2023; Zuo et al., 2020; Islam and Ghazal, 2023; Zhang et al., 2022a; Zindani et al., \n2023; Zhang et al., 2022b; Sha et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2019). For example, magnesium-air batteries are attractive due to the consistent deposition of magnesium metal, but aqueous magnesium-air batteries are limited by the corrosion of magnesium electrodes. Ionized liquid electrolytes were proposed for Mg-air systems, but they suffer from electrochemical instability, especially during charging, and the cell's reversibility is limited. These systems, however, are prone to corrosion and have not demonstrated adequate cycling stability. Mg-air and Al-air batteries have comparable energy densities to Li-air batteries. However, its low reduction potentials (–2372 V for Al and –1.662 V for Mg) allow rapid self-quenching from the hydrogen formation reaction (HER) (Liang and Ban, 2021). In addition, the electrodeposition of Mg and Al in aqueous electrolytes to fabricate rechargeable batteries is thermodynamically challenging. \n\nMg-air batteries have generated a great deal of interest in electrical energy storage systems due to their inherent perks such as low cost, high hypothetical volumetric power density, and environmental friendliness. They are still in the early stages of development, however, and suffer from high voltage polarization and poor cycling performance. At the moment, high-rechargeability Mg-air batteries are difficult to achieve, because the discharge products [Mg(OH)2, MgO, and MgO2] are thermodynamically and kinetically difficult to decompose at moderate voltage ranges (Wang et al., 2022b). As a result, optimizing the reaction paths and kinetics from the electrodes to the batteries using a combination of materials design and first-principles calculations is critical. \n\nUnderstanding basic batteries (electrochemistry) and electrolyte development is key to removing these barriers and bringing the technology closer to practical applications (Lu et al., 2021). Energy storage technologies are being researched to satisfy the energy demand. Lithium-ion batteries are technologically advanced, but their specific energies have reached a theoretical limit. Other battery chemistries, such as metal-air batteries, have become attractive because of their high theoretical energy. However, many problems remain unresolved, such as poor retraction and dendrite formation (Lu et al., \n2021). As a result, the popularity of alternative rechargeable batteries is snowballing swiftly due to new requirements for a variety of applications. The further development of batteries depends heavily on material innovations, which are accelerated by the involvement of multi-stakeholders and research institutions. Further research is expected to achieve a lifecycle target of more than 500 miles of cruise, less than half an hour of charging time, and more than 3000 times using rechargeable batteries to power electric vehicles. Despite the significant advances that have been made, MABs still face similar challenges as LIBs, especially for cathode materials. Thus, enhancing the reduction of oxygen reaction by doping, co-doping, or re-engineering base materials will require further work before large-scale commercialization. New material development for recycling batteries is also important since the operation of the entire requires integrated electronic equipment. Therefore, the development of more powerful batteries is an enduring process to fulfill the energy needs of everything from small electrical appliances to large vehicles and grid storage. It is strongly recommended that regular efforts be made to promote the development of better, more affordable, and safer battery technologies to accelerate the spread of electrically rechargeable batteries. \n\nAs indicated in Fig. 5, the anticipated electrochemical reactions of MgABs during the discharge-charge process are presented below \n(Asmare Alemu et al., 2023b): \nAnode half-reaction: Mg ⇌ Mg2+ +2e (20) \n\nAdvanced energy storage tools are essential for carbon reduction efforts. Batteries are one of the most versatile electrochemical energy storage systems and have the potential to impact the transition from the current climate catastrophe to a carbon-neutral and sustainable future. The ever-increasing demand for energy paves the way for sustainable and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, which are becoming increasingly popular, but their intermittent nature requires advanced electrochemical energy storage systems like MABs as a backup. In comparison with closed batteries, the open-air electrode results in a much greater battery connection with its surroundings, which is still poorly understood.

{"doc_id": 266, "text": "Rechargeable zinc-air batteries are nowadays being revisited as new spotlight research areas, but they are still suffering from different challenges to commercialization. Zinc electrodes suffer from serious issues such as dendrite growth, passivation, and hydrogen evolutional reactions during operation that limit their practical uses. These problems result in poor discharge performance, lower cycle, and shelf life. \n\nSalting, freezing, and loss of the electrolyte's solvent due to evaporation are also some of the common events observed in zinc-air batteries that future research will focus on. The development of electrodes and electrolyte materials using doping and co-doping that resist corrosion, deterioration (durable), dendrites, etc. coupled with comparable performance with the state-of-the-art LIBs are the critical research gaps to use such rechargeable batteries for future mobility. Despite their abundance, low cost, and high energy density, Zn-air batteries have been hindered by sluggish kinetics, charging difficulties, charge-discharge efficiency, zinc's tendency to form dendrites, lower discharge power, corrosion affinity in acidic electrolytes, and parasitic reactions. As a result, Zinc-air batteries are not commercially available for electric vehicles, so future research should focus on material development to commercialize safe, highly energetic, environmentally friendly, and affordable rechargeable batteries from zinc elements. Zinc elements are widely available and dispersed in all geographical areas. \n\nFurthermore, Iron is an attractive metal for a rechargeable battery due to its low cost, ease of oxidation, multiple oxidation states, less susceptibility to dendrite formation, and ability to be electrodeposited in an aqueous electrolyte. However, when compared to LIBs, the critical challenges of iron-air batteries are their large size, corrosion exposure, rechargeability issues, and long recharge times. Improving efficiency and developing low-cost bifunctional electrodes to reduce oxygen, reasonably priced iron electrodes to reduce corrosion and hydrogen evolution, new cell designs using additive manufacturing technologies, and mathematical modeling are all unresolved issues that require additional research. \n\nIn alkaline electrolytes, aluminium electrodes are highly corrosive, resulting in low Coulombic efficiency. Various studies have been conducted to address this issue, and it has been proposed that inorganic and organic compounds be added to the electrolyte. AABs have high theoretical and specific energy values, a volumetric capacity four times that of lithium, are low in cost, have a wide range of materials, and are safe, but it is crucial to identify the structural and electrochemical parameters of the cathodes and electrolytes. Cathode reduction oxygen reaction has always been dominated by platinum and other metal catalysts, but a few carbonaceous materials, transition metal oxides, and polymer-based systems would be good options. \n\nMg-air systems are appealing due to the homogeneous deposition of Mg metal, but aqueous Mg-air batteries are limited by Mg electrode Fig. 5. : Rechargeable magnesium-air battery working process (Wang et al., 2022c). \n\nGenerally, future research should concentrate on producing electrodes and electrolyte materials that are resistant to corrosion, degradation, and dendrites while keeping performance equivalent to that of today's lithium-ion batteries. Transition metals have played an important part in the development of rechargeable batteries as doping, codoping, electrodes, current collectors, biocatalysts, and other components. It is vital to decrease the shielding and repulsion forces that exist between components when comparable metal chemistries are utilized as inputs for electrodes, doping, co-doping, and biocatalysts. \n\nEnergy storage devices capture the energy and deliver it for future use, providing benefits such as improved power quality, stability, and reliability. Metal-air batteries have a higher theoretical energy density than LIBs and are often marketed as a next-generation electrochemical energy storage solution. The review found that rechargeable metal-air batteries are attractive for EV applications, with ZAB and FAB being the best options because of their cost and eco-friendly nature.

{"doc_id": 267, "text": "Due to issues with the metal anode, air cathode, and electrolyte, they are still far from practical uses. MABs still face challenges, especially for cathode materials, and more effort is needed to accelerate the reduction of oxygen reactions by doping, co-doping, or redesigning non-noble materials. These issues must be addressed before metal-air batteries become a viable option for large-scale deployment. The future of batteries is heavily reliant on material advancements, which are accelerated by the collaboration of many stakeholders and academic institutions. This is necessary to meet the energy needs of small to large vehicles and grid storage. Regular efforts should be made to develop better, more affordable, and safer battery technologies to accelerate the spread of electrically rechargeable MABs. New material development is also essential for battery updates, as electrochemically coordinated components are the foundation for the system's operation. Transition metals and carbon are crucial in developing rechargeable batteries, as are doping, co-doping, electrodes, current collectors, and biocatalyst materials. It's essential to reduce shielding and repulsion forces between components using similar metal chemistries. Therefore, future research should focus on producing electrodes and electrolyte materials resistant to corrosion, degradation, and dendrites while maintaining performance similar to LIBs. Also, reaching a range of more than 500 km, a charging time of less than half an hour, and a lifespan of more than 3000 cycles are future assignments.

It is only since the beginning of the 20th century that it has fallen into disuse due to the industrial production of concrete, steel and plastic materials. However, with global warming becoming undeniable, the societal challenge of decarbonizing transport may bring wood back into the spotlight. In this article, after a brief historical review, arguments about its availability and durability in a bio-economic context are put forward. The main mechanical properties of wood and plywood are then reviewed, along with the main factors influencing both their static and dynamic characteristics, the latter being important for the transport sector. Plywood is extensively detailed in this review paper, as it has been widely used in transport applications in the past, and presents potential optimized mechanical characteristics and eco-friendly resource utilization. Some mechanical models are also presented and put into perspective. A brief panorama of wood associations with natural or technical fibre composites is also proposed. Then, selected recent examples show that wood still has its place in naval, automotive, aeronautical, and even space applications. Finally, some conclusions are drawn and numerous research prospects in this vast and resurgent field are put forward. \n\nWood has been used for human mobility since very ancient times: for boats more than ten thousand years ago and when the wheel was invented. It is, in a way, the first bio-composite used by man in the field of transport. The first chariots are thought to have been created in the Eurasian Steppes in 4000 BCE [1], before the technology spread to Asia Minor, China [2] and as far as the Sahara, as attested by numerous pictograms [3]. One of the earliest illustrations of chariots can be seen on the banner of Ur (a site located in Mesopotamia, today's Iraq), dating from between 2700 and 2600 BCE and on display at the British Museum \n[4]. It clearly shows a Sumerian chariot pulled by equids known as \n\"kungas\", hybrids between female domestic donkeys and male hemippes, as horses had not been domesticated at the time [5]. One of the most famous uses of chariots is the Battle of Kadesh (1247 BCE) between the Hittites and the Egyptians, which involved several thousand chariots on both sides, making it probably the largest chariot battle in history (Fig. 1). Egyptian chariot technology was remarkable, as shown in the article by Rovetta et al. [6]. According to these authors, they were \"very similar to the technical and scientific principles used in machine mechanics with some of the modern concepts of today's applications\". The aim of the present article, however, is not to provide an exhaustive description of the use of wood in mobility over 6,000 years of human history, but rather to present, in the current context of ecological transition, the challenges of using this natural and renewable material for transport applications. Indeed, even though this use is not usually identified in studies, it fits naturally into the context of the bioeconomy and responds to the industrial decarbonization policies advocated by Europe [7]. Europe has set a target of reducing greenhouse gases by 80–95 % by 2050, compared to 1990 levels [8]. According to [7], \nEurope has defined a policy for the forestry industry, which aims, among other things, to promote rural development, energy efficiency, and the sustainable use of forest products. In particular, the aim is to develop \n\"new and innovative forestry and added-value products\". On this last point, using wood in the transport sector could be the best candidate strategy for meeting this political and societal objective. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0263822323011364-main.md"}

Composition of forest stands in metropolitan France [10]. \n\nRoundwood production in Europe was 507 million m3 (with 69 % conifers). Production is now 25.6 % more than at the beginning of 2000. \n\nThe total resource is estimated at 28.3 billion m3. Production is therefore 1.78 %, which is perfectly sustainable. The stocks of timber in forests increased in every Member State, giving a 30.6 % growth at EU level in the period of 2000–2020, which is more than the amount harvested. \n\nThe total area of woodland in Europe is 159 million hectares, which means that 39 % of the EU is covered with forests. In the case of France, forest cover has been steadily increasing over the last century [10]. In 1840, it represented 8.9 million hectares, by 1908 it had become 10 million hectares, and, today, the French forest covers 31 % of the territory with 17.0 million hectares. Forest cover in France has therefore more than doubled in 180 years. The post-war rural exodus and agricultural revolution, the afforestation of land supported by the National Forestry Fund (1947–1999: 2 million hectares planted) and ongoing reforestation in mountainous areas have all contributed to this expansion. Since 1985, when forest cover stood at 14.1 million hectares, growth has been sustained at almost 80,000 ha per year. Metropolitan France's forests are predominantly hardwood, accounting for 67 % of the total forest area (9.9 million hectares). The volume of standing timber in metropolitan France is 2.8 billion cubic meters. The stock of standing timber has risen sharply, from 1.8 billion cubic meters in 1985 to 2.8 billion cubic meters today. That means an increase of almost 50 % \nin just thirty years! The annual volume of abstractions averaged 50.1 million cubic metres (Mm3) per year over the period 2011–2019, or 1.78 % of the resource. On average, 24.2 Mm3 of hardwood and 25.9 \n\nMm3 of coniferous trees are cut down each year. In metropolitan France, annual mortality averaged 10.0 +/-0.4 Mm3/year over the period 2011–2019, or 0.4 % of the resource. Mortality has increased by 35 % in recent years. This increase is due, in particular, to repeated dry periods and climatic conditions favourable to xylophagous insects, notably bark beetles. \n\nGermany, Europe's largest wood producer, has similar figures [11]. \n\nIn Germany, woods cover an area of approx. 111 billion m2, about 31 % of the entire country. Thus, with approx. 3.4 billion m3, Germany has one of the biggest timber resources in Europe. In addition, this amount increases by about 107 million m3 every year whilst the total annual cut is about 56.8 million m3 (mean value of the years 2003 to 2012). Sustainability is embedded safely in the German forest management values. \n\nThus, the cultivation and cut cannot be increased to an endangering limit, even if the demand for wood should increase. Another welldocumented example is the USA. It is the world's 4th largest country in terms of forest cover, which occupies 33 % of its territory. Forest cover has remained generally stable over the last 100 years [12]. While U.S. forest land area remains stable, the current forest inventory (volume) has increased by ~ 60 % (Fig. 3b) from 1963 because of higher growth (about 3 % per year) and lower removal (about 1.5).

{"doc_id": 273, "text": "A priori, the impact of global warming on European forests is expected to have contrasting effects [13]. A significant reduction in productivity is expected in Mediterranean regions, due to increased drought and fire risk. Climatic risks (storms, droughts, fire and floods) are also increasing across the continent. However, it seems possible that other forests will grow faster by absorbing more CO2, expanding northwards or to higher altitudes, and creating more summer wood. \n\nAccording to [10], \"Utilizing such benefits, even if they are only of temporary nature, could increase the adaptive capacity of the sector and support long-term adaptation and innovation to better cope with climate change.\". \n\nAlthough the overall resource is increasing in the northern hemisphere, it is decreasing dramatically in the southern hemisphere. To illustrate this point, we can focus on the case of Madagascar. In this country, the forest has shrunk by 40 % since 1950 [14], leading to further soil degradation [15]. Rajemison [16] reports the direct causes of deforestation are conversion to agricultural land, the local collection of wood for energy, and clearing for pasture. Indirect causes include changes in export prices for wood products, migration and land ownership. For Madagascar, the main direct factors contributing to this loss of forest cover are agricultural clearing, fires and irrational exploitation. Deforestation and resource degradation are essentially due to these causes, which generally relate to goods such as timber and nontimber products, forest space as an economic production medium for agriculture and livestock farming, and forest subsoil through mining. \n\nAdded to these is the proliferation of illegal harvesting in the country in recent years, which has led to significant degradation of resources. The development of this type of activity can be explained by the growing demand for wood on internal and external markets. In addition to this decline in the productive potential of Madagascar's forests, there are also major threats to forest resources. The causes are the degradation of exploitable areas, amplified by the population's growing need for wood products, which is keeping pace with demographic growth (2.8 % per year) and market requirements. The causes of deforestation identified in the case of Madagascar can be generalized [14–16] as: demographic factors, institutional factors, local economic factors, the type of local resource and wood extraction (mainly fuelwood for local use), and the expansion of agriculture. Nevertheless, the cases of countries and continents are very diverse. For example, there has been virtually no decrease in forest cover in Gabon in recent years [17]. More detail on the impact of global warming on tropical forests can be found in the latest 2022 report by the IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change) [277]. \n\nIn conclusion, there is great potential in Europe for the use of wood in innovative applications, as the resource exists and is largely available. \n\nToday's wood production flows in Europe can be seen in Fig. 3 [7,18]. It can be noted, for instance, that 31.1 % of production is dedicated to the paper industry, while worldwide use of wood has reached a plateau and is declining. Wood therefore offers the dual advantage of being able to store carbon both during his life and once it has been harvested and used, as well as being easily recyclable or reusable for new uses in a cascading logic: recycled solid wood can be used to manufacture particleboard, which in turn can be used in the chemical industry, and ultimately in the wood energy sector. [7,18]. At the end of the cycle, 60 % of it is used as wood energy (see Fig. 3). Numerous research projects are currently focusing on the industrial use of wood as part of a circular economy. \n\nAn additional benefit is the low energy cost of processing wood compared with other materials, as shown by Kohl et al. [11], Fig. 4. \n\nFinally, increased use of wood enables better CO2 sequestration, as shown by Negro et al. [19] for the furniture and construction industry. For an average European dwelling, the quantity of carbon stored is estimated at 3531 kg, which corresponds to the CO2 emitted by about 3 cars driving 10,000 km in a year and emitting 120 g of CO2 per km. The fact that it is also a local resource and essentially processed locally greatly reduces the need for transport, which induces a positive feedback. Studies, such as that by Bergman et al. [20] on the CO2 impact of wood use, conclude that, in all the cases they studied, \"The reduced carbon emission impacts associated with woody biofuel use and storage of carbon in long-lived wood products result in lower net carbon emissions of wood products compared with non-wood product alternatives\".

{"doc_id": 274, "text": "For the cases they evaluated, \"the combined GHG emissions reductions due to biofuel usage, carbon storage, and avoided fossil emissions are always greater than the wood product manufacturing carbon emissions\". However, the authors point out that this result is only valid in the case of rational forest use. In [21], Peskinen et al. summarize 51 studies on substitution factors. They conclude that \"Overall, the 51 reviewed studies suggest an average substitution effect of 1.2 kg C / kg C, which means that, for each kilogram of C in wood products that substitute nonwood products, there occurs an average emission reduction of approximately 1.2 kg C\". \n\nAll in all, while detailed studies are needed on the potential impact of widespread use of wood in means of transport, the authors venture to consider the wood-based family car as an additional piece of furniture or part of the frame of the house. This use seems compatible with the scenarios for the use of forest resources in Europe (high, medium or low mobilization scenario [9]). \n\nWood is a natural material with three main functions: conduction of sap, mechanical support of the tree, and reserve tissue. As a natural material made by a living tree, wood is heterogeneous and variable at different scales. So, it is important to study it at several scales in order to understand its macroscopic mechanical properties. By its very nature and mode of growth, the tree is an oriented heterogeneous material, with a main stiffness direction along the fibre direction (main axis of the tree). To describe it, we shall use three main directions (see Fig. 5) in a cylindrical coordinate system: \n- the longitudinal direction (L), which corresponds to the main axis of the trunk, \n- the tangential direction (T), corresponding to the growth-ring axis, - the radial direction (R), perpendicular to the other two directions (L \nand T), and therefore oriented from the pith to the bark. \n\nThese directions give rise to three planes that can be seen in Fig. 5 to describe the internal structure of the wood: the transverse plane (RT) formed by the radial and tangential directions, the radial plane (LR) oriented by the longitudinal and radial directions, and the tangential plane (LT) defined by the longitudinal and tangential directions. \n\nThere are two main classes of tree: hardwood and softwood: \n\nOn a macroscopic scale, wood is made up of several elements, listed from the inside out in [23]: \n- the heartwood, also known as \"perfect wood\", in which all cells are dead. This is the central part of the tree, contributing to its rigidity. It is also what is generally sought after in industry, \n- sapwood or newly-formed wood, in which the parenchyma cells are alive. It may be lighter (with a few exceptions) or darker in colour than the heartwood depending on the wood species, in which case the sapwood is said to be differentiated, \n- the cambium, made up of a set of generative cells that allow the wood to grow, \n\nThese elements can be seen in Fig. 6, which shows a cross-section of a tree trunk. \n\nIn temperate regions, during wood formation, there is a difference between wood formed in spring, called earlywood, and that formed in summer, called latewood. Spring wood needs larger cells for the transport of nutrients and water by the sap, so it will be lighter and less dense than summer wood, which has thinner cells because the need for nutrients and water is less at the end of the growing season. These two kinds of woods form an overlapping cylindrical layer known as the annual ring or growth ring. There is also a difference between juvenile wood (the rings closest to the core), which is less rigid, and mature wood (the rings closest to the bark). Those elements, regarding engineering wood products as shown by Rahayu et al. [24] have shown that, in the case of poplar, the stiffness and elastic modulus of plywood or veneers made from mature wood are 15 to 20 % higher, on average, those that of panels or veneers made from juvenile wood. This was also shown by Gaborik and Kacerova on poplar LVL made with juvenile and mature wood [25]. In addition to the heterogeneity of mechanical properties, wood density can differ significantly between initial and final wood for certain species (Table 1).

{"doc_id": 275, "text": "The wood cells are oriented, either longitudinally for sap conduction and mechanical support, or radially for nutrients transport and reserve. The latter are known as wood rays. The microstructures of hardwoods differ from those of softwoods [22]. The cells that make up wood are mainly composed of celluloses (40 %), hemicelluloses (30 %) and lignin \n(30 %) [27]; the relative percentages change slightly depending on the wood species considered. Cellulose, in the form of microfibrils, acts as reinforcement. Hemicelluloses and lignin act as the matrix in which cellulose is found [26]. \n\nThe cell wall is made up of the following elements, visible in Fig. 7: - the middle lamella, which acts as intercellular cement. It is common to two neighbouring cells and is non-fibrillar. It contains no cellulose, \n- the primary wall made up of a network of cellulose microfibrils, making it extensible, \n- S1 secondary wall, where cellulose fibrils are horizontal, \n- S2 secondary wall, where the cellulose fibrils, namely the microfibrils, are almost vertical and all parallel. This is the thickest wall, and therefore has the greatest influence on the wood's mechanical properties. The angle formed by these fibrils is called the micro-fibril angle \n(MFA). The smaller the angle, the stiffer the wood. This explains the difference in flexibility between juvenile and mature wood [28]. \n\nTable 2 Elastic mechanical characteristics of some softwoods and hardwoods [22]. \n\nSoftwood Hardwood \n\nProperties Pine Fir Sequoia Poplar Balsa Birch Moisture contents \n\nDensity (g/cm3) 0.51 0.35 0.38 0.46 0.16 0.62 \n\nEL (MPa) 12,300 10,000 9,200 10,900 34,000 13,900 ER (MPa) 959.4 390 818.8 468.7 510 695 \n\nET (MPa) 1389.9 1020 800.4 1002.8 1564 1084.2 GRL(MPa) 996.3 580 708.4 752.1 1258 945.2 GRT(MPa) 1008.6 700 607.2 817.5 1836 1028.6 \n\nGTL(MPa) 159.9 60 101.2 119.9 170 236.3 \n\nDue to its structure, presented in the previous paragraph, on the scale of a thin wooden board, wood behaves as an orthotropic material in the reference frame ( L\n→, T\n→, R\n→). Its elastic behavior is thus represented by the following symmetrical Hooke's stiffness matrix: \n\nDue to the symmetry of the matrix: νLR\nEL = νRL\nER , νLT\nEL = νTL\nET and νRT\nER = νTR\nER . \n\nThis explains why, expressed in the orthotropic reference, the stiffness matrix is resumed by only nine independent elastic constants. The properties of wood depend on the direction of stress, and also on the species, through the ligneous plane and therefore the microstructure specific to each species. For many species, certain stress directions offer better mechanical properties: for the moduli of elasticity: EL >> ER > ET , for the shear moduli: GRL > GTL > GRT, and, for the Poisson's ratios, νTR > νLT > νRL > νRT > νLR > νTL. Table 2 presents the elastic constants of some species of wood. \n\nThe strength of wood also depends on the sign of the stress. There is a significant difference in stress at the break between tensile and compressive stresses. Overall, tensile strength is twice as high as compressive strength in the L-axis, but tensile strength in the L-axis is a quarter of the compressive stress in the T- or R-axis. It is also important to note that, in compression, wood exhibits significant deformation: it behaves like a ductile material, which is not the case in tension, where wood is considered as a brittle material (Fig. 8). The dispersion of these properties remains significant due to the heterogeneity of the wood material. Table 3 shows the mechanical strengths of various wood species in relation to different mechanical stresses. These mechanical properties differ from one species to another, but also within the same species [24]. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0263822323011364-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 276, "text": "The failure mode in tension is generally brittle, whereas the modes of failure in compression and shear are more complex. Depending on the direction in which the wood is loaded in compression (longitudinal, radial or tangential), its failure scenario differs, in line with the wood's orthotropy. For longitudinal loading (L), three successive phases are observed (Fig. 8), which are very common in cellular structures (foam, honeycombs [33,34]): \n- an initial elastic phase in which stress evolves linearly with strain; the modulus of elasticity in tension is equal to that in compression, \n- a load peak followed by a drop in stress, corresponding to local buckling of the wall, and then a progression of the buckling wave, \n- a region of consolidation and densification, where stress increases sharply. The lobes of the buckled walls are superimposed (Fig. 8). \n\nWhen wood is subjected to radial (R) or tangential (T) compression, the stress–strain curves are similar (Fig. 8), but the failure mechanisms are different. This explains why the stiffness of wood under this type of \n\nFig. 8. Typical stress–strain curve for wood loaded in tension and compression [22]. \n\nTo conclude this overview of the usual mechanical properties of wood, it is noteworthy that a crucial mechanical property for the development of structured materials is the specific stiffness, i.e. stiffness \n(Young's Modulus) divided by density. \n\nThis is of even greater concern for the design of parts intended to be integrated into vehicles, where minimization of the overall mass is primordial. Regarding this criterion, wood performs very well thanks to its low density and average mechanical properties. It has high rigidity/ density and strength/density ratios when loaded parallel to the grain and a rigidity/density3 ratio higher than most other mechanical construction materials (the last ratio being related to the flexural modulus per unit mass). Fig. 10 illustrates the position of wood among other usual materials, in the form of an Ashby diagram [40], commonly used today for material selection. \n\nAlthough studies have been carried out on the creep of wood, particularly in view of its use in construction, few have focused on the mechanical fatigue of this material. On the other hand, many studies have focused on the thermo-hydric fatigue of wood and the influence of humidification/drying cycles on the mechanical strength of structures. It is also noticeable that some wood aircraft manufactures claims that their wood structures is insensitive to fatigue [258]. \n\nThe linear relationship between the mechanical properties of wood and its density is reliable [23]. As will be seen later for moisture content and temperature, corrective formulas can be used to determine wood properties for a given density. Moduli of elasticity can then be calculated from a wood's density as shown in Table 4. \n\nWhen the humidity of the ambient air is close to 100 % and the temperature is around 20 ◦C, the wood tends to stabilize around a moisture content called the \"Fibre Saturation Point\" (FSP). FSP is around 30 % for almost all wood species. Since the moisture content of wood influences its mechanical properties, the literature generally gives the characteristics of wood for a reference moisture content of 12 %, corresponding to the average moisture content of wood in use (inside building etc.); to simplify, this moisture content of 12 % is generally observed for external conditions of 65 % RH and 20 ◦C. When the moisture content of the wood is below the FSP, there is an effect of the moisture content on the mechanical properties of the wood, i.e. fracture B.

Fig. 16 illustrates the main deformations that can be observed when the moisture content of wood boards varies. \n\nWood is a material sensitive to biological degradation agents. \n\nExcessive ambient humidity leads to biodegradation and numerous pathologies affecting the mechanical properties of wood. These organisms, whether wood-eating insects *(larvae or adults)* or fungi, feed on cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. However, if properly processed, wood is a highly durable material, as evidenced by the timber frames in many very old buildings. 2.3.1.2. *Temperature.* The cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin that make up wood are biopolymers, composed of macromolecules and derived from low-molecular-weight molecules. A polymer is a substance which has a molecular structure built up chiefly or completely from a large number of similar units bonded together. Biopolymer used to designate polymers derived from biomass and therefore produced by living organisms. Polymers and biopolymers have a temperature that defines the transition from a glassy (solid) state to a rubbery state. The latter temperature is called the glass transition temperature, usually noted Tg. It depends, for example, on the nature of the wood and its species, the density of the wood or its relative humidity [23] and, as for common polymers (wood being composed of biopolymers), on the speed of solicitation (or dynamic excitation) for instance during dynamic mechanical tests (Hopkinson bar, vibrational, AFM, etc.). In addition, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin have their own glass transition temperatures. \"The glass transition temperature is 40 ◦C for hemicelluloses, 50 ◦C to 100 ◦C for lignin, and above 100 ◦C for cellulose [41,42]. At constant moisture content and below 150 ◦C, the mechanical properties of wood are approximately linearly related to the temperature. Below 100 ◦C, a rapid temperature change will result in essentially reversible property changes [32]. At a constant moisture content, an increase in temperature causes a reduction in the mechanical properties of the wood by softening it. The curves in Fig. 17 show the relationship between elastic modulus and stress at break in relation to wood temperature. Corrective coefficients such as those proposed by Palka et al. \n\nWhen temperatures are high and wood is exposed to them for long periods, irreversible effects are observed on its mechanical properties. \n\nThese include loss of mass and stiffness, degradation of the wood constituents, and the creation of a charcoal layer on the material outer shell. \n\nThese irreversible degradations depend on factors such as wood moisture content, temperature, exposure time, heat source, species and sample size (Fig. 18). This point should be borne in mind, for example, when bonding composite or metal skins to wooden cores [44]. \n\nLaminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) is made of thin sheets of wood, called veneers, joined together with an adhesive. They are manufactured\n\nE\nby two means, rotary peeling or splitting, and their fibres are mainly oriented in a single direction, leading to sheets mainly in the LT plane for the rotary peeled ones, and in the L, with a mix of R and T, plane for the spit ones. Wood laminates can be cross-ply laminated, meaning that longitudinal and transverse veneers alternate throughout the laminate. When the main orientations of the veneers alternate, this laminate can be referred to as plywood.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0263822323011364-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 278, "text": "Because of the way it is manufactured and the possibility of removing defects by choosing the veneers that make it up and their orientation, LVL has mechanical properties that are comparable or even superior to those of solid wood while, at the same time, reducing the dispersion of its mechanical properties. The reduction in the variability of wood mechanical properties can be explained by a better volumetric distribution (random or eventually optimized [CC]) of its natural defects,\n\nFig. 20, in plywood, by comparison with solid wood, the discrepancy can be diminished while the mechanical properties can be increased. Veneers are manufactured by peeling logs (Fig. 21). Between two veneers, also known as a ply, an appropriate resin or adhesive (such as epoxy, phenol, formaldehyde, melamine, urea formaldehyde, polyethylene, reactive polyurethane, etc.) is incorporated. The manufacturing process involves steps such as steaming, uncoiling, ply drying, ply positioning and orientation, gluing, pressing and planing. In some cases, laminates are manufactured under heat, with press temperatures of around 140 ◦C, \nto ensure that the thermoplastic adhesive fuses in the heated press. The panel is then cooled to room temperature and pressurized to prevent twisting or warping of the laminate due to thermal expansion and the internal stresses associated with uneven cross-layer deformation. Fig. 22 shows a peeling machine and Fig. 23 shows the manufacturing process and the final structure of the LVL. Once the wood panel has been obtained, it is cut to the desired dimensions [55]. \n\nThe peeling process is a complex machining process that has a significant effect on the quality and condition of the veneers, and therefore on the resulting LVL. This involves machining in 0–90 T mode as shown in Fig. 24 (where the first number corresponds to the angle between the edge of the tool and the grain of the wood, the second to the angle between the direction of the cut and the grain of the wood, and the last to the direction of the cut - nomenclature proposed by McKenzie to describe the methods of cutting wood [55]). This cut of the wood makes it possible to limit the cutting forces while lowering the damage to veneers. \n\nTo optimize veneer production using the peeling process, a wide range of settings need to be taken into consideration, depending on the species and the type of veneer to be produced: the geometric parameters of the peeling tools, cutting speed, log steaming temperature, and eccentricity also have an impact on veneer quality. Tools and their geometries play a key role in the peeling process. In particular, the knife has a cutting angle of between 18◦ and 22◦. To prevent premature damage, the edge can be locally reinforced with a micro-bevel or rounded. The tool clearance angle, which remains the main setting for this part, is variable during the peeling process. The angle increases from a positive value at the start of the process to form a chip as quickly as possible, then stabilizes before decreasing at the end of the cut to limit log vibration [56,57,58]. \n\nAnother device, the pressure bar, complements the knife in the peeling process. It creates a stress field by compressing the wood so as to limit the appearance of peeling cracks (see next subsection and Fig. 27). \n\nThe pressure bar has a beak angle greater than 90◦, so that the stress field is upstream of the knife. The rate of compression applied to the wood depends on the horizontal position of the bar. For veneer peeling, compressions ranging from 10 % to 20 % of the veneer thickness are generally used [56,57,58]. Log temperature is also a parameter to be considered when manufacturing veneers. Some species, such as poplar, can be peeled at room temperature or even frozen (poplar), but others require the logs to be steamed (beech, Douglas fir). Wood that is too cold will produce cracked, rougher veneers, while wood that is too hot will produce \"fluffy\" veneers. The ideal peeling temperature, providing the best veneer qualities, is specific to each species and some authors suggest that the Tg plays a role in that phenomenon [59]. To obtain the desired temperature before machining, the log is steamed in saturated steam or boiled in hot water. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0263822323011364-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 279, "text": "Log eccentricity also influences veneer quality and a log centred on its core will produce veneers of better quality than an eccentric log (Fig. 25) [60] . When peeling a centred log, the knife will pass over a longer distance through locally homogeneous wood (summer wood, summer/spring wood transition, spring wood, spring/summer wood transition). However, this recommendation to centre on the core runs counter to the practices of veneer manufacturers who, to optimize material yield, look for the geometric centre of the log rather than its core. Furthermore, the quality of a veneer differs according to its distance from the log centre. This is explained by the difference in mechanical properties between juvenile and mature wood. It should be remembered that mature wood is more rigid and stronger than juvenile wood. The mechanical properties of the veneer are therefore influenced by where, in the radius of the log, the veneer was extracted.\n\nThese cracks, generally referred to as lathe checks, which occur during the peeling phase ( Fig. 26 ) and run parallel to the veneer fibres, are characterized in the literature by two parameters: their spatial frequency (or distance between two cracks), and their average depth [61] .\n\nA third parameter can be introduced: the angle formed between the surface of the veneer and the crack path within the veneer thickness (sometimes the crack path can suddenly change its direction, creating two distinct angles of propagation). The main factor influencing the crack formation, for a specific wood species, is the thickness of the unwound veneer: the thicker the veneer, the deeper, but less frequent, the cracks (Fig. 26) [62,63,64]. However, veneer thickness is not the only parameter to be considered when characterizing crack formation; other parameters, such as the local density of the wood, the log steaming temperature before peeling, the pressure bar compression ratio, the peeling radius, and the peeling speed, also have a greater or lesser influence. \n\nLathe checks have a non-negligible effect on the mechanical properties of a veneer. The deeper they are (and therefore the less frequent they are), the lower are the elastic moduli and stresses at break. The effect of cracks is mainly studied at the LVL scale in the literature. Using tensile tests parallel and perpendicular to the grain of a 5-ply LVL, Bekhta et al. [66] show that the presence of cracks, and especially their depth, leads to a reduction in the stresses at fracture of LVL compared with solid wood. They found a reduction of around 23.7 % in stress at break in the longitudinal direction and 86.9 % in the transverse direction. This loss of properties can also be observed in the longitudinal and shear elastic moduli of LVL, due to the depth of the cracks [67,68,69]. Crack orientation and position play an important role in the properties of laminated timber, particularly in the case of shear stresses. Rohumaa et al. [70] show the effect of crack depth and the direction in which cracks are loaded (crack-opening or crack-closing shear) on the shear strength of their plywood (Fig. 27). \n\nThe way in which the plies are bonded together, and therefore the positioning of the cracked faces in relation to the sound faces, also has a bearing on the shear properties of LVL (Fig. 28). The worst case is when the cracked faces are bonded together, and the best case is when the sound faces are bonded opposite to each other [71]. In industry, the faces of LVL panels are bonded so that the cracked faces face the sound faces [72]. \n\nPot et al. propose [73] a finite element model (FEM) to describe and to analyse the influence of veneer lathe checks on the elastic properties of LVL. The results show that the longitudinal modulus of elasticity is marginally affected by checking, while the shear rigidity of the LVL \nbeam is significantly reduced in edgewise bending if checks are not glued. Gluing checks, even with a glue of low Young's modulus, strongly reduces the effect of checking on the global elastic mechanical properties of LVL. \n\nDuring the LVL manufacturing process, the use of pressure to bond veneers can tend to densify them. Densification occurs when the density of the veneer is artificially modified. Wood, and therefore wood veneers, can be mechanically densified in order to increase their stiffness and stress at failure. This process can also be carried out prior to LVL \nmanufacture to improve certain properties of the final laminate. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0263822323011364-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 280, "text": "Densification is a means of improving the mechanical properties of wood up to a maximum density of around 1.5 g/cm3, which corresponds to the cell wall density of dry wood [32]. Transverse or radial compression allows a significant reduction in cell void volume and is the most frequently used method for densifying wood. Wood densification can take place in several stages [54]: \nSoftening of the cell wall: wood can be heated to a temperature above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of its amorphous polymers \n(hemicellulose and lignin) (160 to 200 ◦C [74]), \nCompression phase, Drying of compressed wood to improve dimensional stability, Fixation of compressed wood. The densification achieved under these conditions is, however, partly reversible if the wood is re-exposed to high humidity [75]. \n\nNumerous densification processes to improve the mechanical properties of wood-based composites have been developed since the beginning of the twentieth century. However, we will deal with thermomechanical densification only, here, which most closely resembles the veneer densification observed when bonding plies under press for LVL \nmanufacture. In this process, the softening of the wood can be initiated by the rise in temperature if the LVL is hot-pressed prior to the application of a compressive force in the transverse or radial direction [76]. \n\nThis densification has an effect on the mechanical properties of LVL, \nsince ply densification increases the stiffness as well as the stress at break of LVL in bending, tension and compression [66,77,78,79]. Table 5 summarizes the tensile stresses at break of 1.5 mm birch and alder veneers. Tensile stress at break is higher for densified veneers than for nondensified veneers in the case of fibre-direction tension. For tensile tests perpendicular to the fibre, densified veneers have a lower stress at break \n[66]. \n\nOther methods for densifying veneers include processes. These processes overcome the drawback that, in a simple thermo-mechanical compression process, densified wood largely recovers when re-exposed to high humidity and temperature [75]. In the case of thermo-hydromechanical densification, wood samples are softened with steam, \n\nBonding is a crucial step in the manufacture of LVL. The choice of glue and the quantity used have an effect on the properties of LVL. What is more, in engineered wood products, glue does not just create an interface, in may affect the global stiffness and strength of the final product compared to solid wood. In the case of glued wood joints, three different zones can be clearly identified: the adhesive-only interface \n(orange line in Fig. 29), an interface in which the wood cells are partially filled with adhesive (yellow zones in Fig. 29), and solid wood clear of any glue (Fig. 29) [83,84]. Knowing the elastic properties of wood and adhesive, the elastic properties of the interface can also be calculated by applying simple mixture theory. In all cases, penetration of the adhesive into the wood leads to an increase in local stiffness and the formation of a wood-adhesive composite [85,86]. \n\nMany parameters play a part in the adhesion performance between wood and glue: the formulation and type of glue, the quality and quantity of adhesives used, the gluing pressure applied, the heating temperature during pressing, the thickness of the glue joint, the penetration of the glue into the wood, and so on. However, it is important to note that it is impossible to compare the adhesion performance of different types of glue on the basis of glue penetration alone. Penetration may have only a secondary effect on adhesion performance, whereas the effects of cohesive strength or covalent bonds, which will differ depending on the adhesive formulation, may have a greater impact [88]. \n\nIn the case of LVL, glue penetration into peeling cracks and damaged cells on the ply surface improves adhesion performance. In addition, penetration promotes better stress distribution between the adherends when they are subjected to load [88]. \n\nIt should be noted, however, that the thickness of the glue joint and the penetration of the glue into the wood depend on several parameters, such as the amount of glue put between two veneers, often referred to as GS (for \"Glue Spread\") rate; the pressure at which the veneers are glued; ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0263822323011364-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 281, "text": "It should be noted, however, that, in the case of LVL, higher pressure during gluing not only enhances glue penetration, but also densifies the veneers. Both phenomena have an effect on the mechanical properties of LVL. Table 6 summarizes the mechanical properties of LVL and the thickness of the glue joint versus the pressure used during LVL pressing (from [79]). Compression ratio is defined as the percentage reduction in the sample dimension in the radial direction per its initial value [279]. \n\nAs shown earlier, the peeling of a log is complex and generates a slope of the grain, which has an influence on the mechanical properties of the wood material. A non-zero fibre orientation in the direction of stress weakens the wood and the veneers. On solid wood, Kollmann [26] \nobserved that a deviation of 15◦ from the load axis resulted in an almost 50 % reduction in tensile stress at break (Fig. 31). \n\nIn the case of veneers, fibre deflection has been shown to be one of the most influential properties affecting tensile stress at break. However, measuring this deflection is not easy. Several non-destructive measurement methods exist to measure the grain angle but these methods are not infallible and have their advantages and disadvantages. It should also be borne in mind that grain angle deviation does not occur solely in the plane, and that it could display an out-of-plane component, as illustrated in Fig. 32. \n\nIt is possible to use fracture criteria to calculate an equivalent fracture stress as a function of the grain angle. A widely used criterion in the wood characterization literature is Kollmann's criterion, which is described below [26]: \n\nFig. 27. Intermediate ply with crack opening (a) Intermediate ply with crack closure (b) Failure of plywood in crack opening (c) Failure of plywood in crack closure \n\nFig. 28. Three different LVL bonds for shear tests [71]. \n\nKollmann's formula can be generalized to calculate many mechanical parameters based on wood grain deviation. Table 7 summarizes the values of n according to the properties studied and also the values of the ratio σt/σl calculated in the literature for solid wood [22]. If the formula is generalized to other mechanical properties, σl and σt are no longer the breaking stresses, but the properties studied in the longitudinal and transverse directions. \n\nAlthough Kollmann's formula is easy to use and enables wood properties to be calculated when the grain angle is known, it does not take shear into account and is not directly applicable to cross-laminated composite woods such as plywood [110]. For this reason, some authors use different fracture criteria or formulas to account for this phenomenon. One example is Tsai-Hill's criterion: \n\nAs previously mentioned, the mechanical properties of wood are clearly correlated with its density. Density is highly variable, whether at the level of a given species, a given tree, or even a growth ring. Thus, it is important to optimize accurate measurement of this property with a view to sorting wood material. Two major families of methods can be distinguished for measuring this property: \"physical/mechanical\" methods and \"spectroscopic\" methods. \n\nAmong the methods in the first category, the most classical is simply to measure the mass of the sample under study and divide it by the volume. There are also hardness probes such as the Pylodyn [91], the Resistograph [92] or ultrasonics [93], which can be used, for instance, on standing trees [94]. These methods are all destructive or at least require contact with the element to be measured, which is not the case for spectroscopic methods. For the latter, the interaction existing between the material and radiation possessing a certain frequency is used. \n\nAmong the different wavelengths, only a few are suitable for measuring the density of wood. Ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation cannot be used because wood is opaque to these wavelengths. X-rays, with \n\nSeveral methods have been developed to measure cracks in veneers, including acoustic measurements [105]. Denaud et al. [106] employed this approach by recording sound and cutting forces during the peeling \n\nAnother way of measuring the grain angle slope is a scattering method based on the \"tracheid effect\". When condensed light, such as a laser beam, is shone onto the surface of wood, the beam is diffracted by the wood's fibres and tracheids. The result is an elliptical spot oriented in the same direction as the slope of the grain. The latter is then calculated from the ellipse formed by the observed light (Fig. 35). Based on conduction at the wood surface, researchers have used a similar set-up, but instead of measuring the reflected laser beam, they now measure the ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0263822323011364-main.md"}

These measurement methods can then be automated to map the grain slope on a veneer (Fig. 36). \n\nThe use of image analysis also makes it possible to identify the woody rays and thus the deviation of the wood grain, with the aim of mapping these deviations in 2D (Fig. 37). This method, which is relatively simple to implement, also fails to provide information on the out-of-plane component of grain deviation [113,114]. Out-of-plane deflection can be measured using methods such as wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) characterization. By adjusting the positioning of the veneer under study, both in-plane and out-of-plane deflection can be measured [62,63]. Other methods are based on measurements using radio waves of various frequencies [115]. The major disadvantage of these characterization methods remains the measurement time, which is much longer than for the methods discussed above. \n\nIn the literature, Okuma [117] proposes a laminate model considering the effect of the glue. To do this, he considers the part of the veneer penetrated by the glue as a ply with different mechanical properties. Wei et al. [86,117] propose an improvement to this model by considering the intake of glue to the wood composite. This model also considers the densification of the plies linked to the design of the LVL by press-fitting. \n\nThe global Young's modulus of the laminate in a given direction can therefore be predicted using Equation (5). \n\nB. Castanie et al.\n\nWei et al. [118] also show, via their model and a test campaign, that the influence of glue becomes negligible if the LVL is manufactured with thicker veneers, since its relative quantity in the composite material will be less for the same geometry. The authors have shown that this theory appears to give good results for 1, 2 and 3 plies ( Fig. 39 ) but further, more systematic investigations are in progress. To the best of our knowledge, only one publication has proposed the complete consideration of real veneer geometry without resorting to homogenization. Pot et al. [18] model a beech LVL beam made up of plies with different peeling crack frequencies and depths. In addition, the model considers whether or not the crack is closed by the glue joint. This model enables us to take a quantitative look at the influence of peeling cracks and their interaction with glue on flexural and shear modulus ( Figs. 39 and 40 ).\n\nIn view of the above, the behaviour of wood is complex, not only because of its orthotropy, but also because of the many factors that influence its behaviour, such as temperature, moisture content, type of load, defects and, when considering LVL, the manufacturing method. In the case of static or quasi-static loading, it is considered linear and brittle in tension in the fibre direction, and ductile in compression in the fibre direction (see Fig. 8 , [120] ). As the loading rate increases, the cell walls begin to deform locally, and the wood's behaviour becomes non-linear.\n\nFor all these reasons, the development of numerical models for wood is\n\nOther materials present in LS-DYNA can be used to model wood: \nMAT_143, MAT_126 and MAT_026. It should be noted that the last two models are based on honeycomb materials whose macroscopic architecture can be compared to that of wood. A comparison of these different models was carried out by Maillot et al. [124]. Using unit test simulations, these authors conclude that the current state of wood models \n(MAT_143) does not seem capable of representing balsa wood in confined compression and shear. They also conclude that MAT_MODIFIED_HONEYCOMB gives more appropriate results for the loads studied. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0263822323011364-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 283, "text": "Baumann et al. [125,126] also compare material models under LS_DYNA, including MAT_143 and MAT_126. Although these models may be representative of tests on solid wood, the authors conclude that additions are necessary, such as the inclusion of strain rate or damage modelling. In addition, the orthotropic nature of wood requires a large number of characterization tests. A few authors have adapted and implemented non-linear behaviour laws from the mechanics of continuums and other materials. For example, Oudjene and Khelifa [127] have implemented an orthotropic elastoplastic constitutive law which makes it possible to consider, for solid wood: (1) ductile compressive behaviour with densification perpendicular to the grain; (2) brittle tensile failure parallel and perpendicular to the grain; (3) compressive failure with softening parallel to the grain. They identified the parameters of the law using simple compression and bending tests on spruce wood. \n\nVarious numerical approaches to modelling LVL are presented in the literature. A first approach is linear modelling using Finite Element Methods (FEM), considering the veneer as a layer of the laminate (plate or volume) to simulate the linear part of tension, compression or bending tests [128,129]. The addition of failure criteria such as the maximum stress, Tsai-hill, Hashin or Puck, criteria makes it possible to set up simple LVL models for tension, compression or bending tests [130,131,132]. In addition to these linear models, inhomogeneities in wood and in veneers can also be considered. Zerbst et al. [133] add wood mapping to their model, playing on the type of wood (winter wood or spring wood) to account for veneer inhomogeneity (note that they model sliced veneer, not peeled). The grain angle [134] or defects such as knots can also be considered by modifying the local stiffness of the model [135]. In addition, scaling factors can be considered to account for different geometries between simulations and material property identification tests [136]. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the weakness of some modelling strategies may stem from the lack of input data, and also from the variability of mechanical properties for a particular tree species. To account for the variability of mechanical material properties, some authors propose 3D stochastic finite element models and Monte Carlo simulations to analyse stress states in bending, tension and compression tests [137]. However, these linear models, even when coupled with failure criteria for LVL, fail to account for experimentally observed failure modes as, by using failure criteria, we obtain the force at failure in the weakest element during the applied stress, whereas the initial fracture of the specimen does not necessarily correspond to its final failure. In such cases, a non-linear or more complex model is required to dissociate initial damage and specimen failure (Fig. 41) [130,131]. \n\nFor example, Susainathan et al. [122] used a LS-DYNA MAT_143 model to model low-velocity, low-energy impact on a sandwich with a plywood core. Due to the large number of materials contained in the plywood and skins, only a rough estimate of material properties was made to implement this model. Despite this, the model correctly predicted sandwich behaviours, particularly for 5 Joule and 10 Joule impacts, where damage was limited. Most of the discrepancies observed between experimental and numerical results, notably in terms of initial slopes, maximum loads and maximum deflections, were less than 20 %. However, significant discrepancies were observed for permanent indentation, energy absorbed by the sandwich and 15 Joules impacts. \n\nThe explanation put forward is that the material damage model in LSDYNA does not sufficiently incorporate the effects of softening in the damage process. \n\nModels including the interfaces are also proposed in the literature. \n\nBy adding cohesive elements between plies, delamination between LVL \nplies or cracking within plies can be considered [138,139,140]. However, although some authors use cohesive elements to model the bonded interface between LVL plies, others note that it may have its limitations on bonding with solid wood. Muller et al. [141] carried out a shear simulation of the glue joint and found that, in certain study areas, the shear strains obtained by simulation and those measured experimentally differed (Fig. 42). The authors conclude that a more complex approach is needed to model glue joints due to the structural complexity of bond lines and the uncertain mechanical properties of adhesives. One difficulty in modelling glue joints resides in the description of the mechanical behaviour of adherent wood and the wood-glue interface line [142]. \n\nAs the glue penetrates the wood, it modifies these mechanical properties locally. However, the model developed by Müller et al. [141] is, on average, comparable with experimental measurements. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0263822323011364-main.md"}

A \n´\n\nHowever, in this model, the LVL is modelled only as a solid element and bonded interfaces and various veneers are not considered. \n\nSaavedra Flores et al. [143] proposed an interesting model, but for cross laminated timber (CLT), and investigated the rolling shear failure in CLT structures by homogenization and cohesive zone models. Despite its high numerical complexity this model is relevant and captures the failure mode quite well as shown in Fig. 45. There are few dynamic models of wood. Sebek et al. [144] modelled European birch tested with Hopkinson bars. The model considers anisotropy, elasticity, plasticity, and failure. Moreover, the asymmetry for failure in tension and compression was also addressed. The continuum damage mechanics approach was adopted through a simple material weakening but the model does not consider the strain rate dependency. \n\nOn balance, this selection of articles shows that significant modelling work remains to be done and that the intrinsic complexity of the material and its natural dispersion are difficult to model. However, there is abundant literature on composite fracture models, like the Discrete Ply Models [145,146,147], which could be adapted to model wood imperfections [148,149]. \n\nFor its use in means of transport, wood will certainly be used in conjunction with other materials, in particular with long-fibre composites, as has already been done in aviation (see Fig. 70). The aim of this section is to provide a non-exhaustive overview of some of the studies carried out on this subject. \n\nSusainathan et al. studied sandwich structures with a wood core and skins made of aluminium, carbon, glass, and flax [44]. The manufacturing issues and static bending response of these structures were studied. The quality of the bonding between skins and plywood core can vary with the manufacturing method (vacuum moulding or thermo-compression). Susainathan et al. used epoxy resin from aeronautical applications with a high curing temperature, which could degrade the wood properties during the manufacturing process. The bending tests performed showed the interest of the mechanical characteristics in comparison with those of an aeronautic carbon, Nomex, used for flooring of aircraft which was used as a reference for this study. The sandwich with plywood core and carbon skins provided the best bending stiffness, while the sandwich with plywood core and glass skins provided the best resistance. On the other hand, these solutions were too heavy, with a ratio of 3 with respect to the reference used in the study. \n\nNevertheless, many optimizations exist to improve the specific resistance of such structures and are worth investigating, considering that their cost is one twentieth of that of the solution currently used for \n\nThere have been numerous studies of sandwiches with Balsa cores, because of their widespread use in naval applications [156], but wood sandwich cores with very different geometries have also been used \n[157]: honeycomb core, I-shaped core, interlocking lattice core, corrugated core, moulded core, pyramid lattice core, single-layer fibre core, single-layer strand core, and multi-layer fibre core. Some authors have merged the wood with foams to make cores [158]. Wood has also been identified as a component of eco-based sandwich structures [159]. \n\nHybrid sandwiches with a foam core, rubber-cork and E-glass intermediate composite layers, and wood skins have been tested by Demircioglu ˘\net al. [160]. \n\nAs far as laminates are concerned, the mixing of veneer with other materials was studied as early as the 1960 s [161,162] with the fibres available at the time, namely glass fibres. It has also been possible to use carbon plies for this purpose [163,164,165] and, more recently, basalt fibres [165,166]. More specifically, Zhou et al. [167] performed an experimental study on the effect of elevated temperature on the bond integrity of aramid, basalt and carbon fibre reinforced polymer bonded to wood systems. This study, among others, shows the good capacity of wood to be bonded efficiently to a wide variety of materials. \n\nThere has also been a recent development in studies on the hybridization of wood with natural fibres. Pereira Acosta et al. studied wood/ \njute laminates manufactured by infusion [168]. These hybrid laminates were shown to have better mechanical performance than wood-only \n\nThis limited number of examples shows that solid wood or plywood is perfectly compatible with composite materials, metals or natural fibres, opening up very broad prospects for structural design by incorporating it as a core material in sandwich structures or directly as a laminated element [173]. \n\nMany authors have shown that wood behaviour is not always the ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0263822323011364-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 285, "text": "The level of stress in compression between elastic deformation and densification is also higher when the strain rate is high. To reveal this relation clearly, the range of strain rate tested must be large enough, from quasi-static to highly dynamic loading. For instance, Targarielli et al. [178] compared experiments with a range of strain rates, running from 0.0001 to 4000 s\n− 1 (Fig. 46). Vural and Ravichandran have also shown that the densification phase occurs at a lower strain if the strain rate is high [179]. \n\nIn the previous paragraph, the good post-impact compressive strength of some sandwich specimens was highlighted [151,155]. The positive effect of wood on shock absorption has been known empirically for some time. For example, the hull of the USS Constitution (early 19th century) was able to withstand cannonballs fired at 15m. The ship was composed of three layers, with white oak for the two outer layers and Virginia oak for the core. It was successfully used during the Tripoli War of 1812. To the authors' knowledge, no scientific studies have been carried out on this subject to find explanations. More recently, wood has been used as a shock absorber in the transportation of nuclear waste [180,181,182] or as a crash barrier for motorways [183,184]. Generally speaking, the dynamic behaviour of wood has been studied for many practical applications according to [185]: atomic blast [186], 19th century warship [187] or wooden buildings [188]. Recently, Ding and Binienda [189] studied the dynamic behaviour of birch trees to analyse the crashworthiness of an aircraft in a birch forest. Many authors have also analysed the dynamic properties of wood, for example with the Hopkinson bar [190,191,192], but the aim was not to highlight the interesting natural absorption properties of the wood. \n\nNaturally, coconuts have developed an energy absorbing capacity, which has been the reason for the analyses of coconut wood crashworthiness carried out by several authors [193,194,195]. Nguyen et al. \n\nFig. 48 shows that the SEA of tubes made of wood or with wood as the core have very interesting SEA values, and that these materials are perfectly suited to energy absorption, at low economic cost and with a low carbon footprint. They are also perfectly renewable. The fact that plywood has good energy-absorbing capacity was also corroborated by Naghizadeh et al. [203] in a comparative study of solid wood and OSB \n(Oriented Strand Board) under high velocity impact. In [204] Heyner et al. studied the crash behaviour of mixed wood/steel beam structures that could be used as automotive door impact beams. According to the authors, the result of hybridization was interesting, even though the weight of the prototype beams was comparable to that of the reference steel beam. On the whole, wood shows much better crash behaviour \n\nThese boats were used for a long time and models have been found over a long period; for example, the 22 canoes found on Lake Sanguinet (Landes, France) are dated from 1732 BCE, for the oldest, to 1621 CE \n[207]. They were mostly pine but some were oak. Later, structures were made in several caulked elements for sealing [205]. The most striking examples are the solar boats of Egypt. The solar ship of Khufu (2550 BCE) is one of the oldest and largest boats of ancient times. It is 43.6 m long and 5.9 m wide. It is a masterpiece of the ancient craft of shipbuilding and this boat is composed of more than 1600 different pieces, some of which are marked with mounting indications. It was discovered in a sealed pit carved out of the Giza bedrock [4]. In antiquity, these ships were perfected to allow navigation in the Mediterranean: Thalassa. \n\nTwo notable types developed, merchant ships and warships. Phoenician merchant ships are emblematic of the first category where the Gaulos appeared around 2000 BCE (Fig. 50). The Greek and Roman triremes with their sails, their rows of rowers and their spur are a perfect example of the second category (Fig. 51). However, no wreckage has been found with certainty and little information on their method of construction remains. All that has been established is that they were made of local wood, namely fir, pine, or cedar [208]. There are very few wrecks because, being made of wood, the ships hardly ever sank and, when they did, the wood was quickly eaten away in the sea and disappeared in a few decades.

{"doc_id": 286, "text": "In the Middle Ages, construction techniques evolved and envelopes were mounted on structures like Viking ships (4th to 13th century). They had a T-shaped keel in one piece (or possibly two) with articulated couples on the keel to keep a certain flexibility and elasticity. The drakkars or snekkars were real sea serpents which slid and deformed along the waves following the swell. Their sides were made of planks assembled with clapboard (with an overlap). Hulls, mostly oak or pine, were caulked with tar-coated hemp. They did not have a bridge but beams went from one side to the other and served as a thwart [209]. \n\nThe Vasa, launched and sunk in 1628, is an emblematic wreck \n\nFrame-first construction involves laying down the framework of the vessel before attaching the planks to the boat. This is done by erecting a master frame in the centre of the keel, then the ribs, and afterwards deriving the shapes of the other frames using a curved piece of wood stretched between the frame and the end posts, or through a geometric curve. This type of assembly appeared during the 5th century CE. \n\nThe Endeavour is an emblematic 18th century ship, aboard which explorer James Cook set out in 1768 to explore and map New Zealand and part of Australia. A replica of the Endeavour was built in 1988 using plans kept at the Greenwich Maritime Museum [211]. The 19th century saw maritime exchanges intensify across the Atlantic as ships capable of traveling the oceans and defending fleets were built. Precise plans exist from this period and the manufacturing techniques are well known, which facilitates the production of replicas. One of the most famous is certainly the Hermione (3 masts, 65 m long), the frigate that took Lafayette to America to support the American Independence Army in 1870. It accidentally sank off Brittany in 1793. The replica, whose construction began in 1997, was launched in 2014. The construction techniques used were identical to the original, as were the materials, in particular the use of 2000 oaks for the construction of the hull [212,213]. \n\nDuring the end of the 19th century and until the end of the first half of the 20th century, many leisure or racing boats were built in wood, including many in mahogany. Sailing boats gradually gave way to motor boats. The Chris Craft factory is a perfect example of boatyards of the time [214]. It began in 1861 by building small mahogany boats for family trips on lakes, then equipped its boats with increasingly powerful motors at the beginning of the 20th century (Fig. 52 (a)) and became one of the largest manufacturers of day boats and runabouts. During World War II, it built more than 12,000 patrol boats, utility launches, and rescue vessels for the United States Navy and Army (Fig. 52 (b)). During the 50th they manufactured their first fibreglass boat in 1971, and also their last mahogany boat. The maintenance of wooden boats was becoming too expensive compared to that of composite ones. \n\nMany wooden boats were built during World War II. The \"splinter fleet\" was a nickname given to the United States' wooden boats used in the war, where they fulfilled many different roles (Fig. 53). They were built in small boatyards everywhere on the American coast and could be built quickly, in just 60 to 120 days. Most of the boats were built by boatyards that already had the tools and knowledge from building yachts, sailing boats and motor boats. Many were built by craftsmen in family-owned small businesses. These wooden boats were lighter and easier to repair than steel hull boats, particularly as there was a shortage of steel and steel shipyards. Many of these boats used plywood for their manufacture, especially for the hull [215]. \n\nNevertheless, from the beginning of the 20th century, steel had started to replace part of the wooden structures in sailing boats. During the 1960 s, fibreglass gradually replaced wood for the hulls of pleasure boats. Maintenance was greatly simplified but the charm of the wood was lost, or remained in the form of veneer. Nowadays, only the fittings, in plywood or solid wood, and the covering of the decks, in teak, are still made of wood. There are very few wooden boat manufacturers left and they are mainly sailing boat builders.

The plywood structure is then mounted around the metal structure which takes up the main forces of the keel and the shrouds, the whole contributing to the rigidity of the hull (Fig. 55). The glass/epoxyinfused, plywood-clad deck is then assembled with the hull (Fig. 11b). \n\nThe junctions are reinforced with GFRP epoxy. The assembly is then covered with an epoxy paint to protect the wood from the marine environment (Fig. 11a). Units are up to 14 m long [10,11]. The advantage of these boats is mainly the lightness of the structure, its structural rigidity and their silence during navigation.Fig. 56. \n\nIn 1769, military engineer Nicolas Cugnot built the first vehicle \n\nFor this reason, Cugnot obtained the support of the Duc de Choiseul, Louis XV's Minister of War, for the development of the project. A steam boiler alternately powered two cylinders, installed on either side of a single driving wheel. Designed to reach 15 km per hour, the fardier, \n\nIt also had a reverse gear. Measuring 7.30 m, weighing 3.5 tons, with wheels and structure made of wood, it did not have a long career, as the prototype, which had no braking system, hit a wall. Joseph Cugnot's research came to an immediate halt. Fig. 57 shows a recreation of Cugnot's fardier. \n\nMany of the very first automobiles, in use before 1914, had wooden chassis or body components. In a 1920 article, Ermendorf [218] explains the use of plywood in automobile construction. Firstly, thanks to their use in aeronautics, glues had really improved compared with the \n\nIn this review article, we have chosen to focus on some of the lesserknown examples of industrial adventures involving automobiles with working wooden structures. First and foremost, come the achievements of English engineer Frank Costin [223,224,225]. This former De Havilland engineer was responsible for several plywood aircraft, including the famous DH 98 \"Mosquito\", which reached speeds of 612 km/h and was one of the best planes of the Second World War [154]. With the experience he had acquired in aeronautics, Frank Costin was responsible for numerous prototypes of racing vehicles, most of them with plywood chassis. He was behind the Marcos brand, which he co-founded with Jem Marsh (MARsh and COStin), producing several hundred cars between 1959 and 1972. The GT (Fig. 59 (a)), which existed with a wide range of engines, had an all-plywood chassis. It was made up of 386 separate plywood pieces that had to be cut out and glued together in a time-consuming process. This is probably why, despite its lower weight, the original plywood chassis was later replaced by a steel chassis. One model produced in only 12 examples was the Costin Nathan GT (Fig. 59 \n(b)), which was very light (around 400 kg) and had a central plywood shell. On both ends, a tubular subframe was mounted to support the suspension and mid-mounted engine. One of the main reasons for the extensive use of wood was that it offered a strong, lightweight construction at a fraction of the cost of a similar aluminium chassis [224]. It made Le Mans 24-hour race in 1967, but its small capacity engine (1100 cm3) was a handicap on the Hunaudi`eres long straight line, and it soon retired. However, the models produced went on to win various races in England over the years. Finally, a single example of the Mantis (Fig. 59 (c)) was produced with a resolutely modern look, illustrating the adaptability of plywood design. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0263822323011364-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 288, "text": "The Africar was imagined, designed, tested and produced by a visionary Englishman, Tony Howarth, in the 1980 s [226]. It was inspired by the Citro¨en Mehari, but with a chassis and bodywork made of marine-grade epoxy resin-impregnated plywood. The aim was to create an all-terrain vehicle that would be easy to repair and have a minimum lifespan of 30 years (see Fig. 60). An expedition from the Arctic Circle in Norway to the Equator in Uganda was organized with the support of a TV channel. The films [227] and the book [228] show the performance of the three vehicles involved (a sedan, a pickup and a 6wheel station wagon) over difficult terrain, crossing the Sahara, the Sahel and difficult tracks in Central Africa and Zaire. The plywood chassis remained pristine while some metal parts, like the gearbox, cracked due to fatigue. Despite the quality of the prototypes and the chassis, the Africar company was poorly managed and soon disappeared. \n\nThe English Morgan brand is an icon of car manufacturing \n[229,232]. Since 1936, Morgan cars have been built with an aluminium or steel \"ladder\" chassis, consisting of two longitudinal beams and several crossmembers. The aluminium body is attached to an ash superstructure, which in turn is attached to the chassis. An excellent description of this structure is given by a restorer in [231], and is partially reproduced in Fig. 61. These are the last cars still built according to this scheme. Despite this old-fashioned method, the Morgans meet automobile safety standards. The latest evolution of this model \n(Plus 6, see Fig. 61) uses more wood than previous versions [230]. Production, which has remained deliberately small-scale, stands at around 300 cars a year. \n\nFor the moment, major automakers have shown little interest in wood, but Toyota presented a highly original concept car at Milan Design Week in 2016, designed by chief development engineer Kenji Tsuji [233]. The Setsuna, which means \"moment\" in Japanese (Fig. 62), \nis made entirely of wood, using the traditional Japanese carpentry technique of \"okuriari\" (no nails or screws). According to [233]: \"As a functioning vehicle, it was important that different types of wood were selected for specific applications. For the exterior panels, Japanese cedar \n(*Cryptomeria japonica*) was chosen for its combination of vivid colour, refined wood grain, and overall flexibility. For the frame, Japanese white birch (*Betula platyphylla*) was selected for its strength and rigidity, while the floor uses Japanese zelkova for its strength and durability. Finally, the seats are constructed in smooth-textured castor aralia (*Fatsia* japonica)\". The concept car is 3.03 m long and 1.48 m wide, with a height of 0.98 m. The bodywork comprises 86 interchangeable elements, as shown in Fig. 62. Its colour changes over time according to weather conditions (humidity, temperature). It is electrically propelled. \n\nRenewed interest in wood is reflected in a number of recent research programmes. The most noteworthy is the Austrian WoodC.A.R. project. \n\nAccording to [235], \"The vision of the K-Project WoodC.A.R. (Wood - \nComputer Aided Research) is to introduce Engineered Wood Products \n(EWP), Engineered Wood Components (EWC), and wood-based materials to the mobility sector, which follows the demand for improvement of environmental and economic sustainable materials in this branch. Key for the application of EWPs and EWCs in the engineering and the development process are reliable Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) \nmodels of wooden materials exposed to dynamic and static loads.

{"doc_id": 289, "text": "Additionally, new production technologies for shaping, joining and bonding are required. Simulation tools, as well as new technologies, will open new markets within and beyond the mobility sector\". Dynamic simulations were carried out on automotive structural components (subfloor, rear panels and front instrument carrier) based on a previous research programme called CULT (Car Ultralight Technologies), see Fig. 63. An exhaustive species characterization programme was carried out, involving over 5,000 tests to obtain the material maps required for crash simulation. Some of these tests were even robotized [236]. A \nsnowmobile structure was also designed and crash-tested. All in all, the programme has shown that it is possible to simulate wood components for the transport sector [237,238]. Moreover, an economic comparison shows a clear advantage for wood solutions in terms of mass savings, unit part costs, and tooling investment. For example, the cost of tooling to produce the aluminium floor is 1,400 k€, whereas it is only 100 k€ for the wood solution. \n\nFig. 59. Some of the production wooden cars designed by Frank Costin. \n\nAlthough the transition to aluminium-alloy metal structures had begun in the 1920 s [242], many aircraft continued to be built in wood until the Second World War. At the time, aluminium was a strategic, expensive metal, that was less readily available than today. Structures were classically made of plywood, solid wood or sandwich with light wood as the core. This last point was addressed in a previous review \n[154] and will not be repeated in detail here. A few significant examples are given below. Fig. 65 illustrates the typical design principles of a wooden wing on the A.N.E.C. (Aeroplane Air Navigation and Engineering Company) aircraft of 1923. According to [243] \"The spar is of triangular section, and is built up of three corner strips of spruce, joined under each rib by an internal triangle formed of thin spruce strips. The whole is covered with plywood. The entire leading edge is covered with plywood\". In the inter-war period, new resins and glues were developed, enabling the development of more efficient assemblies [244]. As an application, the Hughes H-4 Hercules remained, until recently, the world's largest aircraft, with a wingspan of 97.54 m, and it is made \n\nA record-breaking aircraft is presented in [246,247]: the Lockheed Vega (Fig. 66). It was a four-passenger (plus pilot) aircraft that was one of the fastest of its era. Using a wooden monocoque fuselage, plywoodcovered cantilever wings and the best engine available, the Vega delivered on the promise of speed. The fuselage was built from sheets of plywood, skinned over wooden ribs. Using a large concrete mould, a single half of the fuselage shell was laminated in sections with glue between all layers and then a rubber bladder was lowered into the mould and inflated with air to compress the lamination into shape against the inside of the mould. The two fuselage halves were then nailed and glued over a separately constructed rib framework. This solution, with two half-fuselages bonded and nailed, was also adopted by some of the best aircraft of the Second World War (see Fig. 67), such as the De Havilland Mosquito DH-98 [154], nicknamed \"the wooden wonder\". The following figure shows a view of the construction. The Mosquito is a good example of the possibilities offered by wooden structures (here a sandwich structure with birch or Douglas-fir skins and a balsa core), since it reached a speed of 618 km/h and was produced in 7,781 units. Like the Lockheed Vega, this is a \"one-shot\" composite solution. It is interesting to note that composite methods were already in use in the 1940 s, with the use of autoclaves (see Fig. 68) for the production of plywood parts [248]. \n\nDuring the Second World War, the US Forest Product Laboratory gave considerable impetus to the design of timber structures [249]. Among other things, this led to the drafting of design manuals [250,251]. Some very common test methods for aeronautical structures, such as the deformable square [252], originated from work carried out by the US Forest Product Laboratory on aeronautical plywood.

{"doc_id": 290, "text": "However, after the Second World War, the golden age of wood use clearly came to an end, with the spread of aluminium construction and the arrival of the first composite materials [154,242]. Nevertheless, a few specific applications remained, such as fuselage skins, ailerons and flooring. Today, only a limited number of wooden aircraft are produced. Most are simple, inexpensive aircraft that can be built by amateur builders for education or recreation and not for large production. Two good examples among dozens are the Varieze and Vari-Viggen planes made by Burt Rutan in the 1970 s [256], and inspired by the Saab Vigen Fighter, shown in Fig. 70. The main structure was made of plywood and was easy to build using normal techniques. Spruce was used for spars and longerons, and aircraft plywood for the formers, ribs, and skin. The plywood skin was covered with lightweight Ceconite and finished with dope followed by polyurethane. In France, a tradition of wood construction has endured to the present day. The Mudry CAP 10 is an acrobatic aircraft made entirely of plywood and weighing approximately 530 kg. Around 300 have been built since 1968 (Fig. 70). An improved and certified version, the CAP10 BK, incorporates carbon spar beams (Fig. 70) for enhanced performance. The aircraft is now manufactured by Robin Aircraft. This company is well known in the aviation world for its DR 400, now the DR 401, made entirely of plywood, 2,700 of which have been produced since 1972 [257,258]. In [257], the company demonstrates that, when properly designed, bonded and protected, the structure's service life is very long. \n\nTwo new French companies are also involved in the design and production of lightweight aircraft incorporating wood structures. Aura A´ero is in the process of certifying a wood-carbon aerobatic aircraft (the Integral R, see Fig. 71 and ref. [259]). Avions Mauboussin is also developing an all-wood light aircraft with electric or hydrogen propulsion, based on the DH-98 \"Mosquito\" with a sandwich under the trade name Y. The wood species used in the manufacturing process of \n\nIt may seem surprising to find wood in this field too, yet its use in specific applications has existed since the beginning of the space adventure. Wood's ability to absorb dynamic loads is well known, and balsa impact attenuators have been studied for various applications. They were used for the Ranger missions to the moon in the early sixties \n(see Fig. 72). According to [261] \"The sphere was 65 cm in diameter, and it surrounded a transmitter and a seismometer instrument that was designed by the Caltech Seismological Laboratory. The sphere would separate from the spacecraft shortly before impact and survive the rough landing on the moon. The capsule was also vacuum-filled with a protective fluid to reduce movement during impact. After landing, the instrument was to float to an upright position, then the fluid would be drained out so it could settle and switch on.\" Unfortunately, the three Ranger spacecraft that carried the sphere either crashed without returning data or missed the moon. Nevertheless, it was later used to measure the hardness of the lunar soil, which was unknown at the time. \n\nIn 1965, a space probe project for a Mars landing was studied with an impact attenuator consisting of a spherical payload contained within a thick spherical shell of balsa wood. The design specified that \"The spherical balsa shell will be constructed of segments of balsa in sufficient number so that the approximate grain direction throughout the balsa sphere is radial\" [262]. In 1966, NASA published a specific study [263] \nof environmental effects on the crushing response of balsa, where the effect of vacuum, moisture content in the wood (between 0 and 20 %), \ndensity (80 kg/m3 to 240 kg/m3), and temperature (-87 ◦C to + 150 ◦C) \non mean crushing stress were studied. [263]. \n\nCork, mixed with phenolic resin, is the material most widely used to protect spacecraft, and has been since the 1960 s [264]. It bonds perfectly with today's composite structures and is used on the fairings of civil and military launchers as a thermal protection system [281]. It is also used for thermal protection during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere or when entering that of Mars. During these phases, friction of the upper level of the atmosphere causes the cork to burn and char, leaving behind a layer of charcoal. Both the cork and the charcoal are very good insulators. Then the burnt layer is blown away during the descent and the cycle repeats. Finally, very little heat is transmitted to the spacecraft. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S0263822323011364-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 291, "text": "According to [282], some Chinese satellites have probably used solid oak wood as thermal protection during these re-entry phases. Among all the published applications, a recent study for a European Mars lander \n(Schiapparelli Module) caught our attention (Fig. 73). The Descent Module is shown entirely covered in cork [265], and a posteriori heat flow calculation has been carried out [266,267], showing good prediction and indicating the effectiveness of the NORCOAT LIEGE® coating. \n\nIt is truly surprising to see that cork has been transported to Mars, proving its intrinsic effectiveness in this field. A recent study details the physical mechanisms involved [268]. Many of the above points are presented in an interesting popularization video [269]. \n\nTo conclude this quick tour of tree products in space, it is interesting to note that two studies are currently underway, in Japan and Europe \n(Finland), to use wood as a structural material for small satellites. The Japanese LignoSat Space Wood study [270] proposes to launch a satellite made of magnolia wood to low Earth orbit. In addition to being environmentally friendly to manufacture and burning completely in the Earth's atmosphere when deorbited, a wooden satellite would be largely transparent to radio waves. Communications and research antennas \n\nThe European satellite (Fig. 74 (c)) is made of Finnish birch plywood \n[272], but with some additional elements to help it to withstand space conditions. A camera is deployed on a boom for the main objective of this mission, which is to film the behaviour of the wooden structure. \n\nAs described in [273], the standard birch plywood used for WISA \nWoodsat is dried in a thermal vacuum chamber before being coated with a thin layer of aluminium oxide by atomic layer deposition, to minimize outgassing from the wood while also protecting against the erosive effects of atomic oxygen. It is also planned to test other varnishes and lacquers on some sections of the wood. \n\nWood has accompanied the mobility needs of human beings for 6,000 years. Although its use in this field has greatly decreased during the last century, the examples chosen in the naval, automotive and aeronautical fields clearly show the potential of wooden structures in the field of mobility. The carbon footprint of these structures is only a fraction of that of metal structures. Contrary to popular belief, their crash behaviour can be excellent and the problem is all the less severe as the crashed structures can be lightened with wood. Another important advantage of wood is the ease with which it can be mixed with other materials, which puts \"the right material in the right place\". The question of resource management is delicate because the sensitivity of forests to global warming is great. For the Northern Hemisphere, the resource exists and is available. For the Southern hemisphere, deforestation is massive. However, a use with high added value, such as in the transport industry, could lead to more reasoned management or even to replanting for this purpose for local use. \n\nFrom a structural calculation point of view, wood and plywood are very complex, even when compared to composites. The literature concerning plywood is sparse and there is a marked need for models that are both exhaustive and predictive. Many points demand the attention of researchers for practical purposes and, in particular, applications to the automotive and aeronautical industries: the development of damage models adapted from those of composites so as to carry out static calculations, in damage or crash tolerances for sizing common areas or junctions. The methods of identification of the parameters of these models will also have to be adapted to the materials. Finally, the significant variability of the veneers should be integrated in one way or another. A possibility studied in the French research programme initiated in 2021, ANR BOOST [274,275], is in-process measurement, during and/or instantly after peeling, of the local characteristics (surface scanning) of the veneers to introduce them into a dedicated veneer and plywood model. Generally speaking, interest in research on wood or plywood for transportation has flagged and there is a wide area of research to be developed in terms of characterization and modelling, environmental effects, and many others, from the scale of coupons to real structures. In general, as during the Second World War, wood is a resource that can be strategic and contribute to the resilience of a society. Studies such as the preservation and sustainability of the resource must be given increased attention. \n\nB.

China high speed railway experiences several developing stages from absence to appearance, from exploration to innovation and from studying to leading [1]. The development advantage is remarkable. The total distance of the high speed railway in China is more than 40,000 km. The four vertical and four horizontal networks of the high speed railway have been built. It is widely welcome for the general public in China. The positive attitude for the high speed railway is growing in the world.\n\nAt present, new sciences and technologies are developing rapidly. \n\nNew generation technologies such as the information technology, intelligent manufacturing, new material and processing, innovating design philosophy have revolutionary influence on the high speed train. It promotes the high speed train performance such as intelligence, reliable operation and environment-friendly [2]. Based on many years investigation of the trend of the technology development and requirement of general public, the trend of technology development in five aspects are presented in this paper. The five aspects include economic applicability, high speed and efficiency, green and low carbon, intelligent safety, comfortable and high quality.\n\nEconomic applicability promotion of the high speed EMUs includes cost-performance promotion, requirements satisfaction, and new energy and hybrid power EMUs.\n\nCost performance promotion of the high speed EMUs is achieved with the methods such as increasing capacity, decreasing manufacture cost, and reducing operation and maintenance cost. For instance, nearly 20% of the passenger capacity is increased by the layout optimization of the interior space of the carbody for the new generation high speed EMUs in France. China is seeing to develop the new generation high speed EMUs. The passenger capacity of this kind of EMUs is up to 578 persons. The development of double-layer EMUs is set out to increase the passenger capacity [3]. The factory cost is reduced with the methods such as optimization design, manufacturing process level promotion and recycling parts utilization. Compared with the manufacturing cost of China Railway High Speed EMUs (CRH EMUs), 15 million RMB per configured train is reduced for the manufacturing cost \n⁎ Corresponding author.\n\nE-mail addresses: zsren@bjtu.edu.cn (Z.S Ren).\n\nWith the development of integrated transportation system, high speed EMUs would satisfy all kinds of requirements for the high speed railway, low speed railway, interurban transportation, city and urban transportation. For each kind of EMUs, two requirements would be provided to ease interconnection and interworking, promote transportation efficiency, push forward the trade exchange and wealth creation, and excite the tourism. Railway transportation is highly needed to participate in the development of the domains mentioned above [4].\n\nIt is highly necessary to develop the high speed cargo EMUs. The speed of these kinds of EMUs is 250/350 km/h. It satisfies the rapid transportation and multimodal transit requirement. High speed transportation is not only for the passengers delivery, but also for the small items express [5]. Therefore, the high speed train for cargo transportation must be developed.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2949867822000022-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 294, "text": "For the intercontinental transportation, the technologies including operation reliability, ride comfort, widely-environmental adaptability, and interconnection and interworking for the long routing condition will be developed. Meeting the culture, travel and standard demands of different countries and areas, high speed EMUs for the intercontinental passenger and cargo transportation would be developed. Moreover, high speed train for variable gauge transportation must be build to adapt the standard gauge and broad gauge delivery. High speed EMUs for the interconnection and inter-transit have been manufactured by China Railway Changchun Company and Tangshan Company. The top operation speed of this kind of EMUs is 400 km/h. However, the application effect and adaptability of this kind of EMUs need to be examined. Technologies such as the automatic gauge change, noise reduction, cold resistance, energy saving and operation safety must be promoted [6].\n\nNew energy and hybrid power EMUs must be developed to meet the demands of low carbon emission and electric power supply shortage in some countries and areas. Currently, 10 countries arrange or plan to arrange the hydrogen cell trains. For instance, FV-E991 is developed in Japan and its top speed is 100 km/h. The operation distance of this kind of train is 140 km for each charge. Regio VT642 is developed in German and it is reconstructed from diesel coach to hybrid power EMUs. In 2014, Alstom exhibits the design scheme of an accumulator tank-diesel mixed power locomotive in InnoTrans. China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC) developed an intercity EMUs with accumulator tank and it is tested in a non-electrified railway located at Inner Mongolia. The operation speed of this kind of EMUs with accumulator tank power could reach 160 km/h [7]. The first delivery of the new energy and hybrid power EMUs will achieve in 2025.\n\nThree strategies could be taken into account for high speed and efficiency of the EMUs. They are presented in the following.\n\nBased on the technologies of 300 km/h high speed EMUs, the top operation speed of the current EMUs could rise to 400 km/h. In order to achieve the operation speed 400 km/h, it is highly important to reduce the aerodynamic resistance and noise based on the currently high speed railway technologies [8]. Some technologies such as the low resistance of the streamline front, optimized structure of the roof equipment and all covered outside wind block can be introduced to smooth the carbody surface. It is highly useful to decrease the operation resistance and energy consumption. Compared with the total resistance and energy consumption of CRH EMUs, 12.3% and 17% aerodynamic resistance and energy consumption of the CR EMUs are reduced as shown in Fig. 1, respectively. Furthermore, compromise among the power, energy consumption and lightweight of the train would be solved. Based on the field test data, 34% power increases as the operation speed rises from 350 km/h to 400 km/h for a same kind of high speed train, and 31% brake energy recycle is increased simultaneously. Operation cost of the high speed train must be decreased.\n\nLow vacuum piping is useful to avoid the aerodynamic resistance and noise. It breaks through the friendly environmental constraint under the high speed condition. Moreover, it is highly effective to optimize the resource distribution of the super-city groups, to reduce the public and production transportation constraints because of the timedistance separation, and to form an hour living circle within 600 km and 1,000 km interval. At present, lots of practical works have been implemented by some companies such as ET3, SWISSMETRO and Hyperloop one as shown in Fig. 2 [11]. Some technologies have been innovated. Super-Maglev test rig has been established in China as shown in Fig. 3. It is a platform to test the traction, communication and vacuum reduction of the low vacuum piping maglev train. With the platform, vehicle dynamics and aerodynamics investigation have been implemented.\n\nBased on the overall architecture design of the heat balance and vacuum hold of the piping system, some technologies need to be further developed. These technologies are related to operation, maintenance and security guarantee, in which it includes infrastructure and tunnel \n\nThree methods can be generally introduced to improve the operation efficiency. The first one is to promote the technologies and utilize intelligent maintenance to reduce the failure rate and improve the reliability. Another is to integrate the door opening and train starting/ \nstopping to cut down the train stop interval. The last one is to decrease the braking distance to increase the operation density of the train.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2949867822000022-main.md"}

Further study would be carried out to find the new material that has large friction brake capacity and high heat dissipation [14]. Aluminum alloy and carbon fiber composite can be used to manufacture the brake units. Moreover, new technologies and manufacturing process must be taken into account to improve the high temperature stability of the brake units.\n\nEmergence brake optimization and control is another effective method to shorten the brake distance [15]. Based on the wheel/rail adhesion limitation, new mechanical-control unit can be applied to increase the brake velocity of the train. For instance, more multilevel emergence brake control is introduced in CR EMUs to shorten the emergence brake distance, and on the other hand, high wheel/rail adhesion margin remains. The brake distance is 6,367 m as two levels of emergence brake control are used and 5% wheel/rail adhesion remains. The brake distance is shortened to 5,529 m as four levels of emergence brake control are used and 5% wheel/rail adhesion remains.\n\nAccording to the double carbon targets, not only the energy consumption must be cut down, but also the noise and carbon emission must be decreased. Three strategies can be employed to achieve the targets.\n\nLightweight of the train is one of the effective strategies to achieve the green and low carbon target. N700S high speed EMUs is manufactured by central Japan Railway Company and it operated since 2021 as the Tokyo Olympic Game was hold. Lightweight and energy conservation are its highlight. Compared with N700A, the axle load and energy conservation of N700S are 11 t and 7% energy reduction, respectively. The total weight of the N700S train for 16 vehicles configuration is less than 700 t. Compared with Velaro, 15% axle load of Velaro Novo is reduced. The axle load of CR EMUs is 17 t, and the axle load of new type of EMUs is no more than 14.5 t. The strategies to reduce the axle load include lightening the carbody and cab structure, lightening the weight of the traction and brake system, decreasing the weight of the bogie and miniaturizing electric device. The weight lightening can be fulfilled with the application such as new structures, new materials, new manufacturing processes and new devices. For example, with the application of sandwich board for the luggage rack and side-wall board, 30%− 40% local weight of the carbody is decreased\n[16]. With the introduction of the metal framework and lightly composite sandwich structure, 28% carbody weight is reduced [17]. After lightening the vehicle weight, the operation resistance, energy consumption and noise can be decreased. The carbon emission of the high speed transportation is consequently cut down.\n\nThe optimization of the streamline design and manufacturing process of the train is another strategy to reduce the operation resistance and noise. The streamline of the first vehicle must highly satisfy the aerodynamics requirement [18]. After optimization of the streamline of the first vehicle of the CR EMUs, 12.3% aerodynamic resistance is reduced, 11% riding index is decreased and 3 dB noise is cut down of the train [9]. Compared with CR EMUs, 1.5% aerodynamic resistance will be reduced for the new generation high speed EMUs. Furthermore, the envelopment technology application for the windshield, air conditioner, high voltage equipment, equipment cabin, bogie and convex part of pantograph will decrease the turbulence loss, pressure difference and friction resistance of the train [19]. According to the investigation of CRRC, 5.7% aerodynamic resistance can be cut down with whole envelopment technology application for the windshield of the vehicle joints. 4% aerodynamic resistance and 1 dB noise can be reduced with the sinking platform of the pantograph system, respectively. 6.1% \naerodynamic resistance and 1.6 dB noise can be decreased with the envelopment technology and spoiler application for the bogies, respectively.\n\nDeveloping highly efficient and light traction equipment is helpful to promote the power density and efficiency. The devices and technologies such as high power ( more than 1 Megavolt Ampere) and lightweight wide bandgap Sic device (>300 ℃), high frequency auxiliary variable techniques and permanent magnet synchronous motor technology will be developed for the new traction equipment [20].", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2949867822000022-main.md"}

At the stages such as product research and development, manufacture, operation and maintenance, the efficiency and quality must be improved to promote the ability of the service life guarantee of the train. Focused on the application requirements of the consumers, drivers, passengers and maintenance personnel, the intelligent transportation ecosystem including data uni-communication and information collaborative interaction will be established to provide the safety prediction, operation administration, intelligent maintenance and smart travel service for the consumers and passengers.\n\nIntelligence is highly important to guarantee the operation safety of the EMUs. On the other hand, some special safety technologies are absolutely necessary. The special safety technologies include the prediction, early warning and prevention technologies for the natural calamities and external environment influence such as earthquake early warning, close early warning and wind-rain-snow early warning to improve the ability of disasters prevent and natural disaster reduction [22]. Train-train interconnection and instant communication is useful to improve the operation safety and intelligence. Emergency autorunning and spare power system are important for the emergency support and failure rescue of the high speed EMUs.\n\nOnline monitoring and early warning technologies for the detection of the key equipment and structure service status of the train would be developed. It includes the service status online monitoring system for the key structure and early warning projects for the structure safety assessment. For instance, establishing vehicle-mounted safety monitoring system and integrating the information such as temperature, vibration and fire warning of the Train Control and Ministration System (TCMS) to monitor the safety status of the train can be employed. Adding several oscillation sensors to monitor the stability of the bogie and ride comfort of the carbody can be applied. The data of the oscillation sensors would be further investigated to find the rules of the fatigue damage accumulation. It is helpful to achieve the fatigue reliability analysis and fatigue early prediction of the key structures [23]. \n\nMonitoring the equipments, circuits and functions tightly related to the operation safety of the train is beneficial to improve the multi-system, train and train-train monitoring levels. The equipments, circuits and functions include the major circuits, braking units, auxiliary control, electrical insulation, bogie condition, fire and emergence warning.\n\nPassive safety technologies would be further developed. It includes the dynamic characteristics study of the materials to establish the data base. Power distribution, stiffness matching of the main part and energy absorption zone, material selection of energy absorption device, design of energy absorption device and lightweight optimization are all taken into account for the passive safety technologies under the fully covered condition of the train [24]. Developing lightweight, high-performance and impact resistance energy absorption structures is another target for the passive safety technologies. Train-train impact experiment is necessary to obtain the core data and to support the structure design.\n\nRide comfort of the EMUs is reflected in the sensibility and experience of the passengers. The sensibilities include vision, hearing, smell and psychological ease. High quality indicates the service level requirement of the passengers. As shown in Fig. 4, ride comfort includes many factors such as in-car temperature and humidity range, oscillation \n\nEach index has detailed values. For example, the noise indexes for the middle and end part of the in-carbody are no more than 68 dB and 70 dB, \nrespectively. The ride comfort index and acceleration of the carbody are no more than 2.5 and 1 m/s2, respectively. All of the indexes are presented after several years with the test and theoretical study results. It indicates that the EMUs in China has excellent stability and ride comfort [25]. The ride comfort must be the same as the operation speed of the new type of EMUs increases. Therefore, the dynamic performance accommodation and matching between the train and track system must be investigated to ensure the high ride comfort [26].\n\nInside air tightness of the carbody must be improved. The outside air pressure fluctuation gets large as the train passes through tunnels and train-train cross. High outside air pressure transmits to the inside of the carbody as the air tightness is not so good, in which it leads to ear buzzing and earache of the passengers. It effects the ride comfort of the train [27]. Simultaneously, improving air tightness is helpful for the transient pressure solving.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2949867822000022-main.md"}

Semi-active control and active control of the lateral and vertical dampers of the bogies would be employed to make the high speed EMUs have excellent ride comfort [28].\n\nElectromagnetic compatibility effects the health of the drivers and passengers. It can be improved with mechanical and electrical equipment protection and reasonable interval distance control. Monitoring would be introduced to limit the electromagnetic environment index no more than the permission of the related standard [29]. Optimizing the parameters of the buffer unit and formulating the reasonable traction curve help to control the acceleration change rate, and to achieve the longitudinal impact indexes.\n\nFor the good service of the train, extended connection service would be offered to satisfy the requirements of the passengers. It includes Wifi covering during the whole trip, information system offering the comprehensive real-time trip messages for the passengers, barrier free passing and recreational facilities providing, in which they are useful to reduce the loneliness and irritability of the passengers during the trip\n[30]. Starting with good service effect, management modes and efficiency, good job training and new service modes are all helpful to improve the service quality.

Their impact transcends conventional mobility, permeating industries like healthcare and shipping services. AVs operate autonomously, devoid of direct human intervention, and mark a pivotal juncture in transportation evolution. Our comprehensive meta-analysis employed the PSS (Product Related, Social Related, and Security Related) framework to discern the converging and diverging factors influencing individuals' proclivity towards adopting AV technology. Scrutinizing 72 studies from 54 articles, with a cumulative sample size of 32,540, our research identified critical determinants of AV adoption: perceived usefulness, attitude, trust, safety, hedonic motivation, and social influence. Noteworthy, our study unveiled that these relationships were subject to modulation by factors like automation levels, vehicle ownership, and cultural nuances. Significantly, our findings shed light on a relative scarcity of incentives for widespread public acceptance of AVs. Our study provides empirical insights and theoretical contributions that offer valuable guidance for practitioners and policymakers navigating this transformative technological landscape. These recommendations are poised to steer the evolution of AV technology towards a more widely accepted and integrated future. In healthcare, integrating autonomous vehicles is a groundbreaking opportunity to elevate patient care and medical services. AVs can facilitate swift, precise transportation of critical medical supplies, enabling timely responses to emergencies and ensuring the availability of vital resources in remote or underserved areas. This advancement holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, ultimately saving lives and enhancing the overall wellbeing of communities. \n\nAutonomous Vehicles (AVs) present an opportunity to revolutionize transportation networks and, consequently, impact public health positively (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2015). However, alongside the projected benefits of AVs, there are concerns regarding potential adverse outcomes, including increased travel demand and a shift away from public transit and active transportation towards AVs (Pakusch et al., \n2018). Formulating effective policies is crucial to address these challenges and maximize the benefits of AVs. This begins with identifying and prioritizing issues that require attention (Howlett et al., 2009). Despite efforts to understand the implications of AV implementation on public health, there remains a dearth of research in this area (Milakis et al., 2017). Recognizing the importance of comprehending the health The field of transportation plays a pivotal role in shaping public health in urban areas, with its systems, technologies, activities, land use, and infrastructure significantly influencing health outcomes (Iamtrakul et al., 2023). Unfortunately, transportation-related factors contribute significantly to avoidable fatalities and a substantial burden of disease. \n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1.4 million deaths globally due to motor vehicle crashes. In comparison, 4.2 million deaths were attributed to ambient air pollution, with traffic-related pollution accounting for one-fifth of these fatalities in countries like the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany (Lelieveld et al., 2015; WHO, 2018). Moreover, transportation noise poses a significant health risk in urban environments, contributing to premature death and illness (Mueller et al., 2017; Sohrabi et al., 2021). These negative impacts stem from various sources, such as harmful emissions, traffic-induced stress, E-mail address: nadia.adnan233@gmail.com. 1 Assistant Professor Management and Marketing. \n\nARTICLE INFO \neffects of AVs, researchers have emphasized the need for public awareness of potential health benefits to encourage acceptance and use of AVs (Li et al., 2018; Pettigrew et al., 2018). However, studies indicate a limited understanding among respondents regarding the health advantages of AVs, underscoring the need for further education and awareness efforts (Pettigrew et al., 2018).

{"doc_id": 299, "text": "In healthcare, adopting AV technology introduces specific security challenges, particularly regarding data privacy and confidentiality \n(Adnan et al., 2022; Hilgarter and Granig, 2020). Ensuring patient data remains secure and maintaining trust in AV healthcare systems are paramount, especially in regions like Saudi Arabia, where cultural sensitivities around data privacy are high (Adnan et al., 2022). As the volume of data processed by AV machines and software in healthcare grows, so does the risk of security breaches, necessitating stringent security standards and policies (Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia). Additionally, physical and virtual attacks on healthcare facilities' systems pose significant threats, highlighting the importance of robust security measures (Hilgarter and Granig, 2020). Despite the potential of AV \ntechnology to revolutionize healthcare, there remains a gap in understanding the factors influencing user acceptance and adoption of this technology. Behavioural theories such as the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) offer frameworks for comprehending user behaviour. To address the unique challenges of AV adoption in healthcare (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2015). To address this gap, researchers should focus on tailoring existing theories to the healthcare context and conducting empirical studies to identify drivers and barriers to AV adoption. \n\nAdditionally, meta-analysis offers a valuable approach to synthesizing findings from multiple studies, providing a comprehensive understanding of AV adoption factors and informing policy and practice \n(Knoll and Matthes, 2016). AV technology holds immense promise for improving healthcare delivery, addressing security concerns, and understanding user acceptance, essential to realizing their full potential. By leveraging behavioural theories and research methods like metaanalysis, we can advance our understanding of AV adoption in healthcare and develop effective strategies for its implementation. \n\nThe systematic review conducted by Milakis et al. (2017) revealed that despite multiple efforts to comprehend the effects of autonomous vehicle (AV) implementation, the conversation around the public health implications of AVs is still in its nascent phase. Li et al. (2018) stressed the significance of comprehending the effects of AVs on public health to develop policies and govern effectively. Additionally, Pettigrew et al. (2018) examined the importance of public knowledge regarding the possible health advantages of autonomous vehicles (AVs), as it can help in the acceptance of AV rules and encourage the use of these vehicles. Yet, a study conducted by Pettigrew et al. (2018) found that respondents showed limited knowledge about the possible health advantages of AVs. This indicates that respondents were neither strongly responsive nor considered the importance of AV health advantages significant. However, the unique healthcare environment poses specific security challenges and concerns for adopting AV technology. Anonymity and data ownership, confidentiality, privacy, and access controls are critical measures to prevent unauthorized access to patient data. Maintaining privacy and ensuring that patient data and health statuses remain confidential are paramount. Trust emerges as a fundamental concern, given that the AV healthcare industry involves machines processing data for various users. Saudi Arabia faces a particular challenge regarding the underutilization of expensive medical equipment in hospitals, mainly due to a shortage of highly trained medical professionals to operate such machinery. Additionally, patient data, especially in light of the COVID19 pandemic, has become even more sensitive. This heightened sensitivity towards sharing patient data is influenced by cultural awareness of potential data breaches or improper use (Adnan et al., 2022; Hilgarter and Granig, 2020). \n\nAs the adoption of AV technology in healthcare expands, along with the increasing volume of data uploaded to AV machines and software, 2 the risk of security threats also rises. This necessitates the government and healthcare institutions' development of stringent security standards and privacy policies. These policies are influenced by limited computing power, many networked devices, data, and scalability issues, as outlined in the ISO/IEC 27002 standard (Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia). Another crucial security consideration concerns the potential risks of physical and virtual attacks on healthcare facilities' machines and data processing systems. An example in Saudi hospitals is the challenge posed by interns, residents, and other part-time employees who may access the hospital system without an established off-boarding process to deactivate their access once their contract has concluded (Hilgarter and Granig, 2020). Hence, securing network servers and user authorization for these networks is paramount to preventing cybersecurity attacks. Despite the promising potential of AV technology in healthcare, a notable gap exists in understanding the factors influencing user acceptance and adoption of this technology. Established behavioural theories such as the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology \n(UTAUT) provide a valuable framework for comprehending user behaviour towards technological adoption. However, they require further application and customization to suit the distinct context of autonomous vehicles in healthcare. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2590198224000964-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 300, "text": "To bridge this gap, researchers should focus on tailoring these theories to the specific challenges and intricacies of AV technology adoption in the healthcare sector. This involves exploring how cultural, social, and contextual factors influence individuals' perceptions and intentions towards using AVs for healthcare services. Additionally, conducting empirical studies that apply these adapted theories can yield valuable insights into AV adoption drivers and barriers, ultimately informing the development of effective strategies and interventions. The adoption of AV technology in healthcare holds immense potential for enhancing patient care and operational efficiency. However, it also introduces unique security challenges that necessitate robust measures to safeguard patient data and ensure stakeholder trust. These considerations are pivotal in realizing the full benefits of AV technology in revolutionizing healthcare delivery. Bridging the gap in understanding user acceptance through the application of established behavioural theories is essential for optimizing the integration of AVs into the healthcare landscape. \n\nMeta-analysis, as defined by Glass (1976), involves statistically synthesizing an extensive collection of independent research results to integrate findings. In recent years, Information Systems (IS) research has shown a growing interest in this method (Jeyaraj, 2022b). This approach has proven valuable in understanding the complexities of disruptive information technology within the IS discipline. In the context of autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption, meta-analysis proves to be a powerful research tool. It consolidates critical relationships and a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing AV adoption by synthesizing findings from multiple studies (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2015). This method enhances the generalizability of relationships, allowing for more robust conclusions about AV adoption (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2015). \n\nAdditionally, it facilitates testing the applicability and utility of theories in comprehending specific phenomena, providing a comprehensive overview of existing evidence (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2015). \n\nOne pertinent study in the context of AV adoption is conducted by Fagnant and Kockelman (2015). Their research focuses on preparing a nation for autonomous vehicles, providing insights into opportunities, barriers, and policy recommendations for AV adoption. Incorporating this study into a meta-analysis enables researchers to consolidate findings and recommendations with other relevant studies, offering a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing AV adoption. \n\nAnother significant study by Hao et al. (2023) examines the acceptance of autonomous vehicle services among older people in Beijing, China. This study provides insights into the factors influencing the willingness of older people to use AV services. Including this study in a meta-\n\nThis study has three main goals: (1) Create a thorough conceptual model for the AV adoption framework that considers variables linked to products, society, and security; (3) Examine the potential moderation effects of automated degree, car ownership, and culture.

The following sections are set up: A summary of the literature study, conceptual model, and hypothesis development is provided in Segment 2; Sections 3 and 4 describe the meta-analysis results. Section 5 examines the critical findings, the sixth segment outlines the theoretical and practical contributions of the research, the seventh section explains its limitations, and the eighth section makes suggestions. \n\nAutonomous Vehicles (AVs) in the healthcare sector have emerged as a focal point for both the industry and academia, primarily due to their advanced features and capabilities worldwide (Sohrabi et al., 2021). The integration of AV technology in healthcare caters to human curiosity and the pursuit of innovation and facilitates a network connecting machines globally, thereby minimizing human intervention in data processing (Tam et al., 2021). Generally, AV systems in healthcare comprise four layers: sensors for data collection, a network for data communication control, a processing layer, and an application and service layer \n(Surendran et al., 2021). \n\nSignificant investments in artificial intelligence and connectivity devices are being made in the Saudi healthcare sector to promote AV \ntechnology. The Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority \n(SDAIA) has partnered with Royal Philips to drive digital transformation in healthcare, which aligns with the Kingdom's Vision 2030. However, security and privacy concerns persist as manufacturers often overlook these aspects during AV device and software development (Adnan et al., \n2022). This negligence exposes consumers' data to potential cybersecurity threats. \n\nTo address privacy concerns, the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Saudi Arabia has issued guidelines for informed consent, emphasizing the protection of patients' privacy and establishing trust (Choi and Ji, 2015). Despite recent strides in data protection legislation by SDAIA, \nchallenges remain in safeguarding electronic health records (EHRs) (Hilgarter and Granig, 2020).

{"doc_id": 301, "text": "Trust plays a pivotal role in consumer acceptance and usage of AV \nhealthcare technology. Trust and security are intertwined, with system reliability being a cornerstone for building consumer trust (Dirsehan and Can, 2020). Users are more likely to engage with AV devices or software when trust is established, even in the face of potential risks (Adnan et al., 2018). However, existing trust models do not fully encapsulate the behavioural aspects influencing trust and technology adoption, particularly in the Saudi healthcare industry (Almazroi et al., 2022). \n\nWhile trust models like the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) \nhave shed light on the importance of trust in technology acceptance, they overlook critical behavioural traits that influence trust and adoption decisions. Consequently, there is a gap in understanding consumer trust judgments and their impact on AV adoption in the Saudi healthcare industry. To address this gap, this study aims to identify variables influencing consumer trust judgments and their subsequent adoption of AVs in the Saudi healthcare sector, thereby bridging the research deficit and providing valuable insights for industry stakeholders. \n\nThe AV technology trust model in the healthcare sector, outlining its structure and scope. Adopting automated vehicles (AVs) in healthcare settings is influenced by established behavioural theories and contextual factors. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology \n(UTAUT) have been extensively applied to understand technology adoption and acceptance, including AVs (Zhang et al., 2021; Golbabaei et al., 2020; Huang and Qian, 2021; Sarwar et al., 2020.). \n\nThe TPB posits that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control affect behavioural intentions. Positive perceptions of AVs, including performance, reliability, security, and privacy, influence adoption decisions (Zhang et al., 2021). Similarly, the TAM emphasizes perceived usefulness and ease of use in shaping behavioural intentions, with trust being a critical dimension impacting AV adoption \n(Zhang et al., 2020). The UTAUT integrates various acceptance models and considers performance expectations, effort expectations, societal impact, and enabling variables (Golbabaei et al., 2020). In addition to behavioural theories, contextual factors are vital in AV adoption within healthcare settings, encompassing organizational, environmental, and individual factors (Tomoaia-Cotisel et al., 2013). Table 1 provides a summary of the literature review. \n\nOrganizational factors, such as the availability of resources and support, can influence the implementation and adoption of AVs in healthcare centres. Environmental factors, such as the infrastructure and regulatory framework, can also impact the feasibility and acceptance of AVs in healthcare settings (Dean et al., 2019). Individual factors, including demographic characteristics, personality traits, and previous experience with technology, can shape individuals' attitudes and intentions towards AV adoption (Golbabaei et al., 2020; Huang and Qian, 2021). For example, individual differences, such as conscientiousness and neuroticism, have been found to influence individuals' expectations and perceptions of AVs, including factors like data security and adoption barriers (Zhang et al., 2021; Huang and Qian, 2021). Personality traits, such as high sensation-seeking, have been identified as predictors of the intention to adopt AVs (Huang and Qian, 2021). \n\nMoreover, contextual factors related to healthcare, such as the complexity of the healthcare system and the availability of support from caregivers, can also influence individuals' adoption decisions (Clark et al., 2009). It is important to note that behavioural theories and contextual factors do not solely determine the adoption of AVs in healthcare centres. Other factors, such as the potential health benefits of AVs, including reductions in road fatalities and injuries, also shape individuals' attitudes and intentions towards AV adoption (Dean et al., \n2019). Additionally, AVs' adoption rate, technological capabilities, and ownership models can introduce uncertainty and influence individuals' adoption decisions (Dean et al., 2019). In conclusion, the adoption of AVs in healthcare centres is influenced by a combination of prominent behavioural theories, including the TPB, TAM, and UTAUT, as well as contextual factors. These theories provide insights into individuals' attitudes, intentions, and perceptions towards AV adoption, while contextual factors shape the specific circumstances and conditions in which AV adoption takes place. Understanding the cumulative influence of these theories and factors is crucial for promoting the successful adoption of AVs in healthcare settings.

{"doc_id": 302, "text": "In this model, several factors related to consumers' intention to trust have been discussed. A detailed description of each aspect of the model follows this and an analysis of the research hypotheses. The trust model in the AV technology in the healthcare sector was classified into three categories, according to Lee and Turban (2019) - Personality theory, \n\nExamples of these external factors include the Ministry of Health, as they directly affect the operations and workforce of public hospitals since the funding and management of these hospitals come directly from the MOH. \n\nAdditionally, the most significant TAM variables—perceived usability and ease of use—were used to collect additional factors influencing adoption positivity. Further components gathered from the scientific literature were combined to form a framework based on a social psychology perspective. The point mentioned above helps to comprehend how a person's behaviour in a social situation could be influenced by the behaviours that others exhibit and social conditions. \n\nThe theoretical framework that underpins this investigation is shown in Fig. 1—the theoretical foundations of technological adoption. According to the report Role of First-Line Managers in Healthcare Change Management, first-line managers need to be empowered to drive change in the hospital and define their roles and responsibilities to lead change in the hospital and engage the staff. \n\nTrust-related factors and research hypotheses Various elements related to products impact trust in healthcare services or products provided by autonomous vehicles (AVs). The functionality and reliability of AV technology have been identified as significant contributors to trust (Jayaraman et al., 2019). Functionality denotes the technology's capacity to perform specific tasks and provide necessary features, while reliability pertains to its consistent and adequate performance (Bart et al., 2005). Studies have demonstrated that reliability positively influences trust in adopting AV technology in healthcare (Jayaraman et al., 2019). In addition to functionality and reliability, safety-related factors are pivotal in shaping trust in AV technology. Perceived risks linked with AVs are crucial when assessing trust (Ayoub et al., 2021). Safety concerns stemming from system failures pose significant apprehensions for users, and mitigating these risks is essential for fostering trust in AVs (Ayoub et al., 2021). Trust in the technical capabilities of AVs is also paramount, particularly concerning potential risks like fatalities in the event of malfunctions (Hurst and Sintov, 2022). \n\nMoreover, the perceived usefulness and dependability of Fig. 1. Conceptual research model. \n\nUTAUT underscores the significance of social influence and facilitating conditions in technology acceptance, suggesting that endorsements from healthcare professionals and adequate support mechanisms are crucial (McKnight et al., 2011). \n\nFurthermore, trust in the healthcare system and providers significantly influences trust in AV technology. Establishing trust in the healthcare system signifies quality care and profoundly impacts the decision to trust healthcare products or services (Lai et al., 2011). AV \ntechnology is shaped by various factors, including functionality, reliability, safety concerns, social influence, and trust in the healthcare system and providers. Building trust in AV technology necessitates addressing these factors while ensuring functional, reliable, and safe technology and establishing trust in healthcare systems and providers. Therefore, end-users will not accept failures of AV; the first hypothesis is: \nH1a: Reliability and functionality of technology positively affect user trust in adopting AV technology. \n\nThe ability of an AV (Autonomous Vehicle) to provide practical, appropriate, and responsive advice can be described as helpful and necessary to complete a task. The device should also include guidelines and instruction pages (Choi and Ji, 2015). One of the main reasons people do not use technology is the fear of not having a response or appropriate support when things go wrong. This point was further discussed in the \"AI in Healthcare Improving Human Interface for Patient Safety\" report. The researcher notes that cognitive ergonomics in AI \nmachines in healthcare, which relates to human cognition, memory, and mental processes, is neglected when hospital leaders choose an AI system for their operations. All these challenges hinder the benefits of AV \ntechnology and negatively affect the adoption process (Adnan et al., 2022), causing a waste of hospital budget and resources. \n\nBased on the theory and the references provided, it can be concluded that several factors contribute to users' trust in AV technology. Firstly, knowledge about AVs is crucial in shaping users' trust. Lack of knowledge can lead to mistrust or over-trust in the capabilities of AVs (Ayoub et al., 2021). Therefore, providing users with accurate and comprehensive information about the technology can enhance their trust. \n\nSecondly, the level of security of AV technology influences users' trust.

This can be achieved through robust safety measures, effective communication of security features, and a track record of successful and safe operations (Reig et al., 2018). \n\nAdditionally, personalized features in AVs can increase users' trust. \n\nPersonalization allows the system to adapt to individual drivers' behaviours and preferences, making the system more reliable and familiar to users (Sun et al., 2020). This familiarity and customization can enhance users' trust in the technology. Perceived trustworthiness is another critical factor that positively impacts users' trust in AV technology. Trust in AVs can be influenced by factors such as explainability, predictability, and perceived integrity of the technology (Ayoub et al., 2021; Hurst and Sintov, 2022). Users who perceive AVs as trustworthy and morally responsible are likelier to trust and adopt the technology (Hurst and Sintov, 2022). \n\nOverall, AV technology's helpfulness, including knowledge, security, personalization, and perceived trustworthiness, positively impacts users' trust in adopting AV technology. By addressing these factors and ensuring that AVs are reliable, secure, and trustworthy, the adoption and acceptance of AV technology can be promoted. Moreover, if users receive adequate support, they might believe they can successfully handle the new system, leading them to adopt it (Luttrell et al., 2015). In summary, a good investment in end-user support will lead to greater confidence, translating into adopting AV in healthcare. Therefore, we hypothesize that: \nH1b: Helpfulness of technology positively impacts users' trust in adopting AV technology. \n\nIn this section, usefulness refers to how users believe using a particular technology involves minimal effort and no complications. \n\nKeng et al. (2021) stated that technology is essential in increasing users' trust in the technology. Usefulness is also usually related to how accessible and user-friendly the system is. For example, the likelihood of the end-user making mistakes when using AV should be minimal, associated with trust in the AV healthcare machine or software (Keng et al., 2021). Studies have shown that increasing end-user satisfaction is positively related to the high usability of AV in healthcare, which affects adoption intent (Koul and Eydgahi, 2018). For example, Adnan et al. (2022) found that the adoption of AV in healthcare is positively affected when users believe that a particular technology is easy to use. Abu et al. reported similar results to Khalid et al. (2021) and found that ease of use is one of the most important factors for adoption. Consumers tend to be influenced by external social factors and use the commonly used AV in healthcare products and services (Choi and Ji, 2015). Therefore, perceived ease of use and trust are expected to influence each other, leading to the acceptance of AV in healthcare. An example is the health monitoring applications released and supported by the Ministry of Health, which were heavily used in the COVID-19 era. Therefore, we hypothesize that: \nH1c: Perceived ease of use significantly impacts user trust in adopting AV technology. \n\nH1d: Perceived usefulness significantly impacts user trust in adopting AV technology. \n\nUsers may associate the degree of usefulness of an AV machine or software with how it would enrich their performance and lifestyle \n(Adnan and Shahrina, 2021). Examples of new technologies introduced in Saudi Arabia include the brilliant state-of-the-art nursing room at King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center in Riyadh and the Epic system at Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare Center in Dhahran City. The satisfaction level of consumers affects their confidence and vice versa, which eventually leads them to adopt the AV technologies used in the healthcare sector. Different studies have found that perceived usefulness is among the most critical factors influencing users' intention to adopt AV in healthcare (Hilgarter and Granig, 2020). In addition, the TAM model states that usefulness is an essential factor influencing user behaviour when adopting new technology (Norden and Shah, 2022). It also contributes to the end users' feeling that the perceived usefulness of AV in healthcare enables users to improve their performance in everyday situations (Rojas-Rueda et al., 2020). Therefore, to ensure the success of the adoption of AV, perceived usefulness needs to be promoted. \n\nH2a: Social networks positively impact consumer trust in adopting AV technology.

{"doc_id": 304, "text": "Community interest in AV technology is essential because it increases trust and interaction (Luttrell et al., 2015). In addition, culture also has an impact on how people make decisions. Despite the increase in globalization, there are still cultural differences between nations and how they react to a particular technology. For example, a video camera 7 sensor may elicit a different reaction in a conservative Middle Eastern culture than in less conservative cultures. To manage that concern, a study of the local market and the national legislation must be conducted before applying any new technology. As medicine moves toward using technology in every aspect of treatment, some patients may have privacy concerns about virtual clinic visits due to the culture in Saudi Arabia and prefer to have direct contact with their doctor. This factor will negatively or positively affect the adoption of new technology (Prem Raja and Vasudevan, 2022). However, the lack of other solutions could influence user trust (Adnan et al., 2018). There are still no studies on the influence of culture on user trust (Hengstler et al., 2016). Consequently, local community and market interest must be considered to ensure the success of a new AV in the health sector, and local perception and other related barriers to the trust process must be studied. Thus, it is assumed that: \nH2b: Community interest positively impacts consumer trust in adopting AV technology. \n\nThe study delves into safety factors concerning the perception of risk associated with adopting new healthcare technology. Safety is a primary concern among users contemplating new technology adoption, influencing the process significantly (Adnan and Shahrina, 2021). The lack of security in autonomous vehicles (AVs) within healthcare settings poses a notable barrier to consumer adoption (Adnan et al., 2018). Additionally, integrating technology into patient care presents challenges for medical students, who may lack prior exposure to such tools during their university studies. Consequently, medical institutions are urged to leverage technology to prepare future physicians better. \n\nTrust establishment through safety-related factors is pivotal, categorising factors into product safety (trustee) and perceived risks. This encompasses AVs' capacity to address security concerns like availability and confidentiality, influenced by factors such as the trustee's reputation, past behaviour, and performance (Adnan et al., 2018). Security stands out as a critical concern in new technology introductions (Adnan et al., 2022), with AVs in healthcare emphasising security and privacy, which are vital for enhancing consumer confidence. Key security objectives must be met, including ensuring data confidentiality, availability despite attacks, data integrity, and device authenticity. Users tend to trust AV software and devices that offer robust user access control and demonstrate readiness and capability (Sohrabi et al., 2021). \n\nEnhanced security correlates positively with trust in AV healthcare products or services. Hospitals are advised to provide staff training preand post-implementation of new technologies to foster trust. \n\nConsumer confidence in healthcare AV technology is influenced by perceived risks associated with the technology, impacting perceived value and trust (Man et al., 2020). Trust, a multifaceted concept, is shaped by various factors, such as user perceptions of enjoyment, utility, and attitude (Huang, 2023). Communication strategies addressing perceived risks effectively enhance trust in AVs (Omeiza et al., 2021). \n\nAdditionally, consumers' trust mechanisms significantly influence their behavioural adoption intention (Wei et al., 2020). Several studies across contexts, including IoT-based healthcare and personalized autonomous vehicles, highlight the relationship between security and trust. While further research may be necessary to comprehensively explore the specific link between security and trust in healthcare AV technology, existing literature suggests that heightened security levels positively impact user trust in AV technology. Therefore, we hypothesize that: \nH3a: Product or service security positively impacts user trust in adopting AV technology. \n\nH3b: Perceived risk positively impacts user trust in adopting AV \ntechnology. \n\nH4: Perceived trust positively impacts the adoption of AV \ntechnology. \n\nIntegrating Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) brings about heightened risk perception in the healthcare sector due to their unique attributes. These include limited computer resources and, at times, less robust encryption measures. Consequently, consumers face increased uncertainty, posing significant challenges to their decision-making processes. While incorporating AV technology into healthcare promises benefits like enhanced patient care and more efficient medical logistics, concerns arise from the inherent vulnerabilities of these systems, such as computational limitations and potential security risks. This complexity necessitates a delicate balance between embracing innovation and addressing consumer apprehensions. Therefore, AV healthcare stakeholders must devise robust strategies that not only leverage the potential of these technologies but also alleviate consumer concerns.

{"doc_id": 305, "text": "We employed four distinct search strategies to identify empirical studies suitable for our analysis. Firstly, we conducted an extensive literature search across various databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. This comprehensive approach allowed us to gather a wide range of relevant studies, as Talebpour et al. (2017) recommended. We utilized specific keywords related to autonomous vehicle technology, such as \"autonomous,\" \"automated,\" \"self-driving,\" \"driverless,\" \"vehicle,\" \"transport,\" \n\"driving,\" \"acceptance,\" and \"adoption,\" combining them logically and applying them across multiple databases, following Talebpour et al.'s methodology (2017). \n\nSecondly, we manually searched prominent journals in the field, including Accident Analysis and Prevention, Transportation Research Part A, Transportation Research Part C, Transportation Research Part D, \nTransportation Research Part F, and Safety Science. This manual search aimed to identify additional studies not captured in the initial database search, which aligns with Talebpour et al.'s recommendations (2017). \n\nAfter systematically searching leading journals in the domain, we identified additional studies that may have been missed initially. Additionally, we consulted previous systematic reviews conducted by Adnan et al., (2022) to extract any relevant articles. These reviews served as valuable sources of information in identifying relevant articles for our analysis. \n\nFurthermore, we adopted a backward approach by revisiting the reference sections of selected articles to uncover any additional pertinent papers that may have been overlooked initially. This approach enabled us to include diverse studies, including published conference proceedings and journal articles, ensuring we captured the most up-todate research in the field. Our study retrieval and selection methodology involved a comprehensive literature search across multiple databases, a systematic search of leading journals, consultation with previous systematic reviews, and a backward approach. This rigorous approach allowed us to gather a comprehensive set of relevant studies \n\nS. No. \n\nKeywords combination for our analysis. Table 3 explains the keyword summary. \n\nFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, Fig. 2 visually outlines the study selection process. Initially, a comprehensive search across diverse databases yielded 2090 records, which were then screened for duplicates. \n\nThis step resulted in 1898 unique records. Subsequently, the titles and abstracts of these records were meticulously examined, with a primary focus on the empirical investigation of autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption. A thorough review of the full text was conducted for 540 publications, applying four inclusion criteria. Firstly, studies that empirically explored AV adoption were included. Secondly, only studies examining at least one bivariate relationship between antecedents and consequences of AV adoption were considered. Thirdly, articles written in English were incorporated into the analysis. Lastly, studies that provided quantitative information essential for effect size analysis (such as sample size, correlation, effect size, or regression coefficient) were included. This rigorous process ultimately led to the final selection of 72 articles. \n\nAdditionally, only bivariate correlations examined in at least five research were deemed appropriate for analysis. We excluded two significant studies that didn't examine the chosen bivariate associations. A \nminimum of three samples are required for meta-analysis, but it was found that samples under five may be more susceptible to sampling error. Consequently, connections that were looked at in at least five studies were included. Additionally, each study was analyzed separately when one article combined the findings of several independent investigations. As an illustration, findings on AV adoption from three distinct nations (Australia, France, and Sweden) were provided by Kaye et al. in 2020, each regarded as an independent study. It's important to note that the analysis also included data from Middle Eastern nations, particularly Saudi Arabia. Following the application of the defined criteria, a total of 85 studies originating from 72 distinct articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Within this selection, 50 studies were derived from journal articles, accounting for 58.82 % of the sample. The remaining 35 studies were sourced from conference proceedings or book chapters, making up 41.18 %.

The United States, particularly in Silicon Valley, is a hub for AV research and development, with companies like Tesla and Waymo leading the way. With its robust tech industry and supportive government policies, China is also a significant player in AV technology. Germany, known for its automotive engineering prowess, is making significant strides in AV innovation, while Japan is leveraging its technological expertise for safe and efficient AV \nsystems.

Companies like Waymo (a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.), Tesla, Uber, and General Motors' Cruise Automation are pioneers in this field. Traditional automotive giants like Ford, Toyota, and BMW are also heavily invested in AV research and development. Tech giants such as Apple, Nvidia, and Intel have made significant strides in AV technology, supplying crucial components and software. \n\nResearch institutions and startups worldwide contribute to this evolving landscape, collectively working towards safer and more efficient autonomous transportation solutions. \n\nResearch organization on autonomous vehicles \n\nProminent research organizations have been instrumental in propelling the advancement of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. \n\nAmong these, the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL) at Stanford University stands out as a trailblazer, making significant contributions to perception, control, and machine learning within the AV domain. Similarly, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) boasts extensive research efforts across various departments and labs, focusing on autonomous systems, including AVs. The University of California, Berkeley, has made notable strides through its Berkeley DeepDrive (BDD) initiative, particularly in computer vision and machine learning tailored for AV technologies. Additionally, Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute has played a pivotal role in shaping autonomous systems, making substantial contributions to AV development. Collectively, these organizations form a dynamic ecosystem of research excellence, driving innovation and reshaping the future of transportation through AVs. Their interdisciplinary approach and cuttingedge research continuously push the boundaries of what is achievable in this rapidly evolving field. Fig. 5 Index visually represents these key research organizations in autonomous vehicles. \n\nAutonomous vehicles hold the potential to revolutionize numerous sectors, including healthcare. Integrating autonomous vehicles into the healthcare sector can yield many benefits, such as enhancing patient care, boosting efficiency, and augmenting accessibility to healthcare services (Jerbi, 2023). These vehicles can serve various purposes within healthcare, ranging from transporting medical supplies to delivering medications and even operating mobile clinics for remote regions (Tanzil et al., 2014). A critical advantage of autonomous vehicles in healthcare lies in their capacity to elevate patient care standards by ensuring timely and efficient transportation of medical essentials. Conventional transportation methods often encounter delays and inefficiencies, adversely impacting patient outcomes. Autonomous vehicles mitigate these challenges by offering a reliable and swift mode of transportation, ensuring the prompt delivery of medical supplies and medications (Tanzil et al., 2014). \n\nMoreover, autonomous vehicles can enhance healthcare accessibility, particularly in remote and underserved areas lacking transportation infrastructure. These regions frequently struggle with inadequate access to healthcare facilities due to transportation limitations. Autonomous vehicles can bridge this gap by providing a mode of transportation independent of traditional infrastructure, significantly enhancing healthcare service accessibility for remote populations (Tanzil et al., 2014). \n\nAdditionally, autonomous vehicles contribute to overall healthcare sector efficiency. By automating transportation processes, healthcare organizations can streamline operations and reduce costs associated with manual transportation methods. Autonomous vehicles, operational round-the-clock, eliminate the need for human drivers and enable continuous, efficient transportation of medical essentials (Tanzil et al., 2014). Nevertheless, integrating autonomous vehicles into healthcare is not devoid of challenges. Ensuring the safety and reliability of these vehicles is paramount. Healthcare organizations must implement robust systems for safe and effective vehicle operation, incorporating advanced technologies for navigation, collision avoidance, and real-time vehicle performance monitoring (Lee et al., 2019).

{"doc_id": 307, "text": "Another hurdle is garnering acceptance and trust from healthcare professionals and patients alike. The successful adoption of any new technology hinges on building trust and confidence. Educating healthcare professionals and patients about autonomous vehicles' benefits and safety measures is crucial in allaying concerns and scepticism. Trustbuilding efforts can be facilitated through effective communication and showcasing the capabilities of autonomous vehicles (Lee et al., 2019). Integrating autonomous vehicles into the healthcare sector holds immense potential for enhancing patient care, accessibility, and efficiency. However, addressing safety, reliability, and acceptance challenges is imperative for successfully incorporating autonomous vehicles into healthcare operations. With careful planning, implementation, and education, autonomous vehicles can revolutionize healthcare service delivery, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare accessibility. \n\nFig. 5. Research organization on autonomous vehicles. \n\nCronbach's alpha and composite reliability are essential tools in coding techniques for evaluating the internal consistency reliability of scales or questionnaires. In contrast, Cronbach's alpha assesses the average correlation between items, and composite reliability accounts for item correlations and the variance of the latent construct (Reza, 2021; Khazaei et al., 2021). A Cronbach's alpha exceeding 0.70 is acceptable (Reza, 2021). Unlike Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability relies on structural equation modelling for computation, offering a more robust assessment of scale reliability (Khazaei et al., 2021). \n\nThese techniques furnish researchers with quantitative measures to assess the reliability of their measurement instruments, ensuring consistent and dependable measurement of the intended construct. In a research study, data coding involves systematically categorising or labelling information derived from articles and correlations. Initially, one coder independently conducted this process, resulting in 223 entries. Subsequently, a second coder reviewed a random sample of 100 entries to assess coding consistency. Due to the robust design of the coding procedure, it was less susceptible to personal biases or disagreements. The agreement level between the two coders was 97 %, \nindicating substantial consistency in data categorization. Instances of disagreement were resolved through mutual discussion, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the coding process. This meticulous approach ensures the accuracy and reliability of the coding process. \n\nStatistical procedures play a crucial role in analyzing and interpreting data in various fields of study. In the task context, the statistical procedures consist of three stages: weight analysis, effect size examination, and moderator analysis. These stages are essential for understanding the relationships and effects within a given dataset. Weight analysis is the first stage of the statistical procedures. It involves assigning weights to different variables or factors based on their importance or relevance in the analysis. This procedure helps prioritize certain variables and ensure they significantly impact the analysis (Tahir et al., 2021). Researchers can focus on the most influential factors by assigning appropriate weights and obtaining more accurate results. The second stage of the statistical procedure is the effect size examination. Effect size refers to the magnitude or strength of the relationship between variables. It provides a standardized measure of the effect, allowing researchers to compare the results across different studies or datasets. Effect size examination helps to determine the practical significance of the findings and assess the strength of the relationships (Blut et al., 2015). This stage is crucial in meta-analyses, where effect sizes from multiple studies are combined to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon under investigation (Zasuwa, 2017). The final stage of the statistical procedures is moderator analysis. Moderation refers to the influence of a third variable on the relationship between two other variables. Moderator analysis helps to identify and understand the conditions under which the relationship between variables changes or varies. It allows researchers to explore the factors that may influence the strength or direction of the relationship (Simbrunner and Schlegelmilch, 2017). By conducting moderator analysis, researchers can gain insights into the boundary conditions of the relationships and provide a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon. The statistical procedures of weight analysis, effect size examination, and moderator analysis are essential for rigorous and comprehensive data analysis. These procedures help researchers to prioritize variables, assess the strength of relationships, and identify the conditions under which relationships may vary. By following these procedures, researchers can ensure the validity and reliability of their findings and contribute to advancing knowledge in their respective fields. \n\nResearchers performed a weight analysis for each relationship described in the research design at the beginning of the study. The study also sought to ascertain how frequently each relationship was examined to highlight its significance in comprehending AV acceptance (Jeyaraj, 2002). Furthermore, the predictive power of a relationship was highlighted by its significant rate, which also revealed whether the results about the acceptance of AV were consistent or inconsistent. The weighted analysis was also used to reach a consensus regarding insignificant or contradictory linkages. The association was deemed questionable when the statistically significant ratio was under 80 per cent \n(Rana et al., 2015). ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2590198224000964-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 308, "text": "Analysis of effect size The random-effects model was preferred over the fixed-effects model when studies showed significant differences in technology, ethnic background, and demographic characteristics of participants (Jeyaraj and Dwivedi, 2020). Considering the broad spectrum of AV adoption studies conducted regarding sampling source and automation level, the present research used a random-effects model to combine correlations from different sources. The formula that follows is used for calculating the correlation coefficient's (r) Fischer's transformation: \n\nIn light of the observed variability in AV acceptance studies, especially concerning aspects like automated degree and sample origin, a random-effects model was used in this study to incorporate connections from various sources. This method enables a thorough analysis that considers potential differences in the information being analyzed. Given that the initial research might not involve the complete population, it is crucial to remember that pooled correlations can be affected by an error in sampling. Measurements inaccuracy may potentially have an impact on correlation coefficients (Hunter and Schmidt, 2004). We used Fisher's transform modified by sample size to obtain the overall effect size to address these problems and calculate the adjusted total. \n\nZadjusted = ∑*Wi⋅Zi* This section indicates accumulation, and Zadjusted reflects the combined Fisher transformations. Zi denotes the Fisher's transformation for that study, and Wi denotes the study's sample size. By integrating weighted Fisher's transformations, this formula takes sample sizes from different studies into assessment. \n\nThe cumulative effect size (rc) was computed using the formula: \n\nThis equation calculates the cumulative effect size based on the adjusted Fisher's transformations (Zadjusted). Where degrees of freedom (df) equals the number of studies minus one. Zi represents Fisher's transformations. \n\nQ =\n$\\dfrac{\\sum i\\textit{Wi}\\cdot\\textit{Zi}2-(\\sum i\\textit{Wi}\\cdot\\textit{Zi})2}{\\sum i\\textit{Wi}}$. \n\nMeta-Analysis based on publication Bias Publication bias, identified by Mayer et al. (2023), describes the inclination of researchers and journals to favour studies with positive or significant outcomes while overlooking those with negative or nonsignificant results. In autonomous vehicles, this bias carries profound implications for assessing their safety, effectiveness, and societal impact. \n\nParticularly in scenarios involving road accidents, where autonomous vehicles' decisions are compared to those of human drivers, there's a risk of moral evaluation bias, as Mayer et al. (2023) suggested. This bias could lead to overestimating human drivers' competency compared to autonomous vehicles. Such tendencies may skew perceptions of autonomous vehicle safety and reliability, potentially overshadowing their significant potential to reduce traffic fatalities and improve public health, as argued by Fleetwood (2017) and Pettigrew et al. (2018). \n\nMoreover, trust in autonomous vehicles, as proposed by Niu et al. \n\nSwitching gears to regression models in pet-related research, Chen \n(2019) introduce the PET model, which expands on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to analyze urban residents' pro-environment travel behaviour. Conversely, Peng et al. (2014) present the PESSE model, incorporating pet attachment into the TPB framework to explore pet inclusion in tourism activities. These models, alongside other regression analyses examining pet insurance demand and constraints on owner behaviour, provide nuanced insights into pet-related phenomena. \n\nLastly, meta-regression models like PET and PEESE, as delineated by Stanley and Doucouliagos (2014), offer valuable tools to evaluate publication bias and effect size. By applying these models, researchers can discern biases' impacts on research outcomes across various fields, ensuring a more robust and comprehensive understanding. In essence, navigating biases in research through appropriate statistical methodologies is essential for achieving accurate and holistic insights, whether in autonomous vehicles or pet-related phenomena. \n\nTable 4 summarises the statistical findings concerning the connections between the determinants of the intention to adopt AVs, as outlined in the research model. These relationships are categorized into three groups: Social influence Factors (social media, community interest), Product Related Factors (Functionality and reliability, Helpfulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness), and security factors (Product or service security and perceived risk). Notably, the average sample size for all nine relationships was surpassed, highlighting the robustness of the analysis. ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2590198224000964-main.md"}

As such, the analysis encompassed nine path coefficients corresponding to relationships H1a-H3b. Table 3 summarises the meta-analysis results, including combined effect size, confidence intervals, and heterogeneity statistics (Q and I2). The study's findings supported 8 out of the 10 investigated relationships; all technical parameters showed substantial relationships with the behavioural intention of using autonomous vehicles, except for the enabling condition \n(H3), supporting hypotheses H1a–H2c and H3b. The strongest predictor, perceived usefulness (H1b: =0.398; p0.001), appeared.

It gauges the extent to which measurements or data collection methods yield consistent results over time and across different conditions. A high level of reliability indicates that the variables are dependable and can be trusted to accurately represent the underlying constructs of interest. This is vital in drawing valid conclusions and making meaningful inferences from research findings. Researchers employ various techniques, such as test–retest reliability and internal consistency measures, to assess and enhance the reliability of their data, ultimately enhancing the credibility and validity of their research outcomes (Yang and Green, 2010). Table 5 summarises the reliability statistics for the ten variables in the research model. The constructs exhibit an average reliability that falls within the range of 0.839 to 0.913, comfortably exceeding the recommended threshold of 0.7. These elevated values serve as a strong validation of the constructs, confirming their robustness and consistency. This underscores their significant relevance within healthcare and autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, reinforcing their suitability for further analysis and interpretation (see Table 7). \n\nTable 7 Summary of Combined Reliability Estimates. \n\nConstruct No. of Studies Range Average Variance ", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2590198224000964-main.md"}

Researchers are increasingly interested in understanding this digital service's potential acceptance and uptake. Despite this interest, the extant literature lacks a comprehensive overview of various factors that play a role in its acceptance by target users. In this study, we aim to establish a current state of the art of MaaS user acceptance to inform practice in the effective design of related services, and to support the scientific community by offering future directions for their research. To achieve this, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of relevant empirical studies and analyzed the factors considered significant in MaaS acceptance by target users. Our in-depth analyses of these works resulted in several factors, which we grouped into three categories: traveler and trip characteristics, service and technology characteristics, and urban environment characteristics. Certain factors, such as age, trip frequency, MaaS bundle price, and transportation facility, were found to be consistent in their influence on MaaS\nacceptance. However, empirical works conflict regarding the influence of a number of factors, such as income and public transport card ownership. This study serves as a comprehensive source of the factors investigated in the literature to the moment and a basis for future research to improve our understanding of factors that require further investigation.\n\nIn the age of the digital revolution, technological advancements are influencing the field of urban mobility (Kamargianni and Matyas, 2017; Turetken et al., 2019a, 2019b). Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) has emerged as a digital innovation, creating changes in the mobility landscape (Mola et al., 2020). The use of MaaS as a smart mobility solution has the potential to capitalize on benefits, including reductions in consumption and emissions, and improvements in service and data access, which can result in the development of efficient and effective transportation services (Yigitcanlar and Kamruzzaman, 2019). While these benefits are contingent on the extent to which travelers transition to eco-friendly modes (Jang et al., 2021). It is important to acknowledge that MaaS implementation may introduce new challenges related to social equity, as highlighted by Groth (2019). Nevertheless, MaaS is generally considered a socially and environmentally efficient travel demand management tool with subscription plans customized to the users' preferences (Kamargianni and Matyas, 2017). Supporters of MaaS\nemphasize the role of MaaS in reducing private vehicle ownership and, eventually, transportation-related costs (Jittrapirom et al., 2017).\n\nThe notion of the MaaS emerged in the early 2010s as an integrated platform that provides customers with a wide range of mobility services by multiple mobility service operators (Heikkila, 2014). Instead of using multiple mobility platforms and separate individual modes, customers have the flexibility of using a single digital platform that combines and tailors mobility services to the customer's needs. The emerging literature provided several definitions of the topic as a distribution model that integrates a range of traditional and innovative transportation modes combined with transport services, such as booking, ticketing, payment, and travel recommendation (Jittrapirom et al., 2017; Kamargianni et al.,\n2016; Sochor et al., 2015a).", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2772424724000027-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 320, "text": "As a result of an increase in popularity, MaaS research is growing significantly. While this increase is expanding the understanding of the topic, there is a large set of factors that play a role in influencing users' decisions to accept, adopt, and use MaaS solutions. Although several factors show similar influence on user acceptance, some are underrepresented or reveal different influencing signals, resulting in inconsistent outcomes among the various empirical studies. For instance, the average annual income was found to influence MaaS adoption both negatively\n(Farahmand et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021a; Ko et al., 2021; Matyas and Kamargianni, 2021) and positively (Agbe and Shiomi, 2021; Brezovec and Hampl, 2021; Caiati et al., 2020). Another interesting factor is car use, which was revealed to influence MaaS acceptance both negatively\n(Fioreze et al., 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Mulley et al., 2020) and positively\n(Brezovec and Hampl, 2021; Ho et al., 2018). This results in the disorientation of future empirical work and potentially delays the diffusion of MaaS.\n\nThe extant literature offers a wide range of empirical studies and review articles focusing on the user perspective, willingness, or intention to pay and adopt MaaS. However, the majority of these studies do not rely on a structured review of the existing literature in settling for these factors (e.g., Caiati et al. (2020); Hoerler et al. (2020); Polydoropoulou et al. (2020a); Ye et al. (2020)) or focus on a selected number of factors given their interest in a particular theory or a set of factors (e.g., Alonso-Gonzalez et al. (2020); Mola et al. (2020); Schikofsky et al. (2020)). In brief, the available literature is limited as it takes a particular stance in analyzing the influential factors. Therefore, there is a need to synthesize and extend the research on MaaS acceptance and examine the indicators used in empirical studies to understand their influence on users' decisions on the acceptance and adoption of MaaS. To the best of our knowledge, no structured literature review provides a comprehensive overview of all factors reported in the literature on the user acceptance of MaaS. Therefore, we pose the following research questions for our study:\n1) What factors have the current literature considered influential on the user acceptance/adoption of MaaS?\n\nConsequently, the broad aim of this study is to establish a foundation for future research by building on empirical research directed toward MaaS acceptance. Our work not only considers the influential factors but also examines the actual impact of each factor on user acceptance.\n\nTo answer our research questions, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR), studying empirical works investigating the factors that influence MaaS user acceptance. To locate these studies, we searched the Web of Science digital library for the articles published between 2010 and 2022. From 363 peer-reviewed journal articles that were initially retrieved, 51 were finally selected, given the selection criteria of this study. These studies were thoroughly analyzed to identify their objective, methodology, investigated factors, and findings. As a result, this research builds on a comprehensive set of empirically investigated factors and aims to serve as a reference point for future research on user acceptance of MaaS.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the MaaS concept and key insights into individual adoption in the mobility field. Section 3 presents the research design of this study. Next, the key findings of the literature review and the factors influencing MaaS\nadoption are presented in Section 4. This is followed by a discussion of our findings and directions for future research in Section 5. We conclude with a summary of the findings and limitations of our study in Section 6.\n\nIn this section, we briefly present a background to the concept of MaaS and discuss related works that involved literature reviews on several concepts around MaaS, particularly on the factors potentially influencing its acceptance.\n\nMaaS has attracted worldwide attention and witnessed a number of successful trials in several countries (Boer, et al., 2022a; Butler et al., 2021; Jittrapirom et al., 2017). Several MaaS initiatives were launched, such as Whim in Finland, UbiGo in Sweden, Moovel in Germany (Jittrapirom et al., 2017), and Mobility4All in North America (Lopez-Carreiro et al., 2020).", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2772424724000027-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 321, "text": "Although various authors attempted to define MaaS (Arias-Molinares and García-Palomares, 2020), the core elements of MaaS are considered to revolve around a single platform that provides real-time information on available private or public modes in a specific region, multi-modal transportation, that integrates planning, booking, and payment for mobility needs and personalized packages (Athanasopoulou et al., 2022a; Sarasini et al., 2017). The transportation modes offered by the MaaS platform are not limited to public transportation. They can include taxis, car-sharing, ridesharing, bike-sharing (Hoerler et al., 2020), electric scooters, and motorcycles (Stromberg et al., 2018 € ), allowing for multimodal trip options based on user choices with a seamless combination of public and private transportation options without needing a private car or ownership of cards from different service providers (Boijens et al.,\n2021; Utriainen and Poll € €anen, 2018).\n\nThe younger generation showed increased interest in changing technology trends and increased use of ride-sourcing apps (Casey et al., 2017). MaaS represents a new way of offering transport services to users\n(Arias-Molinares and García-Palomares, 2020). It provides a system with a wide set of mobility services that allow users to plan, pay, and access their mobility requirements any time they want in a single app (Kamargianni and Goulding, 2018). As a result of the development of the system and increased interest in MaaS, previous research has addressed its importance in promoting change in the transport sector (Alonso--\nGonzalez et al., 2020; Jittrapirom et al., 2017; Kamargianni and Goulding, 2018; Matyas and Kamargianni, 2019a).\n\nThe traveler - the MaaS user - is the leading actor in the MaaS\necosystem (Arias-Molinares and García-Palomares, 2020). MaaS places travelers at the center of transport services by providing them with tailored mobility solutions that fulfill their expectations (Ho et al., 2018).\n\nThis provides users easy access to appropriate modes of transport included in a package with flexible and personalized options tailored to user needs and offers an interesting alternative to private car ownership (MaaS Alliance, 2019). A MaaS platform may cover any available mobility operator to provide flexible, convenient, and personalized travel options for different users (Kamargianni et al., 2016). However, most journey planners available for users do not combine more than one transport mode (except walking to reach the final destination) (Kamargianni and Matyas, 2017). This means that for users to travel from one destination to another, they must use transport modes run by different operators and accept particular modes of payment (cash, cards, PayPal, etc.). In this case, the user is not able to access all these modes with just one interface or smart card; this problem restricts the spread of inter-modality, that is, using two or more transport modes in one trip; and multimodality, which refers to the use of different transport modes for different trips. The research indicates that about 40% of adults are willing to adopt MaaS under the condition that their mobility needs will be met and that the MaaS expenditures will be lowered (Kamargianni and Goulding, 2018; Liljamo et al., 2020; Vij et al., 2020).\n\nTo date, several review articles focusing on MaaS have been published. A bibliographic review by Arias-Molinares and García-Palomares\n(2020) focuses on the definition of MaaS, identifying its main actors, and understanding the motivations behind its implementation. In their study, they review 57 MaaS-related articles and conclude that the field is still encountering various developments that delay reaching a unified definition of MaaS. Although the paper provides a holistic view of what MaaS\nis, who the main actors are, and how it can be implemented, it does not investigate the effect of user preferences and travel behavior on the acceptance and adoption of MaaS. The review by Utriainen and Poll € €anen\n(2018), which includes 31 scientific articles, focuses on the role of different transport modes on MaaS, ongoing pilots and trials, and the effects of MaaS. They address various MaaS schemes in the literature without tapping into their direct impact on acceptance. Butler et al.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2772424724000027-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 322, "text": "The literature also features reviews that investigate the influencing factors. The SLR by Pham et al. (2021) studies the indicators and the interactions between users, service providers, and platform operators. From 50 peer-reviewed articles, they present the interactions among three types of stakeholders (grouped as demand side and supply side) under the impacts of physical and psychological indicators/factors. However, their work does not consider the effect of a broad set of factors on MaaS acceptance and adoption. Calderon and Miller (2020)  focus on the supply side of mobility services and present a literature review on the insights at the conceptual, operational, and modeling levels. Their review points out that mobility services have a high degree of generality and that human factors should be better considered during the modeling efforts.\n\nAnother review by Butler et al. (2021) focuses on barriers and risks associated with MaaS adoption in cities. Their study includes 91 peer-reviewed articles focused on outcomes and risks, and demand-side and supply-side barriers. Their findings show that MaaS does not appeal to older generations, public transport users, or private vehicle users.\n\nAlthough the study focuses closely on adoption from the demand side, it does not tackle the comprehensive list of factors affecting MaaS acceptance.\n\nThe study by Lopez-Carreiro et al. (2021a) confirms the wide agreement in the literature that the success of MaaS is reliant on travelers' engagement. However, limited studies have explored why and how individuals accept and adopt MaaS. A few empirical works focus on users' intention to use and willingness to adopt MaaS (Ko et al., 2021; Lopez-Carreiro et al., 2021a, 2021b; Ye et al., 2020). The study by Lopez-Carreiro et al. (2021b) applies the technology acceptance model\n(TAM) theory to explore individuals' willingness to adopt MaaS with the support of a systematic literature review focusing on attitudinal factors.\n\nAnother important set of studies focuses on the willingness to pay (Liljamo et al., 2020; Tsouros et al., 2021). These works, however, do not rely on systematic reviews.\n\nIn a similar line, several empirical studies investigate the different user characteristics and segments and their potential to adopt MaaS (Feneri et al., 2022 Schikofsky et al., 2020; Zijlstra et al., 2020). User preferences for MaaS bundles and their intention to subscribe are also addressed in the literature (Ho et al., 2021). The pricing schemes are investigated to understand the user preference for MaaS (Feneri et al., 2022). Several studies are built on MaaS pilots to understand user choices. For instance, the UbiGo platform in Sweden was tested to understand user choices and future decisions (Sochor et al., 2016) and how it influenced travel behavior (Stromberg et al., 2018 € ). Other important influential factors are the user expectations of the MaaS service, which helps in the design of MaaS schemes (Lopez-Carreiro et al., 2020; Polydoropoulou et al., 2020a), and the readiness of users to change their\n \ntravel behavior (Hensher et al., 2021; Storme et al., 2020), and travel habits towards available travel modes (Fioreze et al., 2019; Kim et al.,\n2021b). Lastly, user expectations, preferences, and motivations are found to be important in driving the adoption of MaaS services (Lopez-Carreiro et al., 2021b). The findings of these studies focus on a wide set of variables that extend to the transport modes and transport infrastructure in particular regions.\n\nIn conclusion, despite several empirical works on various aspects of MaaS, the research and practice of MaaS still require a comprehensive and systematic review of the factors that have been empirically studied in the literature, along with their respective influence on the acceptance of MaaS. This paper aims to address this need.\n\nIn conducting our review, we adopted the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007) for performing systematic literature reviews (SLRs).

We present our research problem, objective, and questions in the introduction section of this paper. In step 3, we conducted several pilot searches to review the scope and refine the search string we used to locate relevant studies in digital libraries. Subsequently, we selected the Web of Science digital library as our primary data source (step 5) to identify relevant studies, as it is known to cover venues that publish high-quality papers that are most relevant to the objective of our study (Wohlin, 2014).\n\nAfter several iterations of pilot searches, we adopted a broad\n\nUsing this search string in the Web of Science resulted in 509 articles prior to applying the inclusions and exclusion criteria as explained in step 6.\n\nIn step 6, based on our research objective and questions, we defined the inclusion and exclusion criteria for selecting the primary studies. Articles that were not MaaS and adoption-focused were excluded from the selection, in addition to articles that were from a different field of study (such as mathematics, remote sensing, computer science, and automation control systems). Table 1 presents these criteria.\n\nThe main search (step 7) was performed for articles published in academic journals between 2010 and 2022. The query string was applied to the title, abstract, and keywords of the publications, reducing the number of articles to 363 articles. In step 8, the complete list of articles was screened against the established inclusion/exclusion criteria. The screenings were performed by one of the authors of this work and subsequently checked independently by the other authors for confirmation.\n\nThe differences in the views regarding included or excluded articles were discussed until a consensus was reached. Step 8 resulted in 45 articles for further investigation.\n\nIn step 9, we performed the forward snowballing technique proposed by Wohlin (2014) to locate relevant works that cited one or more of these 45 articles but were not found in our search on the Web of Science. With the addition of 9 articles, the total number increased to 54 articles. After analyzing the full text of the articles to ensure their proper alignment with the topic and focus of the study, the finalized list included 51 articles. The final step involved extracting and analyzing the key factors and their operationalizations in each empirical study, including the data collection method and the results of the studies in terms of the impact each factor has on the acceptance of MaaS.\n\nIn this section, we present the general findings of our review by outlining the distribution of MaaS-related articles in the existing literature. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the primary studies published in peer-reviewed journals (the earliest from 2015 and the latest to 2022).\n\nThe 51 articles included in this review show that the interest in the topic started growing in the past 4 years and has reached its current peak in 2020 with 21 studies.\n\nMost of the reviewed studies (n ¼ 35) were conducted across Europe, reflecting European researchers' interest in the MaaS topic. This could be related to the fact that most implemented trials were conducted in Europe (Sakai, 2019) (some of the studies included multiple countries). Furthermore, the studies focusing on user acceptance of MaaS showed a noticeable increase also in Australia and East Asia, reflecting the maturity of the technology and the advancements that it has been partaking in.\n\nThe list of articles, study region, and data collection method used per study is listed in Appendix A.\n\nTable 2 lists the sources and the number of empirical studies listed in each source. Among the 51 empirical studies, most of the studies (i.e., 17 articles) are published in the journal of Transportation Research part A: Policy and Practice. Of the remaining 31 articles, Travel Behavior and\n \nSociety journal corresponded to the second highest publication with 6 studies, followed by 4 publications in the Transportation Research Record and Transportation. The rest of the journal publications are spread over 15 different journals. Most of the reviewed empirical studies are published in journals with a transportation focus, showing the increased interest in the MaaS topic in the field.\n\nMost of the reviewed empirical studies relied on quantitative data collection methods, such as surveys (n ¼ 48). The use of interviews for data collection was the second highest with n ¼ 7, followed by focus groups (n ¼ 5).

{"doc_id": 324, "text": "This section discusses the results from the reviewed empirical studies and outlines the factors that have been studied in extant literature. Following a consensus-building approach (Susskind et al., 1999) and relying on the comprehensive review of the existing literature, we have undergone multiple rounds of discussions and iterations for categorizing these factors. The consensus-building approach is a collaborative method that can be used to categorize concepts into meaningful clusters by facilitating discussions and achieving agreement among a group of individuals (Susskind et al., 1999). While reviewing each factor, we initiated the process of forming groupings based on the shared characteristics and relationships among the factors. In cases where a factor could not be readily assigned to an existing category, a new category was established.\n\nThis process continued until all 71 factors were thoroughly analyzed and discussed, and a consensus was reached among the authors.\n\nAs a result, we grouped the factors into three categories: the traveler and trip characteristics, the service and technology characteristics, and the urban environment characteristics. Table 3 shows the list of all factors under these categories, followed by Tables 4–6, presenting in more detail the definitions and results of the factors investigated in the primary studies. Detailed mapping of primary studies and factors is shown in Appendix B.\n\nThis section discusses the key results of this paper. First, we focus on the factors that are deemed most and least influential. The factors encompass those for which empirical research is in unanimous agreement regarding their positive or negative impact (or lack of impact). We delve into a number of these factors that have been extensively studied, as indicated by the abundance of research papers reporting their analysis. Following that, we also elaborate on those factors that have been studied frequently but have yielded contradicting results in empirical studies (We designated a factor as contradictory if there was at least one study indicating a positive or negative influence that contradicted the findings of\n\nTable 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the SLR.\n\nInclusion criterion Exclusion criterion\n\nAge is among the key socio-demographic factors when evaluating the expectations of MaaS technologies (Casey et al., 2017). Results show that it has a negative impact on the willingness to pay (Brezovec and Hampl, 2021; Ho et al., 2020; Vij et al., 2020), intention to use (Fioreze et al.,\n2019), and stated preferences (Kim et al., 2021b). Therefore, it is anticipated that younger generations will be more inclined to adopt the service compared to older generations. On the other hand, it is recognized that the demand for travel and trip frequency (Farahmand et al., 2021)) and the inclination to adopt emerging technologies (Lopez-Carreiro et al., 2021a; Ye et al., 2020) vary across different age groups. Hence, it is important to not solely emphasize the overall influence of specific socio-economic indicators in isolation but also to investigate the variances in the factors that either facilitate or obstruct MaaS acceptance among diverse demographic groups. An interesting avenue for further research lies in the exploration of divergent determinants that shape the\n\nUnderstanding the nuanced factors that influence MaaS acceptance within these age groups can shed light on how technology preferences, travel habits, and socio-economic considerations vary, offering valuable insights for the development of targeted strategies to promote MaaS\nadoption and meet the diverse needs of these demographic segments\n(Caiati et al., 2020).\n\nAs indicated above, the socio-economic and demographic factors\n(Alonso-Gonzalez et al., 2020; Feneri et al., 2022; Fioreze et al., 2019; Zijlstra et al., 2020) have a significant influence on the acceptance of MaaS. Several primary studies that investigated trip frequency agreed that this factor positively influences MaaS acceptance. In that case, older generations perform fewer trips than younger individuals (Kim et al., 2021b). Zijlstra et al. (2020) discuss that individuals who frequently use public transportation are more likely to adopt MaaS. Car ownership (as a type of vehicle ownership) revealed a negative association with MaaS\nacceptance (Alonso-Gonzalez et al., 2020; Alyavina et al., 2020). A\nsimilar factor that was also heavily investigated is the availability of a car for personal use. This factor goes beyond the ownership of a private vehicle yet explores whether cars available in the household are frequently used. Most of the primary studies agreed that frequent car users are less likely to adopt MaaS (Fioreze et al., 2019; Ho et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2021a) or are less likely to select complex MaaS plans (Tsouros et al., 2021).", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2772424724000027-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 325, "text": "At the technology level, the cost of MaaS is among the most influential factors and the most significant factors in attracting potential users, especially car users (Casey et al., 2017). All the primary studies agreed that cost has a negative influence on the acceptance and use of MaaS. The convenience of advance booking and flexibility of choosing a mobility mode and selecting packages (Fioreze et al., 2019; Polydoropoulou et al., 2020a). Concerning the platform features, planning is considered the most important feature that positively influences the acceptance of MaaS.\n\nIndividuals who use route planners on a weekly basis are more likely to adopt MaaS (Fioreze et al., 2019).\n\nAt the urban environment level, the factors related to the transportation facility are among the most influential factors when it comes to MaaS acceptance. Matyas and Kamargianni (2021) discuss that MaaS\npackages are not a viable option for individuals living in the suburbs and needing proper access to transportation. Another highly investigated factor is the residential type, by which the majority of the empirical studies agreed that potential adopters of MaaS mostly live in densely populated urban areas (Alonso-Gonzalez et al., 2020; Liljamo et al.,\n2020), or in high-income zones (Lopez-Carreiro et al., 2021a).\n\nAt the traveler level, gender is found insignificant in influencing the propensity to adopt MaaS (Feneri et al., 2022; Liljamo et al., 2020; Schikofsky et al., 2020), with little influence on the willingness to pay for particular MaaS bundles. Factors such as the mode of egress time, waiting time in the station, mode access time, parking time, and search time for parking are investigated in very few studies and either have a low or no direct influence on the acceptance of MaaS. They rather affect the perceived utility of a particular transport mode. For instance, they weigh whether a shared vehicle would be a better option than a private car if the egress time is higher (Krauss et al., 2022). Traveling with strangers is investigated in a single study and found to negatively influence the acceptance of MaaS (Fioreze et al., 2019).\n\nSimilarly, crowding is found insignificant in its influence on mode choice (Krauss et al., 2022). These factors might be an outcome of other factors, such as the extent to which an individual is open to trying different modes to reach their destination or whether they are stricter regarding their habits and choices. At the technology level, social media appeared only in a few studies (Lopez-Carreiro et al., 2020; Polydoropoulou et al., 2020a) and did not show importance in the intention to use MaaS packages. Given the importance of social media in our daily lives, social networks and social influence may require more thorough empirical work.\n\nThe primary studies showed that public transportation card ownership has both a negative (e.g., [S1]) and a positive (e.g., [S29]) influence on the individual willingness to pay for MaaS service (Caiati et al., 2020; Karlsson et al., 2016). Income also shows contradicting results in the primary studies investigated. For instance, the studies [S5], [S34], and [S45] report that the individuals of higher income are more likely to adopt MaaS. However, other primary studies contradicted this result.\n\nThey indicate that individuals of lower income have fewer private vehicles and, therefore, have a higher intention to use MaaS and select multimodal plans (Kim et al., 2021b; Matowicki et al., 2022). As for the household composition, larger households or households with children have higher acceptance of MaaS and are more likely to pay for the service (Vij et al., 2020; Zijlstra et al., 2020). However, a few studies show that travelers living alone (Alonso-Gonzalez et al., 2020; Lopez-Carreiro et al.,\n2021a) or with fewer than two children (Ho et al., 2018) are the most likely adopters of MaaS.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2772424724000027-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 326, "text": "Some studies found trip duration as an insignificant factor for the intention to use MaaS (Ho et al., 2021; Ko et al., 2021). Feneri et al. (2022) found that an increase in trip duration leads to a decrease in bike sharing mode in a MaaS. Future research should investigate this factor further by considering the transport mode and whether the transfers are included in the trip duration. Many studies indicate public transport card ownership as a factor with a positive influence on selecting a MaaS plan, especially if it includes public transportation as an option (Alonso--\nGonzalez et al., 2020; Lopez-Carreiro et al., 2021b; Matyas and Kamargianni, 2019b). However, some studies found a negative influence of commuter pass ownership on MaaS subscriptions (Krauss et al., 2022; Mulley et al., 2020) and willingness to pay (Agbe and Shiomi, 2021).\n\nAt the user characteristics level, the trip purpose is among the factors that led to contradictory outcomes and require further investigation. Individuals taking many leisure trips are likelier to adopt MaaS (Butler et al., 2020). For instance, individuals with flexible working schedules or who are unemployed are more likely to have a different trip pattern and less consistency in travel time, purpose, and destination.\n\nAt the technology level, assistance and enhancing services were tested only in a few studies. Understanding the elements that enhance the MaaS\nservice and assist the users in easing the traveling experience can make the service more attractive to a broad segment of users. The payment type also showed different preferences for users. In a few studies, individuals preferred a pay-as-you-go option in MaaS (Karlsson et al., 2016; Matyas and Kamargianni, 2021). Individuals who seek high convenience choose a fixed contract with flexible termination (Brezovec and Hampl, 2021).\n\nHence, further research is required to investigate the interplay between diverse payment types and MaaS acceptance.\n\nAs for the urban environment, limited results were found in the primary studies on the role of social influence on the acceptance of MaaS.\n\nAltay and Okumus¸ (2022) and Kim and Rasouli (2022) found that social influence has a positive effect on the willingness to use MaaS, while the study by Hoerler et al. (2020) indicates an insignificant effect of peers, which is considered a key part of the social influence factor. It is evident that each local context should be highlighted and investigated further in terms of the available mobility services, especially those delay individuals from adopting MaaS.\n\nGiven the differences in culture, socio-economic, and political characteristics that shape the mobility domain in different countries (Caiati et al., 2020), it is also important to further investigate the lifestyle and cultural differences between users in different countries or regions of a country. Public transportation and cycling are part of the everyday life of individuals in a number of European countries, such as the Netherlands, while the infrastructure and lifestyle of individuals show significant differences in countries such as Australia and USA, where private cars play an essential role. The availability and quality level of transport facilities (Kim et al., 2021a) and other factors regarding the urban environment and established mobility culture (Matyas and Kamargianni, 2019a) exhibit substantial diversity from one country or region to another. Hence, a promising avenue for exploration entails conducting a comprehensive examination and comparative analysis, utilizing insights from prior studies, to illuminate the regional disparities.\n\nIn collaboration with private entities, governmental bodies play an important role in building and facilitating the uptake of new services that use the latest technology to make MaaS a viable option for citizens. The development of a real-time computing platform provides swift and reliable support for the users with the aim of increasing the trust and convenience of service (Butler et al., 2021; Kamargianni et al., 2016).\n\nIncorporating autonomous vehicles into public transportation and shared mobility services brings additional challenges and factors that require further studies (Goodall et al., 2017). In such settings, for instance, safety would be critical for user acceptance and for public and private institutions to ensure within their urban landscape.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2772424724000027-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 327, "text": "It is essential to acknowledge that the worldwide implementation of MaaS is an ongoing endeavor. Consequently, current studies have predominantly focused on comprehending the preferences and perceptions of potential MaaS users, relying heavily on scenario-based methods to collect this information. Given the current maturity of the service and the limited number of MaaS platforms in operation, it is still challenging to measure the actual adoption of MaaS. Hence, future research should also aim at investigating the level of alignment between these findings and the factors influencing real-world adoption and use. More implementations in different contextual settings will provide room to study the adoption rates of the individuals based on their real experience.\n\nAs a system that aims to provide customers with a comprehensive range of mobility services (Heikkila, 2014), MaaS shows great potential for reshaping the mobility domain and promoting flexible multimodal mobility (Caiati et al., 2020). In this paper, we aim to provide an understanding of the factors that potentially influence the acceptance of MaaS and pinpoint areas for future research. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of 51 empirical works. A thorough analysis of these works yielded 71 factors that potentially play a role in MaaS acceptance and adoption. We categorized them into three main groups related to (1) traveler and trip characteristics, (2) service and technology characteristics, and (3) urban environment characteristics. We elaborate on the findings regarding each factor and discuss the results to provide a baseline for future research.\n\nOur review has identified several factors that are proven to have a significant influence on MaaS acceptance. However, there are different sets of factors that appeared in several studies and showed an influence on the willingness to pay or intention to adopt. Acceptance of MaaS is influenced by a combination of (1) user characteristics and traveler attributes, such as car ownership, frequency of travel, or the use of multimodality services; (2) service and technology, such as the impact of mobility costs, platform features, and assistance, and the use of different transport modes; and (3) urban environment, such as the residential area of the user and the efficiency of transportation infrastructure.\n\nSome factors were intensively studied in the literature, such as the socio-demographic factors (Hensher et al., 2021; Ho et al., 2018; Lopez-Carreiro et al., 2020; Mulley et al., 2020) and costs (Agbe and Shiomi, 2021; Brezovec and Hampl, 2021; Kim et al., 2021b; Liljamo et al., 2020), whereas other factors, such as convenience (Karlsson et al.,\n2016; Matyas and Kamargianni, 2021) and social influence (Hoerler et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020) are the focus of fewer empirical works. These studies also point out that several respondents still value and prefer a\n \nprivate car with the burden of ownership over alternative modes of transportation (Kim et al., 2021a). When MaaS becomes capable of ful-filling the daily mobility needs of individuals living in different areas\n(suburban and urban), individuals will become more comfortable in changing their choices (Utriainen and Poll € €anen, 2018).\n\nMaaS becomes interesting in terms of sustainable people-centered mobility when multimodal transport modes are integrated using additional digital services, and users get easy access to the mobility services without having to think about the means of transport or the respective providers. A major responsibility lies with cities, municipalities, and states, which must create an appropriate framework for MaaS (Moller €\net al., 2019; Pankratz et al., 2018). In addition to technical and infrastructural measures, a MaaS framework should also include rules and policies to ensure meaningful integration of public and private MaaS\nofferings and the highest level of accessibility and affordability for these offerings. Once again, open collaboration between all local, regional, and national stakeholders is essential to establish trust among the actors of the MaaS ecosystem (Boer et al., 2022b; Jittrapirom et al., 2020).\n\nThis study contributes to both research and practice. Researchers will find this work useful as a comprehensive source that presents the factors investigated in the literature and points out areas where future research can focus. Our study shows that there is still a limited understanding of the interplay between many factors and their influence on MaaS acceptance. By studying, categorizing, and describing these factors, our review also contributes to the consistency and coherence in operationalizing them, thereby furthering the rigor of future empirical works in this field.", "filename": "1-s2.0-S2772424724000027-main.md"}
{"doc_id": 328, "text": "Practitioners will also consider this study valuable as it serves as a pointer to the factors that should be considered and tackled in the design and implementation of new MaaS platforms. For instance, the factors related to the urban environment reveal an important aspect that shows individuals living in cities and areas that have a good transportation infrastructure are inclined to switch from using their private vehicles to using MaaS (Butler et al., 2021). However, in rural areas or areas where the public transport system is underutilized and lacks sufficient coverage, individuals find it hard to stop using their private vehicles (Dick et al.,\n2020). In this case, a different mode of transportation that is affordable and provides a reasonable connection time should be explored. The government may need to provide subsidies in collaboration with the businesses that offer such mobility modes to achieve greater acceptance and coverage. At the technology level, the price of MaaS packages is among the critical factors influencing the acceptance of the service. Therefore, policies focusing on the financial element that shows private vehicles and unsustainable choices as costly and expensive will trigger individuals over time to switch to a better alternative.\n\nThe limitations of this research are related mainly to the underlying research method of the conducted systematic literature review. Given the research objective of this paper, we relied only on empirical studies. The inclusion and exclusion criteria used to locate relevant works limited the type of studies to be reviewed thoroughly. Furthermore, this study excluded books, conference proceedings, and gray literature (such as white papers, consultant reports, and magazine articles). Including a wider set of published works (e.g., by searching digital libraries other than Web-of-Science, such as Scopus) can positively contribute to a broader understanding of the influential factors on MaaS. However, we accommodated this limitation by conducting forward snowballing on the primary set of peer-reviewed articles iteratively to locate relevant works published in other channels. Since there is an ongoing flow of new research published on different channels, it is important to update the current work to reflect the latest findings regarding the influential factors of MaaS acceptance and use.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\nAppendix B.

AI is not a new phenomenon, but it is a topic that has recently been gaining greater attention and is becoming more common in our work and social lives than ever before.\n\nThere are many benefits AI can bring to the highways and transportation industry, especially when it comes to improving safety, providing more insightful transport planning, and efficient asset management, as well as improving the way the public experiences transport systems.\n\nWhen it comes to decarbonisation, there are already examples of data and AI being used to:\n\nHowever, there are also barriers we must overcome if \n\nAI is to be widely adopted in our industry, including:\n **Lack of skills and understanding**, especially when it comes to people who specialise in data/AI and possess transportation sector knowledge.\n\nThis report intends to serve as an introduction to AI \nfor the highways and transportation sector. We hope you gain a better understanding of what AI is, the importance of data for creating successful AI outputs, where AI is already being used in the transport sector, where it is likely heading, and what needs to be done to accelerate successful AI adoption.\n\nTwo of the most significant topics of conversation within the transport sector at the moment are decarbonisation and AI. Decarbonisation is a cornerstone of government policy, and it is critical in our ability to tackle climate change and achieve net zero. AI is heralded as a revolutionary approach that has the potential to accelerate our transport decarbonisation ambition in many ways. However, when it comes to awareness and understanding about AI, most transportation professionals have very limited knowledge about its development and application.\n\nHence, at the start of 2023, CIHT established a project group, made up of representatives from the CIHT \nPartnership Network and Technical Champions, to gather industry knowledge on the current state and use of AI and its future potential. Through early meetings of the group, it became clear that the scope of the work should be extended to incorporate \n\"transport data\" (given AI is so dependent on proven data), \nand that the focus of our work should be on the role that AI \nplays in helping to decarbonise our transport system. This ensures a clear purpose to the work and avoids the risk of studying \"technology for technology's sake\".", "filename": "dataai.md"}
{"doc_id": 335, "text": "This report sets out the findings and aims of the group to raise awareness of the current and future potential of AI \nand its application in relation to the decarbonisation of the transport system. We hope it acts as a starting point for further research and discussion among transportation professionals, helps to raise awareness and knowledge in this emerging area, and signposts some examples of best practice to help inspire and articulate how AI \nmight best be used to help decarbonise transport in the years to come.\n\nThe definition of AI is often derived from combining the definitions of \"artificial\" (created by people) and \n\"intelligence\" (able to learn and understand things easily). However, dictionary definitions of AI are often limited because they tend to refer to specific applications. \n\nFor example:\nThe study of how to produce machines that have some of the qualities that the human mind has, such as the ability to understand language, recognise pictures, solve problems, and learn.\n\nBroadly speaking, the primary functions of AI can be grouped into three main areas:\nA lot of AI systems will use machine learning to perform the tasks described above. However, not all AI systems will do so and it is important to know the difference between machine learning and AI.\n\nThroughout this report we will feature various case \n\nHowever, it should be noted that the use of case studies here is not to recommend or advocate for the featured product or service over its competitors \n- they are merely used to build a picture of where we currently are as an industry and to help bring some AI \nconcepts to life.\n\nTo help the reader better navigate this report, we have put together a list of common technical terms used when discussing data and AI.\n\nAI systems heavily rely on the data fed into them to build a picture of the world, and they use this to provide users with the output asked for. Simply put, data is at the heart of any AI system.\n\nA recent CIHT survey found that most respondents utilised data on traffic flow and congestion, and that the most common ways of collecting data were through surveys or sensors.*\n\nFigure 1: Responses given through a CIHT survey to the questions \"How do you collect the transport data you use\" (open text answers) and \"What types of transport data do you currently have access to in your work?\" \n(multiple-choice answers)\nThe quality and quantity of data fed into an AI system play a significant role in how accurate the outputs will be. The saying \"garbage in, garbage out\" when using computers to solve real-world problems still applies with AI, as incomplete and inconsistent data will introduce uninformed, biased answers.\n\nThe importance of data quality is heightened in a dynamic area such as transport, where impacts such as public holidays, weather, events, and strikes, among other instances, mean the networks we want to study and manage are never as easy to understand as it might first appear. Transport networks are subject to great variability, even without recent influences such as COVID-related travel pattern changes, e-mobility, and economic changes.\n\nTraditionally, transport has relied on disparate and limited data sources, often leading to assumptionsbased decision-making (data poor, assumption rich). \n\nHowever, the modern landscape offers a wealth of new data services and sources, which can supplement existing data and aid in creating a more comprehensive understanding of transport-related challenges. An example of some data services already available are:\n The Bus Open Data Service, providing real-time bus locations across England every 20–30 seconds.\n\nThese data sets and sources can be used to enhance data coverage, fulfilling a \"big data\" approach that integrates diverse and complementary data sets, such as roadworks, incident data, and weather information, providing a more holistic understanding of a transport network. Once these data sets are established as big data, AI can then be used to help solve prevalent transport challenges.\n\nIn early 2023, DfT published its new Transport Data Strategy, which sets out how DfT will work with and support the transport sector to harness the benefits of data to help grow and level up the economy, reduce environmental impacts, and improve transport for users.\n\nThe Transport Data Strategy also outlined a series of barriers identified by DfT as preventing widespread innovation in the sector. In a recent CIHT survey* on the Future of Transport Data we asked respondents to state how much these barriers were preventing innovation in their job roles. We have ordered the barriers below from most preventing to least preventing, based on the results of this survey:\n **Data standards and quality**. Data is not held in recognised, consistent, standard formats, making it hard to use for live services.\n\nThere is a lack of incentives to invest in and make data available for most of the organisations who hold, or could easily collect, vital transport data, as the benefits typically accrue to the data aggregators and developers who build and offer services using this data.", "filename": "dataai.md"}
{"doc_id": 336, "text": "To overcome these barriers, DfT put forward five themes and corresponding mission statements that it believes will enable innovation. Based on the results of the CIHT Future of Transport Data survey,* we have listed these themes and mission statements in order of what our survey respondents felt would be the most effective.\n\nThe highways and transportation sector is currently on a journey towards AI (Figure 2). To be able to have the skills and resources necessary to implement AI, \nwe must first focus on what data we have available to us, specifically the provenance, quantity, and quality of that data. Once this is established, we can then look at how we use this data. Depending on what point an organisation is at on its \"data maturity journey\" this could be using the data for simple reporting (descriptive analysis - what happened?), or to give more in-depth strategic insights (diagnostic insights - why did this happen?). Advancing on this, data can be used for scenario planning (predictive analysis - what might happen in the future?). In the most advanced cases, AI \ncan be used to perform these tasks autonomously, or at a speed that allows decisions to be taken in real time.\n\nData Maturity\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the current journey of the highways and transportation sector towards use of AI\n* For further insights into the results of this survey, please see the Appendix 10   11\n\nThe UK government has ambitious plans to become a world leader in AI technology and is currently one of the top three countries in the Global AI Index - a benchmark of nations' levels of AI investment, innovation, and implementation. To achieve its vision to \"remain an AI \nand science superpower fit for the next decade\" the UK \ngovernment produced a National AI Strategy in 2021, which sets out three outcomes to be achieved:\n Investing in the long-term needs of the AI \necosystem through: - Supporting researchers and entrepreneurs\n- Ensuring the UK has a diverse range of people with AI \nskills\n- Ensuring innovators have access to the data and computing resources\n- Supporting growth for AI through a pro-innovation business environment\n- Ensuring UK AI developers can access markets around the world.\n\nSince the publication of the National AI Strategy, the UK \ngovernment has released an AI Action Plan, to be updated annually, which will set out how it plans to achieve the above outcomes, as well as the progress that has been made so far.\n\nSome notable highlights from the 2022 progress update were:\n DfT committed to developing safety and cyber security in connected and automated mobility (CAM) via the Centre for Controlled and Autonomous Vehicles.\n\nSince then, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero published an AI for Decarbonisation Innovation Programme, which supports the development of innovative AI technologies for decarbonisation applications, with a specific focus on power, industry, and agriculture.\n\nThe programme has so far been delivered in two streams:\n **Stream 1** sought to establish an AI for Decarbonisation's Virtual Centre of Excellence \n(ADViCE) to coordinate and engage with AI and decarbonisation stakeholders across relevant sectors in a fair and open way.\n\nSuccessful projects of Stream 2 featured a range of AI \napplications, including:\n The University of Nottingham's proposal to create an AI system that forecasts weather patterns to improve solar-powered grid management.\n\nScepticism towards new technologies is not new within the transport sector, as we have seen recently, for example, with the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles. Public concerns are often focused on the reliability and safety of new technologies, rather than any wider societal benefits that might be derived. It is likely that any future AI \ntechnology that involves controlling or operating moving vehicles will likely face the same concerns. \n\nTherefore, a clear evidence-based, unbiased approach \n\nIn Figures 3 and 4 we illustrate some of the potential positive gains that AI can bring to the transport sector, including some case studies where this is already being implemented, as well as covering the potential pitfalls of AI that might not be obvious at first glance.\n\nAmelia.AI by IPSoft **was used** by Enfield Council to work on frontline council services, taking resident queries, handling requests for permits and authenticating licences. \n\nAmelia handled over 2,300 queries in a 3 month period and was able to recognise the intent of user requests 98% of Thus, Amelia was able to absorb time-intensive routine requests while freeing up council employees to focus on more complex issues.\n\nThe volume of, and speed that, users' queries are analysed/ \nresponded to increases conditions and foresee various scenarios\n\nAI systems can be used to analyse visual satellite imagery to identify land use, carriageway separation, pedestrian crossing facilities, road curvature, junction classifications, speed limits and presence of vulnerable road users", "filename": "dataai.md"}

In 2021 DfT published its long-awaited Transport Decarbonisation Plan, which set out the government's commitments and the actions needed to decarbonise the entire transport system in the UK. Some of the key commitments in this plan were:\n **Increasing walking and cycling:**\n- Double cycling from 0.8 billion stages** in 2013 to 1.6 billion stages by 2025\n- Increase walking to 300 stages per person per year by 2025\n- Increase the percentage of children that usually walk to school, from 49% (2014) to 55% (2025) of children aged 5 to 10.\n\nCIHT responded to this consultation in 2023, highlighting that the proposed ZEV mandate would cause an increase in EVs on our roads, without ensuring there are sufficient public chargepoints to support them. CIHT \nrecommended that the mandate be revised to incentivise providing a minimum number of public chargepoints, in line with the projected minimum numbers of ZEVs for each year.\n\nIn this section we will explore how AI is already being used to decarbonise transport, as well as how it can be implemented soon, to achieve the strategic priorities in the Transport Decarbonisation Plan.\n\nDecarbonising transport will require a shift to cleaner, more sustainable, and active modes of transport. In the DfT 2020 Gear Change strategy for active travel, the UK government set a target for 50% of all journeys in towns and cities to be made by active travel modes by 2030. This target was reiterated in the Transport Decarbonisation Plan, which included a strategic priority of accelerating modal shift to public and active transport and an intention that *\"public transport and* active travel will be the natural first choice for our daily activities\".\n\nHowever, with the 2023 reductions in government investment for active travel infrastructure, the onus will be on local authorities and the private sector to be more creative and innovative in facilitating modal shift to public transport and active travel, and AI can potentially help to accelerate that transition.\n\nBelow is a selection of case studies gathered by the project team where AI is currently being used to process and analyse data such as traffic counts and road asset conditions, as well as images and videos, to provide more detailed insights into:\n\nThese case studies can be used to identify barriers to \n\nTable 1: Examples of current uses of AI to accelerate modal shift to public transport and active travel\n** A stage is defined as a change in the form of transport during a journey; for example, cycling to a railway station to catch the train and then walking to the office is three stages.\n\nStrategies to decarbonise road transport and the movement of goods include electrification, infrastructure development, last mile delivery, smart logistics, alternative fuels, and regulatory incentives to support the adoption of ZEVs and encourage sustainable transport practices.\n\nHowever, despite several UK government policies to help push towards ZEVs, such as the ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars in 2035, uptake is still slow for many reasons, including a lack of charging infrastructure and the high price tag that comes with purchasing a ZEV. It is therefore likely that the use of petrol and diesel vehicles will still be the prevalent form of car use well into the late 2030s.\n\nThe examples in Table 2 highlight how AI systems can be used to minimise the impact of petrol and diesel vehicle emissions, while also providing insights to improve infrastructure roll-out to support EV uptake.\n\nTo address net zero targets, there needs to be an increased focus on the whole-life carbon emissions of buildings and infrastructure, including embodied carbon emissions.8 As an industry, we therefore need to look at how we can deliver and maintain low-carbon infrastructure ", "filename": "dataai.md"}

Then, even when predictions are made, it is hard to know whether they will be fulfilled or if external factors will influence AI's success.\n\nUncertainty over the direction of new technologies can often halt uptake and innovation, with organisations \n(especially those in the public sector) hesitant to adopt these new technologies without confirmation of how and when they could be implemented.\n\nThe project team have proposed several current challenges they think could be solved using AI systems \n(outlined in Table 4), to provide the highways and transportation sector with food for thought on how AI \ntechnologies may develop in the future. AI will not be the answer to everything, and other technologies can also be used to solve some of these challenges. Most of all, we need human ingenuity to mould these technologies to our needs, to apply them so they enhance our decisions, while we remain cognisant of their limitations.\n\nTable 4: Examples gathered by the project group on the future uses of AI to address current challenges that will accelerate modal shift to public transport and active travel\n\nA recent report into AI in the transport and logistics sector found that there is currently a data skills shortage within our sector, with subsectors such as freight being particularly badly affected. This is driven by high competition for workers with expertise in both data and sectoral skillsets such as hardware production and manufacturing. The report noted that these shortages are also apparent in the regulatory space, where the lack of staff with technical expertise may be a further obstacle to developing effective governance. In 2021, the Office for AI published the findings of its research into the UK AI labour market, which found that:\n Half of surveyed firms' business plans had been impacted by a lack of suitable candidates with the appropriate AI knowledge and skills.\n\nWhen it comes to the transport sector, local authorities and national bodies are key to delivering, managing, and maintaining much of our infrastructure that enables the movement of people and goods. Because of this, it will be vital that any national advancements in technologies, such as AI, ensure that the capabilities of local authorities are not left behind. There are currently varying levels of technical skills across local authorities, which will dictate the pace at which AI is adopted, including skills in data governance, data management, data privacy, data engineering, and data science.\n\nOne of the first steps for local authorities will be to discover their current data landscape and to draw out the needs and requirements through use cases that can be prioritised and trialled.\n\nImplementing AI projects can be costly, and securing funding for research, development, and implementation can be a challenge, especially for smaller organisations and local authorities.\n\nLocal authorities are currently facing significant fiscal constraints: inflation and spiralling energy costs have impacted budgets considerably against remaining pressure to ensure the delivery of statutory services. Thus, many may well not have the financial and staffing resources to invest in the technology necessary to enable AI use within their organisations. \n\nLocal authorities will therefore need specific funding to invest in AI technologies, guidance to support the delivery of AI, and procurement advice to contract these technologies effectively.\n\nAs we have highlighted throughout this report, data is key to the success of AI to ensure accurate and unbiased outputs from AI systems.\n\nHowever, there are current challenges when it comes to using data for AI, such as:\n **Data gaps** - identifying what data has not been collected or is missing.\n\nOpen data standards can help the transportation industry (as well as other key industries in the UK) to overcome these challenges by defining what data we record and how we represent it.\n\nOpen data standards are documented, reusable agreements that help people and organisations to publish, access, share, and use betterquality **data.**11 It should be clear that open data standards are not the same as open data. Data can be configured to meet the agreement of rules of an open data standard but still be kept with an organisation's secure data environment.", "filename": "dataai.md"}
{"doc_id": 339, "text": "Where open data standards have been used, they allow those with access to the data to develop new ways of understanding and using it. Multiple different companies can then access open data to provide different solutions or insights. To give an example, the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is used by applications such as City Mapper for integrated transport views of cities.\n\nFigure 5 suggests areas that open data standards could apply to. Not all of these areas may need to be covered, but they should be considered when planning to use open data standards. \n\nA mix and match approach can be used, utilising different standards for each element rather than looking for one standard that covers all areas.\n\nFigure 5: Areas that open data standards could apply to.

Place of publication: The Open Data Institute. \n\nAvailable from: https://standards.theodi.org/ [Accessed 25/10/2023]\n\nOpen standards for data consist of many different types of agreement. \n\nMore complex standards are made up of smaller building blocks\n\nExamples of open data standards from outside the UK:\n\nAccelerating AI adoption in the highways and transport sector will require a combination of strategies and policies that promote innovation, collaboration, data sharing, and responsible AI development.\n\nIn March 2023, the UK government published and consulted on an AI regulation whitepaper, which sought to progress the AI capability of the UK by bringing clarity and coherence to the regulatory landscape.\n\nThe whitepaper put forward five cross-sector principles, to be issued on a non-statutory basis and implemented by existing sector regulators, that will ensure all existing and developing AI technologies are safe, fair, and reliable.\n\nIn response to the whitepaper, CIHT highlighted that these cross-sectoral principles were lacking in their consideration of the importance of data and how it is collected.\n\nBuilding on the work already set out in the National Data Strategy, CIHT believes we need to work towards regulations and standards that ensure that the data collected by the transport sector is:\n Fit for purpose, recorded in standardised formats on modern, secure, future-proof systems Held in a condition that means it is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, and accords with open data standards where possible.\n\nThe DfT has already made good progress in recognising the power of data through its Transport Data Strategy. However, when surveyed, most people who responded either roughly knew what the strategy was about or recognised the name but did not know what it was about* (only 7% said they had read it and would be confident to talk to peers about it). Clearly, more needs to be done to disseminate these messages from DfT to the transport sector. Next steps for DfT should also involve developing an AI \ntransport strategy that builds on the Transport Data Strategy by:\n Identifying areas where AI can have immediate impact and initiate pilot projects to demonstrate the feasibility of these solutions Promoting collaboration with other industries for the purpose of data sharing and developing an AI \necosystem Developing training programmes to equip the existing workforce with the necessary AI skills Publishing guidelines for ethical AI development and deployment within the transport sector.\n\nThe highways and transportation sector is at the early stages of its AI journey:\n We cannot predict with any certainty how AI will develop or in what direction it will go, making projections hard.\n\nAI can bring value to transport decarbonisation by:\n Accelerating modal shift to public transport and active travel. For example, this could be through the creation of reliable databases on sustainable transport use; optimising traffic flow in favour of active travel and public transport; and monitoring the condition of active travel infrastructure.\n\nFor example, by aiding in site selection of public EV \nchargepoints; managing grid capacity for EV charging; reducing congestion and improving traffic flow; and improving road safety to avoid traffic incidents.\n\nCIHT believes the highways and transportation sector must harness the power of data:\n There needs to be a greater consideration of not just the role data plays in supporting AI \ntechnologies but also how it can be used to enhance the experience of transport users. \n\nThis should be reflected in the AI regulations and standards published by the UK government.\n\nCIHT calls for more support for AI in public services:\n Local authorities and national bodies will be key to rolling out AI in public services such as transport, and so should be given appropriate funding, guidance, and procurement frameworks to do this successfully.\n\nCIHT believes the highways and transportation sector needs more awareness of AI:\n A clear evidence-based approach to policy developments is critical, particularly when it comes to public understanding around the adoption of new and emerging technologies within the transport sector. \n\nRegulators and organisations such as CIHT should work together to ensure that unbiased evidence on the pros and cons of AI is well communicated and shared widely. \n\nWorking across the sector to inform and educate people will build a healthy relationship between users and AI.", "filename": "dataai.md"}

Sectors are being disrupted, with new markets emerging, while others are converging, and some are disappearing entirely. The winners are likely to be those that can truly understand the impact and timing of disruption, and seize the right emerging opportunities. This means swiftly adapting business and operating models and securing the right partnerships and acquisition targets.\n\nThree cross-sector megatrends are fundamentally \n\nThe automotive, transport and wider mobility market is undergoing a transformational social, technological and economic shift, fundamentally changing the way people and products are moved. Many sectors, beyond automotive and transport, are being disrupted, with new markets emerging, existing ones converging, and others declining and possibly vanishing. New entrants and startups are challenging incumbents, who in turn look to leverage their experience and resources to build sustainable market positions. Amidst continued population growth, urbanisation and environmental concerns, new forms of mobility are critical to support tomorrow's population hubs and economic activity. Today's mobility systems suffer from congestion, inefficiency, accidents and high prices. But the future promises convenient, safe and economic mobility, with less impact to health and the environment. Mobility transformation is fuelled by three key technology-driven disruptive trends: electrification of vehicles (EVs) and alternative powertrains, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). Taken independently, each would significantly disrupt the ecosystem; but in combination, they should drive unprecedented change. These advances are set to replace our current vehicle-centric system with a radically more efficient, data-enabled and driverless ecosystem - with consumers at its heart. Users would be able to seamlessly transition between public, private, on-demand and scheduled modes of transport, with dynamic travel information enabling mid-journey changes. As the mobility ecosystem evolves, its global value is forecast to grow to more than US$1 trillion by 2030.1\n\nCooperative (\"KPMG International\"), a Swiss entity. All rights reserved.\n\nAt the same time, value will also shift and we expect to see different business models emerging. For example, with OEMs we see two dominant archetypes: 'Metalsmiths' manufacturing ever more sophisticated hardware (i.e. vehicles), alongside a new archetype, the 'Gridmaster'. The latter would manufacture vehicles, but also provide a platform for a variety of value-adding customer services. As with all disruptive change, we expect there to be clear winners and losers. However, the roll-out could vary significantly at both a country and city level depending on degree of urbanisation, household choice, existing options, infrastructure, and of course, local policies. Government support significantly influences all three disruptive trends. It also impacts the shape and pace of development of the new ecosystem.\n\nFrom a private sector perspective, we believe change will not be driven by any one company or sector. Instead it requires unprecedented collaboration, to develop the right mobility solutions. A fast-shifting ecosystem calls for swift decisions on changes to business and operating models, partnerships and acquisitions. In the following pages we look at the evolving mobility landscape in greater detail, considering each of the three technology-driven disruptive trends in terms of timing, impact and implications for market participants.\n\nBy the end of 2017, there were more than 3 million electric vehicles worldwide.2 Although this is less than 1 percent of the total parc, electrification is undoubtedly at the top of OEMs' agendas. With future bans announced for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles across much of the developed world, OEMs have little choice but to adapt. Volvo has pledged to manufacture only fully electric or hybrid models by 2019 and it is not alone; almost every major automaker has pledged significant investments in electric technology. Given these trends, OEMs are striving to win the battery technology race and secure access to essential raw materials.", "filename": "mobility-2030-transforming-the-mobility-landscape.md"}
{"doc_id": 342, "text": "From a consumer perspective, uptake has varied significantly by country, heavily affected by local policies. For example, the Norwegian government's generous subsidies meant that nearly 40 percent of new passenger vehicle sales were for either battery electric vehicles \n(BEVs) or plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) in 2017. Similarly, US and China have both offered strong financial incentives, and in combination now make up well over half of the current global EV parc.3 The UK has also made steady progress, with growth set to accelerate to 2030, by which time EVs could account for 69 percent of passenger car sales and 57 percent of light commercial vehicle (LCV) \nsales.4 In its strategy paper *The Road to Zero*5, the UK \ngovernment has reaffirmed its proposed 2040 ban on conventional cars, setting a clear direction and aligning itself with similar commitments in France, China, Norway and India, amongst others.\n\nScenarios for forecast UK LCV EV growth (% Sales)7\n\nCooperative (\"KPMG International\"), a Swiss entity. All rights reserved.\n\nThe UK government's environmental and health policies are arguably the biggest catalyst for consumers going electric. These include higher vehicle excise duty (VED) on diesel cars, continuation of the plug-in car grant and London's 'T-charge' (emissions surcharge) zone - all introduced in 2017. Such incentives will complement the roll-out of the supporting charging infrastructure, rising consumer awareness, and reductions in total cost of ownership (TCO), which is expected to achieve parity with ICE by 2021. And the economics for LCVs are even more compelling, thanks to fleet scale economies and high utilisation, which should bring TCO parity earlier than for passenger vehicles. The acute price and TCO sensitivity of LCV has the potential to make this sector a leader in EV adoption; however, a lack of sufficient viable models on the market means that adoption currently lags behind that of passenger vehicles. Heavier commercial vehicles, on the other hand, may take considerably longer to go electric, due to the large battery sizes required for long-distance haulage and the time taken to charge. Alternative fuels such as natural gas and hydrogen remain realistic alternatives. EV take-up may have gathered momentum, but requires a number of societal and behavioural changes to become truly widespread, with three key barriers remaining: 1. TCO: Achieving TCO parity with ICE vehicles will be critical for EV adoption. In the absence of further government incentives, we expect this to occur around 2020 for LCVs, with passenger vehicles to follow soon after, driven by a number of developments:\n- **Falling battery pack costs:** the cost of battery packs - which typically account for 40 percent of the cost of an entire EV - has declined by over 70 per cent8 in the past 7 years and is expected to further halve by 2030 due to technological developments (such as cell chemistry) and production scale economies.\n\nThe benefits case for EV adoption is clear: cleaner air, quieter streets, and a chance to meet global carbon emissions reduction targets to address climate change. Governments also see an opportunity to stake a leadership position for domestic industries in the emerging EV value chain. Overall, this is a promising start, but progress depends upon continued collaboration from the various ecosystem participants.\n\nExperimentation to date - now for coherent future mobility strategies.\n\nIn many markets, we see a clear shift in the way consumers view mobility, not least in their views towards vehicle ownership. This trend is particularly pronounced within urban areas, where people have greater mobility choice. In KPMG's *Global Automotive Executive Survey 2019*, the opinion of decreasing ownership of vehicles is also shared by 39% of surveyed consumers, which shows that half of car owners know today that they will no longer want to own a personal vehicle by 2025.11 Similarly, UK Department for Transport figures show the percentage of men in England aged 17-20 holding a full UK driver's license falling from 51 percent in the mid-1990s to just 29 percent in 2017 (and from 81 percent to 69 percent for men aged 21-29).12 These shifts can be partly attributed to the demand for consumer mobility 'as a service' as an alternative to ownership. Most notably through the emergence of on-demand private car hire firms such as Uber and Lyft, which have rapidly become commonplace in cities worldwide. Mobility-as-a-Service is an evolving concept of how consumers and businesses move away from vehicle ownership towards service-based transport. In this sense, MaaS includes multi-modal aggregation of transport modes as well as on-demand mobility. In the overall landscape of mobility we highlight four areas where organisations are innovating to create new business and service models.", "filename": "mobility-2030-transforming-the-mobility-landscape.md"}
{"doc_id": 343, "text": "There are many examples around the world where customers can travel on different modes of transport (from different providers) \nvia one payment platform.\n\nAlthough such services are typically restricted to public transport, new, integrated private/public versions are emerging. MaaS Global operates a MaaS platform in Helsinki, Finland, and is also trialling a scheme in other countries including the UK. The company has developed a travel product called Whim with a monthly subscription. Customers can plan and pay for individual journeys via train, bus, taxi, car-rental and bike-share on a single app, or purchase an 'all-in' subscription covering all their transport needs in the city for a fixed price.\n\nAnd Helsinki is not alone. Denver, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Singapore, Barcelona, Hanover, Vienna, Montpelier, Gothenburg, Paris and Eindhoven have all piloted some kind of MaaS solution at the time of writing. Despite these exciting developments, public authorities still struggle to balance the user experience offered by MaaS, with policy objectives of economic growth, social inclusion, space optimisation, environmental benefit, and citizen health and wellbeing. There is also a huge opportunity for MaaS to replace company cars, although this will require significant shifts in tax policy. *KPMG's MaaS Requirements Index*13 enables operators and authorities to understand the optimum level of regulation and policy needed to achieve their objectives, while balancing the commercial needs of operators.\n\nOver the past year, we have seen innovation in new car subscription services. Traditional personal contracts or long-term leasing arrangements are being replaced by more flexible monthly contracts bundling insurance, maintenance and other costs within an all-inclusive price, accessed online. With consumers increasingly tempted to forgo personal vehicle ownership for more flexible access, subscription services could be a 'middle ground' for those who still want fulltime access to a vehicle and flexibility to change models or \n'pause' their usage. OEMs and independent platforms are both introducing new subscription schemes, and testing out new business and operating models. Importantly for OEMs, these schemes represent an opportunity to maintain relationships with customers and wrest back control from on-demand platform providers.\n\nDemand-responsive, private hire car providers are growing in popularity. They offer customer connectivity, account-based payments, intelligent routing algorithms and a large pool of drivers (often prepared to work in the so-called 'gigeconomy'), and can be paid for in arrears and on account. \n\nThe most prominent example is Uber, introduced to the UK in 2012, which recorded over 20 million journeys in its first 4 years.14 By early 2017, half of the UK population had access to Uber services. However, ride-hailing is not the only on-demand model. We have seen sustained interest in car-sharing schemes, such as BMW's DriveNow. Another innovation is dynamic shuttle services, also known as demand responsive transit (like ViaVan) that combine elements of mass transit with dynamic routing. Penetration of such services is only expected to grow further with the advent of autonomous vehicles (AV), with an associated pronounced decline in vehicle ownership, particularly in urban areas. Roughly half the cost of ondemand private hire vehicles relates to the driver and as a result, we estimate that AV MaaS provision could be up to 40 percent cheaper than private vehicle ownership by 2030.15\n\nCost per mile - UK modes16\n\nWhile passenger transport is often the focus when considering the benefits of mobility, commercial vehicles and logistics should not be forgotten, given the significant economic and sustainability impact. There is widespread innovation in business models - with the rise of peer-to-peer logistics platforms and consignment sharing - as well as new modes like drone delivery (as tested by several large technology players). While alternative fuels, connectivity and automation should eventually impact most of the supply chain, we expect an initial focus on lower emissions for heavier vehicles and innovations in last-mile deliveries.\n\nCompanies such as Starship Technologies - with autonomous robotic delivery pods - are shaking up the future urban logistics landscape. We shall address each of these topics in more detail in a forthcoming series of articles on the commercial vehicle market. In these four focus areas, we expect to see increasing innovation and experimentation in new business models, which should attract venture capital and investment. However, we believe true step-change will come as mobility services are coupled with driverless technology (discussed in the following section) that enables an integrated and automated transport ecosystem.", "filename": "mobility-2030-transforming-the-mobility-landscape.md"}
{"doc_id": 344, "text": "CAV offers an opportunity to transform the world by fundamentally altering the way people and goods are moved. It could improve safety and congestion, while opening up independent mobility to excluded people such as younger or older travellers. It could also increase productivity, bring a new travel experience, change the roles of future employees and free up valuable urban land like parking lots. Momentum towards highly automated (Level 4) CAVs continues apace. At least 15 OEMs have pledged to release Level 4 AVs between 2019-202517,with much of the early deployment expected to be in urban areas. Alphabet subsidiary Waymo has already formally launched its commercial self-driving car service in Arizona.18 Level 5 autonomy - full autonomy in all locations and conditions - may not arrive before 2030. Even this may be an unrealistic target, with the market instead launching iterations of Level 4 autonomy, gradually expanding the areas where such vehicles can travel. Although the onset of CAV should decrease the overall number of vehicles, the number of journeys and total distance travelled is likely to increase. Initial projections for the UK suggest that total passenger miles travelled could rise by as much as 10 percent between 2015 and 2030.19 This will be driven by more affordable on-demand mobility services, as well as greater access to groups currently excluded (e.g. the young and elderly). These vehicles will increasingly be owned by fleets and, like taxis, will be heavily utilised assets. This is in stark contrast to the average passenger car, which currently stands idle 95 percent of the time.20 With less need to own a vehicle, we expect a pronounced decline in car sales by 2030.\n\nScenario for forecast UK AV (L4/5) growth in new car and LCV sales\n\nBut the speed of adoption is likely to vary significantly by region, based on four key pillars underlying AV adoption: availability of infrastructure, AV technology research & development (R&D), public acceptance of the technology, and the regulatory environment. These factors are considered in detail within KPMG's *AV Readiness Index*.\n\nThe emergence of CAV, supported by new technologies and a maturing digital and physical infrastructure, will create an explosion in new value opportunities. \n\nAs increasingly connected cars evolve to become \"computers on wheels\", they will generate more data than ever before, which can benefit consumers by increasing the safety, convenience and enjoyment of journeys. Maintenance can go from being reactive to predictive, new parts can be ordered automatically and whole fleets can be dynamically managed. In addition, over-the-air software updates can improve vehicle performance without anyone even coming into contact with the vehicle. From a passenger experience perspective, connectivity should significantly broaden the scope of in-vehicle entertainment, commerce, health and working opportunities. CAV should also enhance road management, enabling transport authorities to manage capacity on busy routes, using CAV communications infrastructure to keep traffic flowing and reduce congestion. But this scale and breadth of connectivity also has implications for cyber security22, which is likely to be a major issue area to be addressed through to 2030.\n\nFrom disconnected verticals to an interdependent ecosystem.\n\nHistorically, the transportation industry has operated along largely linear value chains. This is all changing. Various sectors are converging, eager to seize revenue opportunities in a new mobility ecosystem. The result is a complex web of interconnected value chains. \n\nWe expect a multitude of new entrants to take a share of this new market, with unprecedented levels of partnership and collaboration in the search for new solutions.\n\nAt the same time, sources of value will fundamentally shift both within value chains and across the ecosystem. \n\nThe value derived from today's personal car is fairly equally split between upstream (raw materials to finished vehicles) and downstream (all other parts of the value chain). Customers typically directly buy services such as fueling, insurance and service, maintenance and repair. Downstream revenues associated with personally owned vehicles are estimated at US$45,000 over a car's lifetime.23 But, by 2030, in an EV-CAV-MaaS world, we believe the downstream value could be as much as ten times larger, driven by new, digitally-enabled revenue streams. Having enjoyed years of strong, steady revenues and a good share of the value chain, incumbents and perhaps even entire sectors may be completely eliminated, whilst opportunities for new services (and new entrants) will emerge. The impact is likely to be far-reaching:\n\nThe decline in ICE vehicle sales, and the \n\nWe expect the market to divide into two \n\nA decline in hydrocarbon fuel sales \n\nHuge changes are expected in a sector \n\nAside from the immediate requirement for ", "filename": "mobility-2030-transforming-the-mobility-landscape.md"}
{"doc_id": 345, "text": "EV charging points, the typically slowerpaced infrastructure market should be impacted in a number of ways. Private infrastructure players, such as parking lots, need to manage potentially rapid changes in driving behaviour, as AVs collect and drop off passengers (or re-charge) rather than park. This could regenerate urban landscapes, as prime real-estate gets used for last-mile delivery, charging and SMR hubs, data centers, entertainment or leisure. Local transport authorities should evolve, to manage not just physical infrastructure but also data exchanges, integration and maintenance of transport services. 'Smart' traffic management may become increasingly important, as AVenabled mobility increases the total miles travelled.\n\nWith drivers freed from the shackles of \n\nData - the key foundation of future mobility \n\nAlthough the above is not an exhaustive list, it is clear that disruption is likely to reverberate across a multitude of sectors, providing huge opportunities, risks and even existential threats.\n\nDecisions made now are likely to determine the future for many companies, with some positioned for success, and others facing a fight for survival.\n\nAs incumbents, new entrants and startups compete for a share of the mobility market, each should consider where to play and how to win. Companies only have a small window of opportunity to get ahead and position themselves to shape the future ecosystem. This means being a fast mover, by securing beneficial partnerships, acquisition targets and structuring internal financial, business and operating models. In this disruptive context, organisational leaders may well feel overwhelmed and uncertain of the steps they need to take.\n\nAnd while the shape of the future mobility ecosystem remains unclear, it is already in the process of transformation. Through our extensive work with existing and new mobility players, we observe a consistent set of disruptive themes. The following framework is designed to help players develop appropriate strategies to overcome these challenges.\n\nPotential winning strategies\n\nThe first challenge for many businesses is to understand the nature of disruption: the likelihood, and scale and timing of potential impacts. In some cases, uncertainty and lack of tangible, proven options may cause 'action paralysis', as organisations wait for others to make the first move. In other cases, a few enlightened individuals may struggle to convey a sense of urgency across their organisations. Whilst these delays may represent a significant risk, there are ways to accelerate change. Organisations could distill the key leading indicator(s) of disruption (for instance, for a fuel forecourt business this may be national EV adoption rates), and monitor for when corrective action needs to be taken. This may take the form of a 'playbook', with clearly defined trigger points and associated actions. A more proactive approach (seen in the rise of corporate venture capital in the mobility sector) is to devote resources to small-scale pilots or ventures, to test new ideas and provide potential platforms for future growth. \n\nNew governance may be needed to enable a swift reaction to market changes.\n\nWith emerging value chains, breakdown of sector boundaries and the rise of aggregator business models, there should be increasing competition for consumer ownership. At the same time, shifts in consumer preferences are placing further pressures on incumbents, who may not have the agility to quickly launch new products, due to the legacy of older manufacturing plants and IT systems. For instance, as consumers move away from personal vehicle ownership towards on-demand mobility services, their direct relationship may shift from the car brand to a vehicle-agnostic platform such as Uber or Lyft. At the same time, technology giants loom large over the sector; these players have both the brand and the customer journey to significantly disrupt the industry. In response, some players are creating joint propositions across different parts of the value chain to improve customer convenience and capture share. Examples include the bundling of insurance and servicing into a flexible vehicle subscription, or combining home energy with roaming EV charging. In both cases, the ability to develop cross-sector partnerships and alliances quickly is key to securing capabilities, suppliers and channels. Highly specialised companies could also aim to dominate non-customer facing segments of new value chains. However, they should be wary of becoming commoditised, and work with future customer 'owners' to ensure they deliver real value.\n\nMany players view the evolving mobility landscape through the lens of their existing assets. They need to 'un-strand' these assets and position themselves to access emerging opportunities. Consider a parking lot in a city center. In a world of AV taxis, vehicles may no longer require long and expensive stays. Instead robo-taxis, powered by algorithms, will either be constantly on the move or stored in out-of-town depots. But this opens up opportunities to re-use the land - perhaps as a logistics hub for last-mile urban AV deliveries. Far-sighted owners may even have put in place the legal and physical infrastructure to quickly execute such a change. And they may also have realised the benefit of bringing in a partner to provide complementary capabilities, bringing competitive advantage and increasing speed to market.", "filename": "mobility-2030-transforming-the-mobility-landscape.md"}
{"doc_id": 346, "text": "Given its immense potential value, data is often referred to as 'the new oil'. In future, more data will be captured than ever before, through connectivity, sensor technology and the needs of AV, with consumers increasingly willing to share personal information in exchange for an appropriate return. Making best use of and monetising this data is likely to drive two trends:\n\nOnce the nature of the potential disruption is understood, and an appropriate response designed, the next step is to scale the new proposition. This may involve rolling out a successful pilot of a new mobility business model (e.g. MaaS aggregator platform), or developing a leading-edge technology (e.g. solid state battery). In the new mobility landscape, the ability to scale and commercialise quicker than your competitors could be critical; platform models, data-driven AI, manufacturing supply chains and brands all benefit from scale economies. Organisations should therefore consider how they grow across multiple markets and segments, and how their supporting operating model is structured. Financing growth is another important issue; funds will need to be diverted from other projects, sourced from the market, or spread across partnerships or other innovative mechanisms. A successful strategy calls for alignment of financial, business and operating models - something that can be often neglected.\n\nCollaborate or commiserate: Working together to build a \n\nAppendix 1\n\nMobility 2030 - simply defined - is about understanding how people and goods will move in the future.

Numerous collaborative events have been held as part of the initiative, to work through critical themes, identify opportunities and risks, stimulate new partnerships and collaboration, and jointly shape the evolution of mobility. Collectively, our vision is a cleaner, safer, more efficient and more economic transport system that will underpin future societies and markets. In parallel - and through our mobility hubs across the globe - we have employed our insight, experience and reach to support clients from across sectors to better understand the future mobility ecosystem and the implications for their financial, business and operating models.

{"doc_id": 349, "text": "Carsharing refers to a model of vehicle sharing where users access cars on an as-needed basis, and often pay by time of reservation or miles driven. As of January 2015, there were 23 carsharing operators in the U.S. amounting to over 1.1 million members and over 16,000 vehicles.[19] **As of**\nJanuary 2017, there were 39 carsharing organizations in North America serving 1.9 million members with a collective fleet of 24,629 vehicles. (these numbers do not include P2P carsharing; they include roundtrip and one-way carsharing operations.).**[20]**\n\nRoundtrip carsharing is one of the earliest carsharing models, granting members access to a shared vehicle fleet. As the name suggests, roundtrip carsharing requires users to return to the same location where they accessed the vehicle. One of the largest North American-based roundtrip carsharing operators is Zipcar, which operates more than 12,000 vehicles in urban areas on college campuses and at airports across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Belgium, Turkey and Taiwan.[21] There have been **numerous studies that document behavioral changes associated with**\nroundtrip carsharing programs. A 2004 study on City CarShare **in San Francisco, CA found that nearly** 30% of members reduced car ownership by one of more cars; two-thirds of members reported that they opted not to purchase an additional vehicle.[22] **This reduced car ownership typically translates**\ninto reduced driving, and thus lowered energy consumption **and greenhouse gas emissions.**\n[3]\nCarsharing programs also affect usage patterns of other travel modes. A 2011 study by UC Berkeley researchers found that roundtrip carsharing has a mixed impact on public transit and non-motorized modal use, with the same proportion of respondents increasing and decreasing usage of these modes.\n\nOne-way carsharing varies from roundtrip carsharing in that it grants **members more flexibility in** pickup and dropoff location. In one-way carsharing—also known as point-to-point carsharingmembers can access a vehicle at one location and end their trip in another location.[1] **As of September**\n2015, companies that offered one-way functionality in the U.S. include car2go, GIG, ReachNow, Zipcar, and BlueIndy.\n\nPersonal vehicle sharing (PVS) is a carsharing service model that allows short-term access to privately owned vehicles. P2P carsharing, a subset **of PVS, employs privately owned vehicles made available for** shared usage by members of a P2P member base. P2P carsharing companies differ from other carsharing operators in that users provide the free-floating vehicle fleet using their personally owned vehicles. P2P carsharing operators in North America include Getaround and Turo **(formerly**\nRelayRides), and as of May 2015, there were eight active P2P operators in North America.[1] **One 2014**\nstudy found that the top three reasons for using P2P carsharing are convenience and availability, monetary savings, and expanded mobility options.[26] **Another study documented that personal**\nvehicle sharing services can expand the geographic range of vehicle sharing services by renting underused autos and therefore lowering vehicle usage requirements. However, fear of sharing personal assets was cited as one of the primary barriers to the adoption of P2P sharing services.**[27]**", "filename": "Shared transport - Wikipedia.md"}
{"doc_id": 350, "text": "Ridesharing services enable shared rides between drivers and passengers that have similar origins and destination pairings. Ridesharing includes both vanpooling **and carpooling. Vanpooling involves a** grouping of between seven and 15 people traveling in a van, and carpooling refers to groups of less than seven people traveling together in one vehicle.[1] **Ridesharing is distinct from ridesourcing (or**\nTNCs), like Uber and Lyft in **that the driver typically decides trip origin, destination, and any** deviations to accommodate one or more additional passengers. Drivers and riders have the same origin, destination, or potentially share multiple proximate destinations, with a common purpose of conserving resources, saving money, or saving time.[28] Driver earnings from ridesharing are regulated in the U.S. by the Internal Revenue Service, and as of January 2017, they were capped at 53.5 cents per mile for business travel by car.[29] Both **technology-enabled ridesharing organizations**\nand more informal ridesharing programs exist. Examples of technology-enabled ridesharing companies are BlaBlaCar, Carma Carpool, Scoop, and Waze Carpool. These services usually require participants to join either through a membership, website, or mobile application. Potential drivers and 4/13 2:57 PM   - \nriders can **then post driving routes or preferred travel routes and the ridesharing service will connect** riders with passengers that share similar origin destination pairings. More informal ad hoc ridesharing programs include slugging **(also known as casual carpooling). Casual carpooling is an** informal form of commuter ridesharing operating in Washington, D.C.; Houston, Texas; and San Francisco, California.[30] **Casual carpooling has been in existence for over 30 years, is entirely run**\ninformally by its users, and does not use a mobile application or information communication technology. In one study in the San **Francisco Bay Area in 2014, researchers interviewed, observed,** and surveyed participants at multiple casual carpooling locations. The study found that motivations for casual carpooling participation include: convenience, time savings, and monetary savings, while environmental and community-based motivations ranked low. Casual carpooling is an efficient transportation option for these commuters, while environmental sustainability **benefits are a positive** byproduct. Seventy-five percent of casual carpool users were previously public transit riders, and over 10% formerly drove alone.[31] In the U.S., the modal share **of ridesharing has declined since the 1970s.**\nIn 1970, The U.S. Census found that about 20% of American workers commuted to work by carpool. The American Community Survey has found that the carpooling modal share has declined to around nine percent as of 2013, though it still remains the second most popular mode of travel in the U.S.,\nnext to driving alone.**[32]**\n\nOn-demand ride services include ridehailing, ridesplitting, and E-hail for taxis. They are services that provide rides on-demand, usually in passenger cars, for a fee.\n\nThese companies have faced criticism for adversely impacting traffic congestion,[34][35][36][37]the environment, and public safety. A study of ridehailing users in San Francisco in 2014 evaluated modal shifts due to ridehailing and found that, if ridehailing were unavailable, 39% of respondents would have taken a taxi and 33% would have used a form of public transit. Four percent entered a public transit station as their origin or destination, suggesting ridehailing may serve as a first-/last-mile trip to or from public transit in some cases.[38] **Another study of ridehailing users in Denver and Boulder,**\nColorado found that a third of respondents would have taken public transit, biked, or walked instead 2:57 PM   - \nof using a ridehailing service. Another third would have driven in a personal vehicle, and 12% would not have made the trip.[39][40] **These city-specific differences suggest that travel behavior impacts due**\nto these services could be dependent on location. Only New York City and San Francisco have studied the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) implications of ridehailing services. Both studies found that Uber and Lyft are increasing VMT, with the heaviest impacts seen in some of the busiest areas of each city.\n\nHowever, both of these studies do not take into consideration modal shift changes.**[41][42]**", "filename": "Shared transport - Wikipedia.md"}
{"doc_id": 351, "text": "Ridesplitting involves splitting both a ride and fare in a vehicle with others traveling in the same general direction.[43] **These services allow dynamic matching and route variation in real time as**\npassengers request pickups. [44] **The user cost of ridesplitting services is lower than the cost of regular**\nridesourcing services, since the riders are sharing one ride and splitting the associated costs. Yet, ridesplitting may lead to detour and inconvenience effects for the users. [45] **Ridesplitting services are**\ngenerally only available as an option in cities with denser and more established ridesourcing markets.\n\nRidesplitting is even less studied than ridesourcing, and therefore travel behavior impacts are not yet well understood.\n\nE-Hail services are a mode of transportation **by which taxis can be reserved via Internet or mobile**\nphone applications maintained by either a third-party provider or the taxi company.[1] Examples of eHail services include Curb, Flywheel, Arro, Hailo, and **iTaxi. In response to competition from**\nridesourcing companies, e-Hail taxi services have experienced rapid growth. As of October 2014, 80%\nof San Francisco taxis reported using Flywheel, an e-Hail app.[7] **As of February 2015, Flywheel was** active in six cities, and Curb was active in about 60 U.S. cities.[1] **Since they use taxis, e-Hail services**\ncharge local taxi rates and do not use demand-based pricing during periods of higher ride demand, as ridesourcing services often do.\n\nMicrotransit is a technology-enabled private transit service that often uses shuttles or vans and is characterized by flexible scheduling, flexible routing, or both. Current microtransit operators include Chariot (acquired by Ford in September 2016) and Via. Defunct operators include Bridj and Leap Transit. Two forms of microtransit have emerged, including fixed-route with fixed-schedule services and flexible-route with on-demand scheduling. Chariot, which started in San Francisco and now operates in Austin, New York, and Seattle, functions similarly to public transit and runs 15-seater vans along pre-determined routes. Chariot determines new routes by \"crowdsourcing\" potential customer demand and then launching a new route once enough demand is indicated. Via **is an example of** flexible route, on-demand microtransit and currently operates in New York City, Washington DC, and Chicago. In New York City, users request a ride using Via's app and a shared van will pick them up with other travelers heading in a similar direction. The service is dynamic, without static routes, and shifts routes based on expected traffic and rider demand. Via charges a fare of $5 to $7 per ride in New York City, depending on the method of booking.[46] **Both Chariot and Via conform to the IRS**\n\"transit pass\" standard, allowing them to qualify for pre-tax commuter benefits.\n\nCourier Network Services (CNS) provide delivery services of packages, food, and other items for compensation using their own transportation and are connected with shippers and customers through an online **app or platform. In P2P delivery services, someone who signs up and is approved by the** platform can use their own vehicle or bicycle to conduct a delivery. There are many business models within P2P delivery services. Postmates **couriers make deliveries using their own bicycles, scooters, or** cars. They charge a delivery fee plus a service charge of nine percent of **the value of the goods being** delivered. Instacart **delivers groceries for a $4 to $10 fee, depending on how long the delivery takes to** complete. The proliferation of these services, where couriers use their personally owned vehicles or bicycles, could reduce the need for delivery companies to maintain and own their own delivery fleet.[1]\nSome CNS models that have emerged also incorporate on-demand ride services (e.g., TNCs) that deliver packages. CNS deliveries are either made in separate trips or in multiple-purpose trips that may also serve passengers simultaneously.

Scootersharing companies took inspiration from the fourth generation bikesharing strategy, but replaced bicycles with GPS-tracked electric scooters. These scooters are also \"dockless\", and are dropped off and picked up from any location within an urban area.**[48]**\nDue to the lower speed of scooters and their electric assistance, it is easier for commuters to use them and for companies to invest in a fleet of them. Many scootersharing companies have been founded in the past few years. This includes Bird, Lime, Bolt, Skip, Scoot Networks, and Spin. Because of its growing popularity, some cities have also looked to ban certain scootersharing companies, taking **on similar strategies to ridesharing bans. In San Francisco, the city created a** Powered Scooter Share Permit Program that limits the number of companies that could operate scooters, and the amount of scooters. Cities that enforced similar regulations cite how scooters are more commonly ridden on sidewalks instead of bike lanes and could injure pedestrians. Other reasons would also be the lack of these companies enforcing riders to wear safety gear such as helmets.\n\nSmartphones represent one of the most important transportation innovations of the 21st century. A variety of **factors are changing the way people think about mobility including: demographic shifts,** advancements in geo-spatial routing and computing power, the use of cloud technologies, faster wireless networks capable of carrying greater bandwidth, congestion, and heightened awareness about the environment and climate change.

Da Vinci 32, 20133 Milan, Italy creation and a spread of consumer knowledge toward\n\nKeywords Analytical hierarchy process -\nConsumer attitudes assessment - Electric vehicles -\nFlexibility - Survey - Sustainable mobility\n\nSustainability is a major challenge of today's society, as it involves defining a new paradigm that aims to put stakeholder engagement at the center of the agenda (D'Adamo, 2022). In this framework, flexibility has always been described as an opportunity rather than a threat. In fact, the literature places increasing emphasis on the management of flexible systems (Sushil & Dinesh, 2022). The goal is identifying suitable methodologies to evaluate flexible initiatives (Sushil, 2018), and this choice needs to consider sustainability issues (Singh et al., 2021). Indeed, this topic is crucial to the development of civil society. For this reason after a brief description of the concept of flexibility, the paper proceeds to describe the European framework geared toward promoting sustainability. The focus, then, turns to the topic of this work, which is the existing relationship between sustainable mobility and electric vehicles\n(EVs), also evaluating consumer research.\n\nThe issue of supply chain flexibility is a strategic theme geared toward reducing unwanted supply chain uncertainty (Stevenson & Spring, 2007). Specifically, flexibility is the ability of a business to respond quickly and affordably to changes in the environment, technology, organization and strategy. As a result, it consists of initiatives aimed at improving efficiency and organizational performance (Shukla et al., 2019; Sushil, 2015). However, an inadequate communication among stakeholders in the value chain can lead to distortions (Dwivedi et al., 2021). Hence, stakeholders' engagement can contribute to the formation of ecosystems combining sustainability and digitization\n(Sassanelli & Terzi, 2022), as digitalization is changing business models of industries (Lamperti et al., 2023).\n\nIn addition, the framework in which a business operates is extremely complex due to dynamic and unpredictable aspects. In this regard, risk management should be related to the economic dimension and cost control (Settembre-Blundo et al., 2021). Within this framework, different regulatory systems in several countries can lead to further market distortions. On the one hand, there is an aim to reconcile climate policy flexibility mechanisms toward the inclusion of developing countries (Atici, 2022); on the other hand, some analyses show that EU emissions Trading System (EU ETS) does not cause carbon leakage (Naegele & Zaklan, 2019; Verde, 2020). However, Europe has established a defense mechanism called the carbon border adjustment mechanism (European Commission, 2023).\n\nOther analyses propose the introduction of a flexible consumption tax (Gerbeti, 2021).", "filename": "s40171-023-00349-w.md"}
{"doc_id": 354, "text": "The energy sector is also characterized by flexibility\n(Zahedi et al., 2022), and the mobility sector in particular is seeing the development of EVs, which are geared to have a reduced environmental impact compared to internal combustion vehicles. However, their impact on urban power systems needs to be well-studied (Vilathgamuwa et al.,\n2022). The literature pays attention to its deployment in Europe (Lanz et al., 2022; Razmjoo et al., 2022). Therefore, more details about the European framework should be provided.\n\nThe growth of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the transport sector saw continuous growth from 2013 to 2019 in Europe reaching 835 million tons of CO2 equivalent\n(compared to 673 MtCO2eq in 1990). The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a deceleration in 2020 (727 MtCO2eq), but 2021 estimates show a rising trend again (777 MtCO2eq) (European Environment Agency, 2022). The transport sector is responsible for about 25% of Europe's GHG emissions, so its reduction is necessary to achieve the European Green Deal. That is, Europe has a goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. However, this sector contributes 5% of gross domestic product and employs about 10 million people (European Commission, 2021).\n\nEuropean Environment Agency reports that ''transport is a vital sector but our current mobility system is simply not sustainable'' (European Environment Agency, 2023). Starting in 2035, the European Union decided that all new cars sold in the market must be zero-emission vehicles. The current European context is characterized by a strong debate on the future of sustainable mobility. Some countries prefer to focus on e-fuels, others on biofuels and others on electrification. In this way, we understood the relevance of the issue, also emphasized in the literature\n(Tsakalidis et al., 2020; Wolf et al., 2021), and the need therefore to provide new assessments on the issue of sustainability.\n\nThe automotive chain can be improved through cost efficiency (Jasin´ski et al., 2021), measuring the impact of dynamic models (Rosa & Terzi, 2018) and strategic alliances (Rajan et al., 2023), but also directing its choices toward flexibility concepts (Solke et al., 2022). Sustainable mobility is the achievement of an overall volume of physical mobility meeting basic needs through appropriate technologies limiting GHG emissions in order not to alter ecosystem integrity (Banister, 2008; Bardal et al., 2020).\n\nElectric mobility is emerging to minimize environmental impacts. However, there are many challenges to be faced (Onat et al., 2021). Indeed, the use of green sources is required as much in the production phase as in the use one\n(Shafique & Luo, 2022) including the use of energy storage systems (Gupta & Shankar, 2022). The environmental impact battery should be investigated considering its impacts (Xia & Li, 2022), and a significant amount of components and raw materials are required (Baars et al.,\n2021), in particular lithium (Sun et al., 2022). Here, the attention should be paid to their end-of-life management\n(D'Adamo & Rosa, 2019), by encouraging circular solutions along the entire supply chain (Taddei et al., 2022) and providing benefits and opportunities (Molla et al., 2023).\n\nInteresting results are modular EV platforms (Lampo´n, 2022) and innovation in electric mobility ecosystems\n(Arribas-Ibar et al., 2021). The green transition in electric mobility requires the use of renewable energy, local industrial development of the sector and battery recycling\n(D'Adamo et al., 2023). Furthermore, large-scale EV\nadoption will not hinder the automotive industry's longterm development (Guo et al., 2022), and the life cycle of batteries also requires in-depth analysis (Schulz-Mo¨nninghoff & Evans, 2023).\n\nConsumer analyses on EV issues show contradictory views also stemming from the difficult balance between energy transition and mining impacts resulting from the complex supply chain of EVs (Liu et al., 2022). Purchase cost is the most influential factor in the purchase of EVs (D'Adamo et al., 2023). In addition to purchase price, availability of the required charging infrastructure and charger subsidies are believed to be the enabling factors for EV adoption\n(Almansour, 2022). In this way, government subsidies at the purchase stage are decisive, and some analyses try to quantify the value demanded by consumers (Dong, 2022).", "filename": "s40171-023-00349-w.md"}
{"doc_id": 355, "text": "In addition, other authors highlight to better evaluate how tax incentives might lead the consumer to purchase such vehicles (Secinaro et al., 2022).\n\nHowever, purchase choices also involve other perspectives. In fact, while knowledge of EVs is considered the most relevant cognitive measure (Jaiswal et al., 2022),\nstudies should more include some factors such as individuals' environmental concerns and green trust facilities\n(Yeg˘in & Ikram, 2022). In addition, consumer preferences vary by purchasing group: private buyers of EVs are more interested in high-density charging facilities, while cab drivers are more interested in high range (Xiong et al., 2023). Regarding autonomy, a very useful application could be battery swap technology. Its adoption is positively influenced by attitude, knowledge, perceived usefulness and subjective norm (Adu-Gyamfi et al., 2022). Consumers' perception about the ecological attributes of EVs seems to be vague, and therefore they are unwilling to pay more for such products (Shi et al., 2023). In addition, an awareness campaign on the EV segment should also be evaluated (Bryła et al., 2023). Renting an EV can help people get past consumer confidence and affordability. In addition price value does indirectly impact through the mediating effect of willingness to pay (WTP) the rental intention of young consumers (Gulzari et al., 2022).\n\nThis work builds on the approach proposed by D'Adamo et al. (2023), in which the factors influencing the purchase of an EV and the factors driving electric mobility toward the green transition were examined. A different methodological approach (analytic hierarchy process (AHP) vs.\n\nLikert scale) is provided using academic experts, and also given the increased focus on consumers, it is necessary to conduct an online survey on EVs to identify consumer choices in Italy. Consequently, this work aims to focus on sustainability challenges in electric mobility, by identifying whether a flexible strategy can support the decarbonization of the transportation sector. The following research questions (RQs) will be investigated:\nRQ1. Which factors influence the purchase of an electric vehicle?\n\nRQ2. Which factors are driving electric mobility toward a green transition? RQ3. Which are the consumer behaviors toward electric vehicles?\n\nThe methodology used in this work consists of a hybrid model composed of the AHP and the online survey.\n\nAHP is a multi-criteria decision support technique. Its approach is widely used to evaluate choices in the areas of sustainability and flexibility (Jain & Raj, 2013; Mangla et al., 2015). This method aims at identifying the relevance of specific criteria and could be used to compare different alternatives. The output of AHP is a priority level assigned to each criterion based on a nine-point rating scale, and it is based on pairwise comparison (Saaty, 2008). The most important criteria are given the highest weight, and all weights are normalized for comparison. AHP can capture the subjective as well as the objective view of problems, and measuring the consistency of the decision reduces the bias against the decision (Kumar & Pant, 2023). However, other multi-criteria methods are also suitable for decision making, but AHP has the advantage in which factor weights are assigned in an easy way and is very appropriate for sustainable mobility (Alex et al., 2022).\n\nWithin this work, AHP is used to answer the RQ1 and RQ2. AHP allows to measure the reliability of assessments, by calculating a consistency ratio (CR). The maximum value of CR can be 0.10 and is calculated as the ratio of consistency index (CI) to random inconsistency (RI).\n\nAHP consists of the following steps: (i) objectives' identification; (ii) experts' identification; (iii) criteria selection; (iv) weights assignment; and (v) weights aggregation.\n\nThe objectives of the analysis are RQ1 and RQ2, respectively. These are the same topics analyzed in a previous step of the research (D'Adamo et al., 2023). However, in addition to changing the expert panel, we chose to use AHP. The 10-point value is an excellent method, but we opted for the AHP for two reasons: (i) to conduct an analysis not at the level of a single variable, but in pairs, and (ii) to have a consistency index on the ratings provided by the experts. Similar choices are also seen in other studies (Jin et al., 2022; Leung & Mo, 2019).", "filename": "s40171-023-00349-w.md"}
{"doc_id": 356, "text": "The goodness of the results of an AHP depends on the selected experts, and therefore their experience is considered a relevant parameter (Tsyganok et al., 2012). This work considered ten academics selected from authors who published works on sustainable mobility and EVs in the period 2022–2023 with at least ten years of experience (D'Adamo et al., 2023). The initial e-mail recalled the goal of the project, highlighted the differences with previous research work, and indicated the necessary steps. It also reported that only the first ten positive responses would be considered. Table S1 presents the list of academics with some characteristics, such as their role, country of reference, and years of experience. It shows that 20% of them are female.\n\nThe selection of criteria for continuity to the approach proposed in this work is defined in accordance with the literature (D'Adamo et al., 2023). However, this previous research presented thirteen criteria for RQ1 and twelve criteria for RQ2. Consequently, it may be necessary to use the local–global priority method, but although Saaty (2008) suggests that the best choice is a number of criteria equal to 5 ± 2, we analyzed that the value of RI is provided even for a number of criteria equal to ten. Therefore, an intermediate step for criteria formation was thought of. Therefore, the idea was to ask the first five experts who had expressed interest in participating in this analysis to indicate which criteria should be disregarded, as they were considered less important. For Table S2, it was requested\n''please insert an X to eliminate any of the following criteria. Specifically, the analysis will be repeated for a 10 9 10 matrix, so please indicate the 3 least relevant criteria.'' Results show that all experts indicated ''administrative benefits'' and ''noise abatement risk'' (due to quietness of vehicle toward people/animals). As for the third criterion to be eliminated, the choice fell on ''driving experience,'' which collected three negative opinions. It is shown that these three criteria were the ones that had gathered the least weight. In addition, it was suggested to change savings into economic savings in order to underline the economic dimension. As for Table S3, a similar approach was taken: ''please insert an X to eliminate any of the following criteria. Specifically, the analysis will be repeated for a 10 9 10 AHP, so please indicate the 2 least relevant criteria.'' The responses for that RQ saw a different situation from the previous one. Some experts (three out of five) identified the ''improve public mobility'' criterion not to be considered. This criterion was the second least relevant in the previous analysis. The last was increase ''incentives at the purchase stage,'' which in this pre-analysis garners on par with ''bonuses for returning old vehicles'' two out of five negative opinions. In addition, that criterion ''Reduce environmentally harmful subsidies'' was changed to ''Discourage the purchase of cars fuelled by fossil fuel'' as it allows for a better remark that no economic subsidy can be allocated to vehicles with high environmental impact. The solution, suggested by the experts themselves, was to combine them. After this intermediate step, it is possible to have a complete methodological framework. In fact, Fig. 1 shows the ten factors for RQ1 and RQ2.\n\nThe ten criteria were administered to the experts, who were given the opportunity to clarify doubts about the proposed alternatives through an online meeting. The excel sheet that the experts received showed that the analysis was conducted over the same time frame, but separately for the two RQs. In addition, it was specified to the five experts not chosen at the initial stage, the initial process that had led to considering ten criteria. The survey was conducted between February and March 2023, and the experts were informed of the automatic CR calculation within the sheet given to them.\n\nThe compilation of a 10 9 10 matrix turns out to be the most complex, in which forty-five responses are provided.\n\nEach expert can provide a score between 1 and 9 (Table S4) (Saaty, 2008). In addition, the normalized approach (Subramoniam et al., 2013) allows for the sum of all criteria to give a value of 1. CR, as stated above, is the ratio of CI to RI. CI is calculated as (kmax - n)/(n - 1), in which kmax is the inner product of the row vector containing column sums and the eigenvector matrix, and n is the number of criteria. Finally, RI is defined according to the number of criteria (Table S5).", "filename": "s40171-023-00349-w.md"}
{"doc_id": 357, "text": "The research adopts behavioral methodology in line with the literature (Sovacool et al., 2018), and questionnaires represent a quick and effective way to collect consumer opinions (Xia et al., 2022). In particular, the literature emphasizes the advantages associated with web-based questionnaires (Menegaki et al., 2016), which are found to be convenient and also adequately provide answers on the perception of EVs (Jaiswal et al., 2021). This form of survey is developed to understand consumer attitudes (Wu et al., 2020), and some analyses cover the Italian territory using either a hybrid approach with face-to-face interviews and Internet-based questionnaires (Giansoldati et al.,\n2018), or with an online-only survey approach (Danielis et al., 2020). Consequently given the potential expansion of EVs and Italy being a well-known country in the automotive industry, it is deemed useful to propose a new study. This online survey is geared toward providing\n\nThe questionnaire was administered through social channels (e.g., LinkedIn) during March 2023 according to the literature (Hoeft, 2021). A limitation of our approach is that we do not provide a participant compensation system that typically characterizes other online surveys (i.e.,\nAmazon Mechanical Turk platform) (Colasante et al.,\n2022).\n\nThe questionnaire was first validated by two experts from those proposed in the previous phase (Table S1) and consisted of 25 questions (Supplementary File). In addition, a filter question was asked at the beginning such that only people with a type B driver's license completed the questionnaire. Its purpose was introduced to the participants at the beginning of the questionnaire; in addition, anonymity was guaranteed. The total number of responses obtained was 252, and of these after the filter question, 241 remained.\n\nThe questionnaire was divided into six main sections:\n\nThe structure of the work provided two distinct methodologies to describe the three objectives. Specifically, the first two subsections are proposed for RQ1 and RQ2. In contrast, for the purpose of greater clarity on the representation of different outcomes for RQ3, seven additional subsections are proposed.\n\nThe aim of RQ1 was to understand what elements were influencing consumer buying behavior, and why the electric car market is struggling to grow today.\n\nTables S6–S15 show the weights provided by the experts related to RQ1. We would like to point out that the anonymity of experts is guaranteed since there is no correspondence with the number of experts provided in Table S1 (the same is true throughout the work). For example, expert no. 1 (E1) proposed that criterion F6\n(Purchase cost) has a higher impact than all the others, and it follows that it has an average weight of 0.23. Instead, expert no. 2 (E2) assigned it to criterion F1 (Battery autonomy) with an average value of 0.17. This analysis thus allows for the integration of different perspectives and relevance.\n\nIn accordance with the AHP methodology, the file provided by each expert was verified to be consistent. Once this step was performed on the CR, the different responses were aggregated individually (Table 1).\n\nThe findings show that most of the experts (7 out of 10)\nidentified F6 (Purchase cost) as the factor that most influences the results. In contrast, the remaining experts assigned relevance to three other factors: F1 (Battery autonomy), F4 (Purchase incentives) and F10 (Economic savings). The last step was to aggregate the ten averages from the experts considering that each of them had equal relevance—Fig. 2.\n\nThe AHP not only provides a ranking, but also quantifies the relevance of these factors, and factor F6 excels very significantly with 0.206 (factor average rate). This means that one-fifth of the weight is associated with this criterion alone. This factor together with the previous three and the F7 (Infrastructure) factor influences about 70% of consumer relevance according to expert opinions.\n\nThe aim of RQ2 was to understand what critical factors should be met to achieve a green transition in the electric mobility sector.\n\nRegarding RQ2, all pairwise-comparisons are proposed in Table S16–S25. Again, the two experts identified a different criterion that has greater relevance: E1 assigned it to criterion CF4 (Green energy production) with 0.22, while E2 assigned it to criterion CF10 (Battery recycling)\nwith 0.17. Also at this stage, it was verified that the experts' CR was consistent with what was expected.\n\nTable 2 aggregates the different judgments individually.", "filename": "s40171-023-00349-w.md"}

Also for this phase of the work, it is necessary to aggregate single contributions provided by experts considering that have the same relevance—Fig. 3.\n\nFor this RQ, there is no one critical factor that predominates over all the others; in fact, it can be seen that the difference between the first and fourth ranking RQ2 turns out to be 0.052, while the difference between the first and second ranking RQ1 was 0.070.

The results are separate for each of the six sections of the questionnaire.\n\nThe analysis of the questionnaire starts from the information provided in the last section. Regarding socio-demographic data, the sample analyzed is characterized by an average age of 34 years old, with a range of 18–80. The sample can be divided as follows: 18–24 years (37%),\n25–34 years (27%), 35–44 years (9%), 45–54 years (11%),\n55–64 years (14%) and [64 years (1%)—Fig. S1. As for gender predicts a slight presence of the male sample (56%)\ncompared to the female sample (43%)—Fig. S2. Educational qualification sees those with a bachelor's degree\n(34%) excel over diploma (29%) and master's degree (27%)—Fig. S3. Finally, the socio-demographic section considers the altruistic character of people where about half consider themselves more altruistic than selfish (51%). On a Likert scale of 1–5, there is a mean value of 3.9—Fig. S4.\n\nThe results of the first section highlight sustainable habits and a significant attention of consumers to environmental issues emerges. In fact, 50.6% of the sample gives a rating of ''agree'' and 30.7% ''very agree'' resulting in an average value of 4.1. Breaking down this value by age cluster\n(Fig. 4), it is evident that younger people (18–24 years, i.e., the largest sample of our respondents) are the least attentive on a daily basis to pursuing sustainable behaviors (mean value 4.0), while with increasing age, it tends to increase rather significantly reaching its peak (4.4) with the 35–44 years range. The data for consumers older than 64 years is not statistically significant numerically, as the sample is little. A regression analysis was also conducted to test for a correlation between consumers with virtuous sustainability behavior and character traits, given the value of 3.9 that emerged in Fig. S4. However, there is no evidence of a relationship between the two variables (Fig. 5).\n\nThe analysis of the first questions on EVs, unequivocally shows that few citizens own electric cars (7.5%) compared to internal combustion ones. This value highlights the need to produce such analyses in order to understand the reasons for this choice. Consumers are asked where they routinely park their cars, and whether they have the possibility of installing a charging station for an EV at this location. It turned out that the majority of the sample park their cars on the street (46.5%), with the remainder in private shelters\n(private driveway, condominium parking, shared garage, private garage)—Fig. S6. Of these, 59% would have the option of installing a charging station. Specifically analyzing the small sample of people with electric cars showed that only 11.1% of people park their cars on the street.\n\nCompared to the total sample, more than double the number of people shelter their car in a private garage\n(77.8%). This gives insight into how important it is today to have a private place in which to leave the car in charge. In fact, about 90% of people who own an electric car have the possibility of installing a charging station in the car's usual shelter (? 30% compared to the entire sample). In\n\nBreaking down the sample by age, it can be seen that it is the 18–24 age group that believes most in a price rise in the near future. As age increases, this belief decreases.\n\nThe second section of the questionnaire sought to extract the current state of consumer knowledge in the field of electric mobility by asking three questions using the Likert Scale (1–5). Consumers consider themselves neutrally informed about electric cars, with a mean value of 3.1.\n\nInstead, relevance is given to the source by which electric cars are recharged. In fact, a significant delta of 1.6 is recognized if cars are recharged with only energy obtained", "filename": "s40171-023-00349-w.md"}
{"doc_id": 360, "text": "The RQ3 analysis consists of several perspectives, and the third section of the questionnaire aims to investigate the more economic sphere of the respondents. We proceed below to analyze consumers' WTP. First, the information on WTP was extracted in the case where price was not a major constraint (a price in the range of 5000–65,000 € at intervals of 5000 € could be chosen). The mean value obtained was 29,515 € (Fig. 10). Analyzing by age, the clusters of 18–24 years, 25–34 and 35–44 turn out to be those with the highest WTP, with an average value above 30,000 € (Fig. S7).\n\nThe situation changes when consumers are asked about current WTP, considering price as the relevant variable. In this case, the younger cluster that the one previously found to have the highest WTP switches to having the lowest,\n\nThere is a sample of about 16.2% who would not change their choices on the classically powered car, while 57.7% would opt for a hybrid car. Analysis by age also shows that the 45–54 range is the least interested in purchasing the hybrid option, maximizing the choice toward the other two available options.\n\nNext, the analysis proceeds to focus on an additional filter. Indeed, it investigates who would be willing to pay a premium price for the electric car. The positive response concerns only 54.4% of the ''valid'' sample of 241 participants. We then proceed to the 110 respondents how much they recognize this premium price as a percentage.\n\nOn average, the consumers analyzed would be available to recognize a WTP equal to 14% more for an EV (Fig. 11).\n\nFig. 6 Consumer knowledge—\n\nAnother very interesting result is that consumers tend to give relevance to their needs. In fact, in a context where the price of the electric car is high, only a quarter of them would be willing not to buy the car by waiting for the price\n\nThese results indicates that only half of the people are willing to recognize a higher price to electric cars, and since the price of these cars is higher than that of internal combustion cars, this inevitably results in a severe restriction of the potential market. No significant differences are found on the data broken down by age (Fig. S10).\n\nMaking use of the data extracted in the previous sections of the questionnaire, an attempt was made to characterize and identify the 110 consumers who associate a premium price with the electric car. Specifically, this segment of consumers turns out to be more attentive in their daily lives to environmental issues, obtaining an average value of 4.4,\n\nThe fourth section aims to confront the consumer with a choice between the two alternatives concerning the entire Fig. 12 Future purchase\n\nThe sample surveyed gives a slight preference to the electric car (3.1) over the internal combustion car (2.8).\n\nHowever, the value that confirms what has emerged so far, which a strong perplexity about electric cars with a summary judgment is testifying to a rather neutral degree.\n\nAnalysis by age shows that the greatest propensity to purchase combustion vehicles is among younger people\n(range 18–24 presents a value of 3.2). The value is very peculiar since they are the only ones by age group that present a higher value than the EV. In this case, the highest value (equal to 3.25) is recorded for the 35–54 age group\n(Fig. S12).\n\nIn the next stage of the section, consumers were also faced with a purchase choice. The first question compared four vehicles, two electric vehicles (EVs) and two internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE vehicles), in which price is a constraint—Fig. 13:\n\nThe results confirm that for consumers at the time of purchase, the price parameter is paramount, taking precedence over vehicle performance. In fact, most of the Fig. 13 Consumers' car\n\nThe second question considers that the vehicles cost the same amount and the following characteristics are noted— Fig. 14:\n\nThere was a wish to go into greater detail regarding the analysis of consumers' purchase choice.

{"doc_id": 361, "text": "Despite the fact that this cluster of consumers is aware of the benefit of EVs and how to use them to extract the maximum emission reduction potential, the ICE vehicle is still preferred for the vast majority of consumers (60%),\nwhich represents an increase from the sample as a whole (? 3%). The difference from the sample as a whole appears to be a decrease in the choice of EV 2, in favor of the ICE vehicle. The result then is that the most informed and aware consumers would also seem to be the most price-conscious. Thus, it appears from this information that those who know that electric is sustainable if it is powered by renewable sources and have knowledge on the subject tend to choose ICE vehicles since under current conditions the choice of electric does not equate to environmental protection. Analyzing, again for the sample reduced to 41 respondents, the case in which price is not a relevant variable, it is possible to analyze how we still maintain a group of consumers who continue to prefer ICE vehicles (17%), which nevertheless represents a reduction compared to the sample as a whole (- 5%). This result confirms the previous point, as increased knowledge leads to the\n\nA second analysis is geared toward increasing the sample of people taken in the analysis. If in the previous analysis, only informed people were selected; now people with neutral knowledge are also included, thus obtaining a sample of 112 respondents. Those who provided the following values were chosen: (i) customer's knowledge in electric vehicles (3 or 4 or 5); (ii) decarbonization impact charging the vehicle only with green energy (3 or 4 or 5);\nand (iii) decarbonization impact charging the vehicle with fossil fuels and green energy (1 or 2 or 3)—Fig. 16.\n\nIn the price-constrained scenario, including people with a neutral level of knowledge in the cluster increased the relative choice of EV 2 compared to the sample of 41 respondents (? 2%) but still lower than the overall sample. There is also a decrease in the choice of EV 1 (- 4%) and an increase in ICE vehicles (? 2%). In the scenario where price is not a relevant variable, those who choose ICE vehicles increase (? 3.5%) compared to the 41-person cluster but still lower than the global sample. Again, the choice of EV2 (- 2%) exceeds the previous cluster but greater than the global cluster.\n\nIn order to complete the overview, the paper proceeds to a third analysis on these consumer choices between EVs and ICE vehicles—Fig. S13. We consider EVs to be a sustainable choice even if powered by fossil fuels. Then, we consider a cluster of 18 respondents, i.e., those who assigned 4 or 5 to the three questions in Sect. 2, a statistically less significant sample than the previous ones.\n\nHowever, a comparison with the overall sample shows that only 44.5% still choose ICE vehicles (- 12%); there is a tendency to prefer EV 2 more with 33.3% (? 8%), while in the absence of price limits, it is recorded that EV 2* is still preferred but there is a significant increase for EV 1*. These data show a gap on the degree of knowledge that is evidenced in a nonlinear choice, where price is a constraint people opt for the more expensive vehicle; otherwise, they tend toward a lower-performing choice. This is a sample that probably a priori considers electric—a correct choice even if fossil-fueled and does not present much attention to choose processes when comparisons are found.\n\nIn the fifth section of the questionnaire, the objective was to compare the values provided by consumers against what the experts proposed. Figure 17 proposed the data related to electric vehicle purchase, while Fig. 18 those related to sustainable electric mobility transition.\n\nConsumers appear to agree with the experts that purchase price is the criterion that most influences them in purchasing an electric car. The data emerging from this question corresponds to the previous ones from the consumer analysis, in which other technical features around a car, such as battery range, charging time and infrastructure, also appear to play a relevant role. These could also be seen as interrelated variables, in the presence of cars with a large range which would obviously decrease the need for a widespread charging infrastructure and vice versa.

{"doc_id": 362, "text": "Regarding the question on enabling factors toward a sustainable transition in electric mobility, different results emerge with the experts. In fact, the criterion ''increasing the presence of charging stations'' that was penultimate for experts occupies the first position for consumers. It seems to emerge that consumers look more closely at everyday needs. In second place, we find the criterion of green production, which, on the other hand, had been awarded as most relevant by the experts. This is crucial to ensure maximum reduction of CO2 emissions by electric cars. For the remaining criteria, an identical ranking position never occurred. Reducing the purchase price and improving battery range, which occupy a relevant position for consumers, highlight that the perspective that has emerged from consumers is the absence of an overview, which limits the full understanding of development of the sector.\n\nIndeed, these are the criteria that are most relevant to everyday life. Again, it emerges that the gap between the first and penultimate criteria appears to be small at 0.45 (4.41 vs. 3.96).\n\nThis analysis shows that there is a knowledge gap, as not all consumers understand that an electric vehicle is always sustainable. People look a lot at the presence of charging stations so as to save time, but although renewable sources have a high position, they occupy second place. It is assumed that this can also be explained by those who consider an EV sustainable even if it is powered by fossil sources. The lower knowledge on sustainability is then expanded by the lower weight associated with battery recycling compared to the second place recorded by experts. It should be said that the consumers did not do a pairwise comparison, so they analyzed the variables individually, and the range of difference between the parameters is much smaller. The first seven criteria actually tend by approximation all to 4.5. However, it is evident how consumers' thinking is not fully informed. Thus, the social data on the industrial development of the sector is not surprising in this direction, confirming the point made in the previous point. It is given a similar value as the battery.\n\nAn additional finding that confirms the knowledge bias is the following: There is a tendency to want to reduce the purchase price of these vehicles (probably through subsidies), but if you combine this policy choice with providing a bonus for dated vehicles, you consider it less valuable.\n\nThe results of this work, related to RQ1, confirm the relevance of the first two criteria (purchase cost and battery autonomy) already proposed in the literature (D'Adamo et al., 2023), while slightly less importance is given to infrastructure. In fact, it is assumed that this aspect tends to decrease as several initiatives are being developed in this direction (Huang et al., 2022). Regarding the purchase price, a number of measures have been introduced in Italy at both the national and regional levels to reduce the initial cost. In addition to this, other economic incentives have been introduced to reduce the total cost of ownership, including exemption from payment of road tax for five years upon purchase (thereafter, tax reduced to one-fourth of the internal combustion equivalent) and possibility of access to restricted traffic zones. These concessions aim to make the total cost of ownership of the EV, thus the cost of the vehicle over its lifetime, comparable to that of a conventionally powered vehicle, despite the fact that the purchase price is higher to date and is one of the main barriers to purchasing an electric car (Franzo` et al., 2022). It is therefore also necessary to inform and raise awareness among consumers, as the enabling factors for the green transition may be primarily monetary (Colasante et al., 2022) or also related to personal and social norms (Niamir et al., 2020).", "filename": "s40171-023-00349-w.md"}
{"doc_id": 363, "text": "Another reason for the low uptake of electric cars lies in the fear that the car will only travel a few kilometers due to the limited battery range and the still-poor charging infrastructure. However, the average daily mileage of the latest electric car models highlights significant improvements (Abid et al., 2022). As highlighted above, the economic side plays a key role; however, experts favored the cost required to purchase an EV and not the potential benefits. Certainly, incentive policies can reduce these costs, but they should have their own justification for the purpose of welfare to civil society. However, it is often incentive policies that determine the sustainable development of an industry (De Santis et al., 2022; Srivastava et al., 2022). At the same time, economic benefits are manifested if the energy is self-generated; otherwise, there is a risk of manifesting not economic savings but a higher cost given trends in electricity prices (Colasante et al., 2022). Furthermore, the infrastructure aspect differs in that appears to be still underdeveloped. The charging network, both public and private, is of paramount importance as the infrastructure is an indispensable functional component on par with traditional gas stations (LaMonaca & Ryan, 2022).\n\nThe positive externalities that are potentially created by the use of an EV lie in its respect for the environment and contribution to society, which, however, according to experts are a factor that is marginally considered by consumers. This is quite worrying and leads to the need to have to inform and raise consumer awareness of the negative externalities of everyday mobility. At the same time, the communications of policy makers should also be improved (Kim et al., 2022). However, the issue of sustainable education is essential to foster stakeholders' engagement. Similarly, recharging time is not significant; according to experts, it is much more relevant to have a battery with a larger capacity, which allows the consumer to carry out daily dynamics without having to stop and recharge the car. With a sufficiently large battery capacity, the car could be charged overnight, and therefore the speed of charging is not relevant (Ye et al., 2022). Finally, the least important factors are noise pollution and operating costs. In particular, the latter factor shows a reduction in significance compared to the literature (D'Adamo et al.,\n2023), probably determined by a direct comparison with respect to investment (purchase) costs.\n\nThe findings of this work, related to RQ2, confirm the relevance of the first three critical factors (CF4, CF5 and CF10) that had already been proposed in the literature\n(D'Adamo et al., 2023). However, a fourth element (CF1)\nis added to these, but this result depends on the combination of two previously considered factors. Electric cars are proposed as a driver of sustainable mobility; however, electric mobility is sustainable when fuel is considered to be obtained totally from renewable sources. Literature showed that the emissions associated with such a vehicle were 5 gCO2eq/km, and the same value associated with CNG vehicles was powered by biomethane (DENA, 2011).\n\nIn contrast, vehicles associated with the European energy mix about a decade ago had a value of 75 gCO2eq/km reported. The current situation does not see totally green European countries, so this aspect is emphasized by the experts. So, it is pointed out that EVs to really cut emissions need to be powered through renewable energy.", "filename": "s40171-023-00349-w.md"}
{"doc_id": 364, "text": "Sustainability concerns not only economic and environmental aspects, but also social ones. The electrical sector is changing the automotive industry, requiring as much new professionalism as new raw materials. This aspect is reflected in two other very relevant critical factors. Industrial development of the sector is needed to maintain jobs so as not to create social unsustainability. Therefore, there is a need to generate learning programs for those currently working in this sector and to make use of new professionals. The absence of an industrial economy leads to a weakening of a country's economic system and the risk of facing speculative market turbulence. In addition, batteries have the advantage of storing energy but nevertheless, the issue of their recycling is an aspect to be paid attention (Sathish Kumar et al., 2023). Moreover, this aspect also risks fostering speculative aspects or geopolitical risks, since their resources are mainly located in certain areas of the world. Therefore, it becomes strategic first to ensure that technologies exist that can recover critical materials and components found in these products (Ippolito et al., 2023; Rosa & Terzi, 2016), and then resources from end-of-life vehicles need to be acquired in order to have resources that these countries would not otherwise have. However, while incentives play a key role, it is believed that the suitable solution for mobility conversion requires a combined policy intervention. It is necessary to provide incentives for the purchase of EVs but linked to bonuses that can be given if old cars are scrapped. Recycling of some components of cars are able to genre industrial ecosystem in which opportunities are manifold and circular economy practices totally become part of the automotive business (Cozza et al., 2023; Yuik et al., 2022).\n\nIn the direction of modernizing the vehicle fleet, we also need to discourage the purchase of non-new-generation fossil fuel vehicles (Leach et al., 2020). The European direction toward that view all need to be observed that some heat engines could be powered by renewable sources. This opens up the need for further analysis. Here, a gap emerges in this work that does not evaluate a comparison of different sustainable modes in the automotive sector, which are clearly not only achievable through EVs.\n\nTwo critical factors that emerged relevant in RQ1 receive less attention in RQ2 (reducing purchase price and improving battery autonomy). This turns out that was already present in the previous work (D'Adamo et al.,\n2023), so in this analysis, it was explored with experts whether a potential cause was the redundancy of factors in both RQs. The conclusion was that these aspects are very relevant at the stage of consumer purchase of an electric vehicle, and they are less so for the green transition of electric mobility. A similar argument is proposed for the presence of charging stations. Finally, another comparison with previous research work (D'Adamo et al., 2023) shows that purchase price and consumer awareness are the critical factors that receive the least importance, in favor of the combined policy intervention mentioned above. Electricity price regulation, probably considered more of a macroeconomic issue, closes the ranking.\n\nThese responses of RQ2 highlight that unlike the previous one (RQ1), a trade-off among several items is more required, and therefore a flexible solution to the sustainable mobility of the future is in demand. In fact, electric cars have advantages but to date do not perfectly hinge all the requirements. Likewise, this vision changes according to the territorial reality considered (Molla et al., 2023; Zahraee et al., 2018). The challenge of sustainable mobility can be met through two basic requirements:\n\nThe issue of sustainability is changing all existing models, as climate change is confronting humankind with an objective situation: ecosystems are experiencing a period of crisis. It therefore seems clear that actions are necessary because future generations must not give up opportunities. Europe aiming to be climate neutral is an ambitious and correct goal. However, the choices made should move toward pragmatic and not ideological sustainability. That is, the concept of sustainability covers not only the environmental, but also the economic and social spheres. The 2035 changes for the automotive sector move toward the right goal of decarbonizing the transportation system, but some concerns emerge. In fact, there is a need to relocate from a social point of view people who are likely to be unemployed, and from an economic point of view, some products (e.g., electric cars) might be purchasable only by those with significant incomes. In this way, poorer people might be asked to pay a higher price tomorrow.", "filename": "s40171-023-00349-w.md"}
{"doc_id": 365, "text": "The key word in this context could be flexibility, which allows for continued maximization of production from renewable energy sources, making the electric vehicle effectively green. However, this is not enough, as there is a need for research and development to give support to battery recycling but at the same time to create local industrial development that counteracts social unsustainability from a labor employment perspective. The needs expressed by experts do not find a similar sharing of thought with consumers. The characteristic of the need for charging stations is considered by them to be the most relevant. However, the questionnaire brought out some sustainability bias; first of all that for some people, an electric vehicle is sustainable even if it is powered by fossil fuels. Another finding is how the very young in the near future would tend more to buy an internal combustion engine than an electric vehicle. In this direction, the knowledge provided during the university course needs to be strengthened. Another aspect to highlight is the choice of a suggested policy for the future: an incentive that could support the development of electric vehicles but overcoming the critical issues highlighted above. Such a choice could also include the recycling of old vehicles to achieve a flexible industrial ecosystem. In fact, flexible management through this policy instrument could reduce the impact of purchase cost, which is the main hindering factor in purchasing such products (a view shared by consumers and experts) combined with green and circular practices that combine renewable production with reuse/ recycling/remanufacturing. The willingness to pay extra for an electric vehicle exists for only less than half of the surveyed sample, and there are also consumers who have no intention of giving up internal combustion vehicles.\n\nThis work therefore calls for the need to develop life cycle analyses of these products and to include externalities in this computation. Similarly, sustainable alternatives to each other in the transportation sector are not directly compared, but it seems important to involve stakeholders in the decision-making process based on the role of flexibility in the automotive sector where there is no single dominant technological model.\n\nFunding Open access funding provided by Universita` degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

Breakthroughs in mobile technology, an influx of new urban mobility options and changes in travel behavior have significantly altered today's transportation landscape - a trend that is likely only to accelerate in the years ahead. \n\nThe use of new, shared forms of transportation —from carsharing and bikesharing to dynamic, IT-enabled shuttle services and carpooling apps—has increased exponentially. At the same time, drivers' licensing rates among younger generations have declined as the national perspective shifts from \"I own and use my own transportation\" to \"I access a menu of mobility options to meet my needs.\" These new services also offer opportunities to: - Provide more mobility choices - Offer first- and last-mile solutions to help riders connect with transit\n- Reduce traffic congestion, vehicle miles traveled and greenhouse gas emissions\n- Lessen parking pressures and free up land for new uses 1\n- Create independence for those who cannot afford to buy and maintain a vehicle\n- Reduce transportation costs for households - Provide new opportunities to earn extra income by renting out excess vehicle capacity\n- Increase efficiency and convenience, especially when these modes are linked together This disruption in the transportation industry has also raised important new questions about how we get from point A to B, with farreaching implications for auto manufacturers, \n\nE\n\nD\n\nThe **Shared-Use Mobility Center** (SUMC) was founded in 2014 to document and explore new solutions related to shared mobility. SUMC is a public-interest organization working to foster collaboration and help connect the growing industry with transit agencies, cities and communities across the nation. Through piloting programs, conducting new research and providing advice and expertise to cities and regions, SUMC hopes to extend the benefits of shared mobility for all. In its first year, SUMC's work has included designing carsharing pilot projects in Los Angeles and Chicago; hosting shared mobility conferences and workshops; developing interactive tools to help cities benchmark and expand shared mobility systems; and conducting national studies exploring the relationship between shared mobility and traditional fixed-route public transit. By creating the **Shared-Use Mobility Reference** Guide, SUMC hopes to provide government, business, and community leaders with an introduction to shared-use mobility and help prepare them to address the rapid changes currently taking place in cities across the nation. \n\nBIKE SHARING\nE\nD\nO\n# Shared-Use Mobility \n\nAs the shared mobility industry grows—and becomes more complicated and complex—establishing definitions for common terms and issues has become increasingly vital. Definitions are especially important because they are often codified in public policy and determine standing for incentive programs and regulation. Understanding the various modes also helps cities and providers collaborate and determine what services work and where. Following is an overview of definitions for common shared mobility modes.\n\nGPStechnology directly into the bikes themselves as opposed to docks. The bikes often also have their own locks, allowing users to secure them to any public bike rack within a predetermined service area.\n\nUnlike most other new forms of shared mobility, bikeshare systems like New York's Citi Bike and Chicago's Divvy are often publicly owned and contractor operated through the use of public-private partnerships. In other cities like Minneapolis, the systems are run by nonprofit organizations. Perhaps because of its close connection to the public sector, bikesharing is viewed as a form of public transit much more commonly than other forms of shared mobility.\n\nCarsharing is a service that provides members with access to an automobile for short-term—usually hourly—use. In 2014, U.S. carsharing membership reached approximately 1.34 million people.3", "filename": "Reference-Guide-Editsweb-version-10.24.2016_1.md"}
{"doc_id": 368, "text": "Car rental companies and manufacturers are increasingly playing a major role in this sector. Avis Budget Group (buyer of Zipcar), Enterprise (buyer of IGO Carsharing) and Daimler, BMW, Toyota, Ford and Volkswagen are all active in carsharing markets across the globe. In many ways, carsharing is becoming an expected part of the urban fabric. Zipcar, once only familiar to 20-somethings, has become a household name. However, it too continues to innovate through testing new models such as Zipcar ONE>WAY to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nMemberships\n\nRidesourcing providers such as Uber and Lyft \n—codified in California law as **Transportation** Network Companies (TNCs)—use online platforms to connect passengers with drivers who use personal, non-commercial, vehicles. Ridesourcing has become one of the most recognized and ubiquitous forms of shared mobility. Uber, for example, is currently valued at more than $50 billion and operates in 60 countries and approximately 300 cities worldwide.5 Because, at least initially, they have been less regulated than the traditional taxi and limo services they compete with, TNCs have also generated some controversy and have been banned by some governments. Recently, several cities—including Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, D.C. and Chicago —have begun developing their own universal e-hailing apps to help level the playing field between cabs and TNCs. New, specialized ridesourcing services have also emerged. These include Shuddle, which focuses on providing safe rides for children, and Lift Hero, which uses certified medical personnel to safely transport elderly passengers. It is also worth noting that TNCs such as Uber and Lyft have begun providing services in select cities such as San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles that combine fares to reduce vehicle trips and generate cost savings. UberPOOL and Lyft Line allow drivers to add additional passengers to a trip in real-time. These services are known as **\"ride-splitting\"—**since the passengers split the cost of the trip—and are continuing to evolve as companies experiment with various models. \n\nCarpools typically involve travelers riding together to save on fuel and \n\nVanpooling is often run by public transit systems and allows groups of commuters (often co-workers) to share a ride. Vanpooling is similar to carpooling, but on a larger scale.\n\nReal-time ridesharing matches drivers and passengers based on destination through a mobile app before the trip starts. The passenger is usually expected to pay a share of the trip cost. Ridesharing apps such as Tripda and Blablacar have become immensely popular in Europe, but have been slow to attract users in the U.S. \n\nRidesharing is one of the most visible and rapidly evolving areas of shared mobility, and therefore one of heightened importance. As suggested by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Volpe Center, ridesharing has the potential to help us reach the tipping point at which the full suite of transportation options—including shared mobility—becomes \"reliable, convenient, affordable and otherwise attractive enough to compete with single occupant automobile travel.\" 6\n\nTransit—publicly owned fleets of buses, trains, ferries, facilities and rights of way, with fixed route local and express service—is the foundation for much of shared-use mobility. Not only could transit be considered the original form of shared-use mobility, but it also plays a vital role in creating an environment where newer shared modes can thrive. There is also great untapped potential for transit agencies to integrate with or offer new shared-use travel options to increase access to transportation and lower costs. \n\nSeveral cities have begun testing bikesharing systems that feature electric, pedal-assist bikes, a trend that is expected to continue in coming years. Scooter sharing, popular in some European cities, makes fleets of motorized scooters available to users by the minute or hour. Companies have also begun experimenting with sharing systems using new, compact electric vehicles such as Renault's Twizy twoseater and Toyota's iRoad that are expected to work well for short, 2-3 mile trips.\n\nMost recently, IT-enabled private shuttle services such as Bridj, Via and Chariot have emerged that serve passengers using dynamically generated routes. Because they provide transit-like service but on a smaller, more flexible scale, these new services have been referred to as \"microtransit.\" In general, they draw customers who are willing to pay somewhat more for greater comfort and service. The dynamic route-generating technology used by many of these services also has tremendous potential for transit and paratransit services.\n\nTraditional shuttle services include corporate, regional and local shuttles that make limited stops, often only picking up the employees of specific companies. One example is the Google Bus which, along with bus services owned by several other technology companies, drives San Francisco-based employees to and from Silicon Valley.

{"doc_id": 369, "text": "Taxis and limos are regulated for-hire vehicles that pick up passengers via street hails or prearrangement. With taxis, the fare is typically meter-based. \n\nJitneys have traditionally been privately-owned vehicles that operate like taxis or buses, but often without official licenses. Jitneys traditionally have been used for transportation in low-income neighborhoods, which often have limited access to public transportation and poor taxi service. Jitney vehicles are typically smaller than buses and usually take passengers on a fixed or semi-fixed route without timetables.\n\nAggregation companies are focused on building entire bundles of services along with apps for integrating them. For instance, in 2012 German auto manufacturer Daimler launched Moovel, a smartphone and online mobility platform that shows users the best way to reach their destination using a variety of modes (including car2go, Daimler's one-way carsharing service). Mobile apps such as RideScout (also now owned by Daimler), Transit App and CityMapper also aggregate information to provide users with a menu of real-time transportation options—including transit, taxi service, carsharing, bikesharing and ridesourcing—to get their destination. Many of these companies are also working on ways to integrate mobile payment into their service. For instance, in June 2015, RideScout acquired Globe Sherpa, a company that provides mobile book-and-pay ticketing systems for public transportation in several major U.S. cities.\n\nShared-use mobility also has great potential for the commercial delivery sector. Shared trucks, electric vehicles and light electric-assist cargo bikes can deliver goods at a lower cost than trucks in many situations. This is a niche that could take off quickly due to growing demand for immediate deliveries. For instance, Internet retailer Amazon and the grocery delivery company Instacart both recently announced one-hour delivery in some markets. Meanwhile, new app-based services such as Dolly and Schlep connect people to neighbors who own trucks for on-demand moving and delivery. \n\nSeveral cities in the U.S. have taken steps to support development of integrated mobility hubs, which feature multiple transportation modes combined in one location. For example, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation is launching a three-year demonstration program, which includes mobility hubs at key transit station nodes anchored by secure bicycle parking plus bike- and carsharing access. Riders will be able to use smart phones and smartcards for reservations, simple fare collection and automated billing. Additionally, there will be a special focus on access needs for low-income customers.7\n\nThe Benefits of \n\nShared-Use Mobility Part II \n8 Moving Together in the 21st Century: How Ride-sharing Supports Livable Communities, U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, June 2013. 9 Martin, Shaheen, Lidicker, The Impact of Carsharing on Household Vehicle Holdings: Results from a North American Shared-Use Vehicle Survey, 2010. 10 *Getting More with Less: Managing Residential Parking in Urban Developments with Carsharing and Unbundling, Nelson Nygaard for City CarShare,* \nDecember 2011.\n\nThe economic and social benefits of shared mobility are significant and wide-ranging. Many have suggested that new, innovative forms of shared transportation can help reduce VMT and emissions as well as car ownership rates and household transportation costs. Shared mobility can also encourage greater use of transit, open up more land for parks and other public space and help improve users' health by encouraging biking, walking and other forms of active transportation. At the same time, however, more independent research must be done to substantiate current data, and agreement is also needed on the appropriate methodologies used for benefits analysis.8 Local governments need more information to decide how to allocate scarce resources, integrate shared modes into transportation management plans and provide incentives to encourage greater use of shared-use mobility. State and federal governments need the same data to justify new regulations and policies that support the growth of shared mobility. Following is a breakdown of the benefits cataloged to date for carsharing, bikesharing and ridesourcing providers like Uber and Lyft, along with an overview of emerging new research on the benefits of shared mobility.", "filename": "Reference-Guide-Editsweb-version-10.24.2016_1.md"}
{"doc_id": 370, "text": "The literature on changes in vehicle ownership associated with carsharing membership is well established. A widely cited 2010 University of California, Berkeley study found that between 9 and 13 cars are sold or not purchased for each carshare car.9 Studies have also shown carsharing members enjoy significant reductions in their cost of living and increase their use of public transit. For instance, a 2011 study from City Carshare noted that more than 65 percent of respondents with carsharing memberships take transit a few times a week or more compared to approximately 41 percent of respondents without carsharing memberships.10 Research also suggests that, since carsharing members often shed older vehicles, the new carsharing cars that replaced them were much more efficient, averaging 10 more miles per gallon and resulting in lower fuel costs and greenhouse gas emissions.11 While the effects of oneway carsharing have not been studied as closely, operator car2go has estimated that more than 2,000 of its Seattle members have sold their personal vehicles since joining.12 Car2go has estimated that more than 2,000 of its Seattle members have sold their personal vehicles since joining. \n\nUC Berkeley's North American Bikesharing Survey, completed in 2014, found that bikesharing reduced respondents' driving by large margins. In Montreal and Toronto, 29 percent and 35 percent reported driving less, respectively. In Minneapolis and Salt Lake City, 53 percent and 55 percent noted driving less.13 This report and a 2013 Capital Bikeshare Member Survey also found that 4 to 5 percent of members sold a household vehicle and cited bikesharing as a factor in their decision. The Capital Bikeshare study found an average driving reduction of 198 miles per year. 14\n\nA 2014 UC Berkeley intercept survey limited to three \"hotspots\" in San Francisco found that ridesourcing \"appears to substitute for longer public transit trips but otherwise complements transit.\"15 Ridesourcing provider Lyft has also noted that 25 percent of its trips in the San Francisco area are to or from Caltrain stations. 16 To get a better handle on benefits requires consistent impact measures and methodologies. Further benefit analysis is also needed to assess each mode and portfolios of modes for households (e.g. cost savings) and communities (e.g. access, congestion, air quality). Benefits analysis requires controlled experiments that compare transportation behavior with and without shared-use modes. However, it has been a challenge to get the data needed to analyze the impacts due to privacy concerns and companies' efforts to protect their competitive advantages.\n\nShared Mobility Benefit Examples (Source: Shared-Use Mobility Center) \nIf 10% of households became carshare members, there would be:\n\nFewer Vehicles 50,000 31,000 30,000 5,000 3,000\n\nFewer Vehicle Miles \n\nTraveled\n\nMillions annually\n\nFewer Gallons of Gasoline\n\nUsed, thousands annually\n\nCO2 Reductions\n\nMetric tons reduced annually 109,000 67,000 64,000 11,000 5,000\n\nSan \n\nFrancisco Bay \n\nArea\n\nChicago Houston Atlanta **Salt Lake City**\n\nTo increase the capacity for benefits calculations, SUMC created a visual forecasting tool that can be used to illustrate the effects of policy changes and program investments.

In some cities, carsharing and bikesharing have achieved enough scale to truly change the transportation landscape, while other cities have services that aren't distributed equitably, are extremely limited, or are even lacking altogether. Regardless of their progress, however, nearly every city seems to be asking the same question: what is the potential for shared mobility in our region, and how can we best tap it? To help answer that question, SUMC has developed a model for estimating shared mobility infrastructure feasibility in a city, the benefits this infrastructure will produce, and the policy changes, if any, that are needed to make it happen. \n\nAlthough rapid innovation can break these rules, there are some general rules of thumb on where certain shared transportation modes work best: - Bikeshare works best as a first/last mile transportation strategy in mixed-use neighborhoods and near transit hubs in walkable corridors with high pedestrian traffic. ", "filename": "Reference-Guide-Editsweb-version-10.24.2016_1.md"}
{"doc_id": 371, "text": "These rules of thumb are supported by existing research which suggests that shared-use transportation modes require a minimum level of population, household density, mix of uses, percentage of transit commuters and walkability to flourish. To date, density—both in terms of households and availability of services—has been used as the primary predictor of success for carsharing. Shared vehicles benefit from being located within a short walk of customers. At the same time, a mix of residences and businesses ensures that shared vehicles are used weekdays, weeknights, and weekends, making the numbers work. \n\nResearch has cited density as even more important for bikesharing, which depends heavily on convenience to attract riders. For instance, a recent NACTO report suggests that bikeshare stations should be no more than 1,000 feet apart—or about a five-minute walk—to attract a high volume of \n\nMuch of the research on siting shared mobility systems is now more than a decade old in an industry that has radically changed in the last 24 months. Furthermore, a new cultural context is emerging as social entrepreneurs focus on developing technological solutions that work for everyone, not just niche markets. To help shed new light on these issues, SUMC's work has focused on adding new dimensions to existing analysis of where shared-use transportation works. Early findings show that the neighborhoods that have shared mobility-supportive qualities but do not have access to shared mobility services are often low to moderate-income. SUMC hopes that by providing the data to demonstrate the potential within these communities, it can help to eliminate misperceptions and open up new opportunities for shared mobility.\n\nEquity and \n\nShared-use mobility can be especially valuable for residents of low-and moderate-income communities. Working families spend a large portion of their income on transportation costs. A vast majority of these transportation costs are fixed because they are associated with private car ownership. According to AAA, the average annual cost of owning and operating a mid-size car is nearly $9,000.21 In comparison, a member of City Carshare, a non-profit carshare organization based in San Francisco, CA, pays on average $540 annually to make use of the carsharing service. Several studies have proven that carsharing members reduce or avoid purchasing cars in their household. A 2009 survey of IGO Carsharing members in Chicago found that 73 percent of IGO members sold a car or were able to avoid purchasing a car after joining IGO. Yet, customers of shared mobility services largely have been younger, well-educated, upper-income residents. This is the case not only for private sector providers of carsharing, ridesharing, and ridesourcing, but also public bikesharing. Bikeshare membership has been underrepresented among people making under $50,000 in four cities where the income of members was studied: the Twin Cities, Salt Lake City, Washington D.C., and Toronto.22 This is one reason why the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) launched the Better Bikeshare Partnership in conjunction with PeopleforBikes and The JPB Foundation to test bikesharing programs that focus on equity. SUMC is involved in many experiments to spread the benefits of shared-use mobility. SUMC's team and partners already have learned a great deal about how to make this happen and are involved in the development of new approaches based upon this experience. \n\nWhile it is not yet fully realized, the potential for shared-use modes to serve \n\nNonprofit shared-use mobility providers have been targeting low- and \n\nFeigon and Randall found that success for carsharing in disadvantaged \n\nInternet-based outreach Boulder Housing Partners (BHP), a local housing authority in Boulder, Colorado, has incorporated many of these practices into its relatively new partnership \n\nBikesharing organizations also have learned a great deal about how to serve low- and moderate-income residents, including offering deeply discounted annual memberships based on income, engaging in local marketing, offering materials in multiple languages and providing access to checking accounts or credit cards. Boston's Hubway bikesharing system has sold more than 1,300 subsidized memberships, comprising more than 11 percent of its riders, compared to a U.S. average of closer to 5 percent lowincome bikeshare users.24 Nice Ride Minnesota launched the Community Partners program with Target Corporation to partner with area service organizations to recruit low-income students and residents and offer them free memberships, a helmet, a demo ride, and internet access. This program attracted 884 Minneapolis and St. Paul members by 2014.25 Their next steps seem to echo the experience of the nonprofit carsharing companies that built demand through grassroots networking, relationship building and education.

After studying two years of data from Getaround, NYU professor Arun Sundararajan and research scientist Samuel Fraiberger found that lower-income consumers were more likely to rent from others and rent out their possessions through P2P systems. SUMC's goal is to work with Getaround to determine how to structure P2P to best serve moderateincome communities and suburban areas.26 A Federal Highway Administration grant administered through the Chicago Department of Transportation and the Illinois Department of Transportation supports the project. \n\nThe goal of the Los Angeles carsharing pilot project is to double the presence of carsharing in the City of Los Angeles and radically improve the availability of the service to low-income Angelenos by adding 150 vehicles in disadvantaged communities. Most of these vehicles will be Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) or Plug-in Hybrids (PHEV), and will be operated by leading industry operators who have offered to partner on this project. The City of Los Angeles is the lead agency on this proposal with SUMC as technical assistance lead. The project will also draw from a steering committee of community organizations, including the Coalition for Clean Air, Communities for a Better Environment, East LA Community Corporation, LA Mas, Korean Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA), Move LA, OATH Ventures and T.R.U.S.T. South LA. \n\nLocal Government \n\nGiven the paucity of local and federal transportation funding for new infrastructure, shared mobility may be one of the most efficient and economical options to help cities quickly expand service, meet increased demand, improve access in low-income and low-density areas, reduce air pollution and lessen traffic congestion and pressure on parking space supply. As new shared-use service offerings proliferate, however, city governments have often found themselves playing catch-up, quickly passing new policies and gauging their effectiveness as they go. Some still are not sure whether these new services will enhance their existing transit services or compete with them. Many local governments have struggled to anticipate challenges and opportunities and to balance divergent goals, including: - Maximizing access - Preserving safety - Ensuring support for public transit networks - Managing traffic - Allocating parking and other uses of curb space - Ensuring all communities are served - Providing clear and consistent guidelines for a quickly evolving industry\n\nThe environment that has resulted is one filled with innovation, but also chaos. The focus on catch-up has meant few cities have developed a long-term vision for a public-private mobility world. City and transit agencies have also not had a chance to reorganize or build new capacities, resulting in some confusion as to who is best suited to oversee these new modes of transportation. City departments of transportation own the streets, for instance, while transit agencies manage transit, and planners make decisions about use of the right-of-way. Other agencies regulate taxis and determine tax rates for carsharing. For shared-use transportation to thrive, public agencies that previously worked in silos will need to collaborate with each other and with private companies to find the right mix of government policies at the local, state, and federal level. \n\nEvery city has its own transportation and land use policies, so each needs to find its own path to address these issues. Still, the key steps and players could be quite similar across cities. Following are some emerging best practices for cities, many of which were drawn from a framework created by the Frontier Group for the U.S. PIRG Education Fund and further developed by SUMC.27\n\nEvery city has its own transportation and land use policies, so each needs to find its own path to address these issues.", "filename": "Reference-Guide-Editsweb-version-10.24.2016_1.md"}
{"doc_id": 373, "text": "To succeed, cities need tools for optimizing their transportation mix based upon local goals and achieving economies of scale for alternatives. They need frameworks for how to get \"shared-use mobility ready\" through land use planning and zoning, system design, information services and processes for bringing together transit operators, transportation departments, developers, property owners and vendors. They need model policies and guidance on how to address key challenges such as lack of data and poor integration. And they need examples from other cities that have gone first. To advance shared mobility, cities also need funding. States could play a key role because federal funding apportionment to states is flexible, but most are not using this funding to its full potential. Cities also need federal support. While other countries such as Germany have accelerated the adoption of shared mobility through government support, the U.S. largely has not.28 Federal policy could help local transit agencies by providing support for rapid experimentation with new, more flexible modes. As pointed out by Tim Papandreou, Strategic Planning & Policy Director for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, it is too hard to find special funding every time a city wants to run a carsharing pilot or create new street designs for shared mode parking.29 Securing such support, however, will likely require national coalition building.\n\nCities are accelerating the passage of new policies to protect residents and spur innovation in urban mobility. Recently, SUMC began tracking their progress through a database that summarizes more than 500 of the most important shared-use mobility policies, studies and strategic plans in the United States. \n\nSUMC's shared mobility policy database features national policies as well as regulations and ordinances from states and cities that are leading the pack in addressing new developments in shared transportation. To get a better idea of where shared mobility may be heading, it is worthwhile to look back and see how policies and regulations have evolved. Interestingly, some city and state governments began addressing issues related to shared mobility more than 20 years ago: \n- One of the oldest policies in the database is a piece of legislation from 1990 on transportation services for individuals with disabilities (stemming from the Americans with Disabilities Act) that included public transportation providers as well as taxis and vanpools. Interestingly, elements of this legislation are beginning to show up in new policies as a few cities have asked carsharing providers and TNCs to include wheelchair-accessible vehicles.\n\nPOLLUTION/ENVIRONMENT\nRIDESOURCING/TNCS\nLAND USE/ZONINGCARSHARETDMBICYCLES\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160\n\nPARATRANSIT\n\nPRIVATE TRANSIT\nSHUTTLES/VANPOOLS\nTECHNOLOGY\nFARES/FEES/REVENUESSAFETY\nFLEET MANAGEMENT\nRIDESHARE/CARPOOLTAXIS\nINSURANCE/LIABILITY\nPUBLIC TRANSIT\nINFRASTRUCTUREPARKING\nShared Mobility Related Topic\n\nAustin, Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle are among the most prolific policymakers in SUMC's database. Many of the policies they have passed address the same modes. For instance, all four cities have passed carsharing regulations. Three of them have passed TNC policies (and San Francisco's lives under a state policy). Following is a snapshot of the policies each city has enacted.\n\nNumber of References in Policy Database\n\nSUMC's policy database also includes policy case reports that reveal some issues to watch, including: \n\nOne of the biggest policy issues for the carsharing sector is access to parking. In July 2013, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) launched a two-year pilot program to allow carshare vehicles to locate in regulated parking spots on city streets. Only traditional and peer-to-peer carsharing organizations may participate (not one-way carsharing). The SFMTA board of directors must approve parking permits. As of January 2015, SFMTA had approved three carsharing organizations, and 450 parking spots had been requested out of 900 possible in the pilot. Outreach to neighboring residents and businesses has helped to reduce conflicts over this use of parking spaces, but there has been some debate about the program in the media. Washington, D.C. has also made parking available for one-way carsharing. In 2005, the district began providing curbside parking spaces for carsharing vehicles. Today there are 224 on-street spaces in 84 locations. Carsharing operators permitted to use these spots must have at least one car in each D.C. \n\nTNCs first tried to muscle their way into cities and now are trying a softer approach. Many operated without approval for months but are now becoming legal in more and more cities, such as Chicago, Seattle, Washington, D.C., Dallas, Nashville, Cincinnati, San Antonio, Austin and Chattanooga, to name just a few.", "filename": "Reference-Guide-Editsweb-version-10.24.2016_1.md"}
{"doc_id": 374, "text": "Conflict over regulation of TNCs is not over. Current California law explicitly prohibits charging passengers on an individual basis, excepting certain school and tour buses. As a result, shared ride services offered by TNCs in which passengers pay separately are disallowed. In September 2014, the California PUC issued letters to the operators informing them that the shared rides were not allowed by regulation. However, these services remain in operation.\n\nOne of the hopes for shared-use mobility is that it will reduce congestion and costly parking requirements. In 2013, San Jose, California amended its zoning ordinance to reduce minimum parking requirements from 15 to 50 percent for developments that are located near transit and include Travel Demand Management (TDM) measures. Qualified TDM programs include carpooling, vanpooling, onsite car share parking, transit passes, electric vehicle charging, alternative fuel vehicle priority parking, guaranteed ride home, telecommuting, parking cash out, education and programmatic support, emergency transportation, transit shuttles, and bicycle commuter facilities. This regulation is an example of the type of transit oriented development (TOD) zoning that is becoming more common in communities around the country.\n\nMore detailed information is available in SUMC's Shared Mobility Policy Database located online at SharedUseMobilityCenter.org\n\nPart VII \n\nAs new shared-use services proliferate in cities across the nation, one debate that has continued to surface is whether shared mobility is good or bad for public transit. With the rapid rise of disruptive technologies like ridesourcing, many people have questioned whether public transit will have to make significant changes to the way it operates. \n\nOn one hand, shared mobility may take riders off transit for some trips. On the other hand, by enabling people in more places to easily get around without owning a car, it may be creating an entirely new group of transit riders. Overall, it seems shared-use services have the potential to expand regional mobility and—in some casesprovide service with more flexibility and lower capital costs than traditional rail and bus. SUMC has interviewed local transportation officials from around the country to determine their level of interaction with shared-use modes and the possibilities for integration. The opinions many of these stakeholders shared are in line with the early evidence in this area, which suggests that shared-use mobility complements public transit. \n\nAccording to a 2014 study by Susan Shaheen and Elliot Martin, shared mobility services have helped to expand demand for public transit networks, especially in more dispersed communities and small to midsized cities without dense urban cores.32 For instance, the study found that 14 percent of Minneapolis bikeshare members increased rail use along the main commuter corridor as well as on the city's outer edge. A similar number reported increased bus use. In places where transit demand outpaces capacity (because of physical constraints, capital shortfalls, or both), shared-use services also work as a peak-hour pressure valve. Especially in bigger cities, the rush-hour downtown commute remains the largest service concern, and many agencies are already working at the limits of their capacity. By relieving some of this excess demand, shared-use modes can enable agencies to continue providing efficient service while slowing the need for capital expansions. Bikesharing, ridesourcing, and other shared modes can also provide feeder or first/last mile connections to transit trips. Mass transit is unsurpassed at bypassing congestion and efficiently moving a large number of people in and out of dense urban areas. Even if they have the resources, few users would likely want to swap a 15-mile train ride for a daily ridesourced trip in rush-hour traffic. It is easy to imagine additional benefits from integrating shared-use mobility and public transit. Breakthroughs in real-time mobile apps and dynamic routing and carpooling solutions developed by ridesourcing companies like Uber, Lyft and Bridj could lead to transit models that optimize resources and improve performance and efficiency, even in lower-density areas that are difficult to serve effectively with fixedroute transit. Shared mobility services can more nimbly coordinate with transit to provide additional transportation options, both at times of high demand and at night and on weekends, when transit service is less frequent and often uneconomical for agencies to provide.", "filename": "Reference-Guide-Editsweb-version-10.24.2016_1.md"}
{"doc_id": 375, "text": "Some agencies have begun to think about ways to connect with shared mobility providers. In early 2015, Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) and Uber launched a new partnership featuring linked mobile apps. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and many other agencies have also launched partnerships with carsharing providers such as Zipcar to locate vehicles at transit stops to provide better first/last mile connectivity. Additionally, public agencies have begun looking into ways they can use shared mobility to reinvent important but inefficient modes such as paratransit and dial-a-ride services. Transit agencies are also pursuing new information technologies that may help them integrate with other modes. The number of transit agencies providing usable data to Google for trip planning increased from six in 2006 to some 950 cities worldwide as of late 2015.33 In addition to Google Maps, more than 200 transit-planning applications now exist, ranging from applications focused on a single transit agency to applications that cover hundreds of cities across the world. Roughly two-thirds of all transit agencies now make information available to third-party developers for the creation of apps and other tools for transit users. 34 On the flipside, the massive new stores of transportation data that are being generated by shareduse technologies and network aggregators could help public agencies better envision and plan for new mobility patterns. Knowing in detail how intra-regional flows are growing and changing would be invaluable for both operational and long-term planning. At this point, much of the potential for transit agencies to integrate with or offer shared modes remains untapped. Most transit agencies see their role as managing publicly owned fleets of vehicles with fixed route local service. Some transit agencies describe their role as \"mobility managers,\" responsible for creating efficient, diverse and convenient urban mobility systems, but even these agencies are stymied by funding sources, procurement rules and other regulations that limit experimentation with new modes.35 James Corless, director of Transportation for America, says that the fundamental question for transit is: what is the role of a public transportation provider in \n\" What is the role of this new environment where multiple mobility public transportation in providers are responding more quickly to a changing market? 36 this new environment To be sure that they understand and make the most of these opportunities, transportation decision-makers need better data on the impact of shared mobility on public transit, travel behavior, and consumer preferences.

{"doc_id": 376, "text": "February 2022 Social benefits of shared mobility: metrics and methodologies 26th ACEA SAG REPORT\nProfessor Greg Marsden\n\nThe European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) has commissioned this 26th Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) report to examine the social impacts of shared mobility. Through reviewing existing studies and evaluation frameworks, the report provides clear recommendations on how to capture the social impacts of shared mobility and how this can be delivered through the collaboration of the various public and private actors in the system. This SAG report by Professor Greg Marsden (Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds) focuses on what is understood about the social benefits of newer forms of shared mobility such as pooled ride-hailing, e-scooters and carsharing. However, it does so from the perspective that these innovations are just a further part of the mobility eco-system. Their role and their impacts need to be understood alongside the existing mobility options such as bus and rail or active travel. Much sharing goes on informally, through family or social groups and often now organised via chat platforms such as WhatsApp. We know already that a large part of the population is multi-modal across the week and so these new options will most likely form part of a new blend of mobility for users. Sometimes new services will act as complements to and sometimes as competitors with existing modes. If new forms of shared mobility are to be treated fairly in terms of regulation and support then it is important to understand what role they fulfil.\n\nThere is also a huge diversity of shared mobility innovations being developed. Some are about sharing of assets such as cars, bikes or e-scooters which can be through private companies, local governments or peer to peer. Other sharing is about sharing on the go, such as demand responsive services, pooled ridehailing or liftsharing. That too can take diverse forms. In discussing the social impacts of shared mobility it is essential to recognise that this is not one thing - but many - and the purpose, target markets, barriers and use cases will potentially be quite different.\n\nShared mobility provides additional options into the transport mix for the areas in which they operate. There are four main ways in which shared mobility could impact on individuals:\n1. They can provide greater spatial accessibility for people who are within a reasonable walking distance of the system. They also offer the potential for first and last-mile trips which connect to mainline public transport services thus widening the spatial opportunities reachable within a reasonable time frame.\n\nTo understand how the individual potential impacts of shared mobility translate into social impacts it is necessary to examine impact pathways. Changes to the transport system mix result in changes to travel patterns which in turn produce both directly measurable and second order social impacts. An example of a direct benefit would be the greater temporal accessibility offered by subsidised ridehailing services. This might make people in a disadvantaged area report being more able to participate in jobs in the nighttime economy, which in turn reduces unemployment and improves standards of living for the most needy. Second order impacts are more complex to track but include how the wider system adapts as a result of changing travel patterns such as the growth of retail around mobility hubs or reductions in parking requirements for new development which lower housing costs.\n\nWhilst the review has identified a range of studies which suggest the potential for shared mobility to have positive social impacts, the evidence base is surprisingly weak. The majority of systems have not been designed to tackle specific social impacts or promote social goals and studies of impacts have only tangentially considered social impacts. Evidence is available on the profile of members and users, with new shared mobility services generally being more likely to be used by parts of the population who are male, younger than average and educated to university level. In general, the central areas of larger cities is where early market demand has been greatest and where supply has focussed. It should not be presumed that shared mobility services will deliver social benefits in the way that maximises public policy benefits. Indeed, one of the benefits of developing a better understanding of the impacts of shared mobility will be the ability to make more informed and proportionate regulatory interventions and to justify the targeting of subsidy to support outcomes which the market would not deliver by itself. \n\nThis review has not been able to establish a single source which provides a comprehensive and usable framework for the social impact assessment of shared mobility and this lack of coherence is perhaps a contributory factor to the weak evidence base. To help overcome the limited evidence base an indicator framework is proposed which directly connects to the impact pathways collecting data on:\n- Accessibility impacts;\n- Transport system impacts;\n- Wider impacts; and\n- Equity impacts, which include distributional concerns.", "filename": "Social_benefits_shared_mobility-26th_ACEA_SAG-report.md"}
{"doc_id": 377, "text": "There is little consensus across cities and between different research studies on how many indicators is enough or what the right indicators are (and this is true beyond social impact assessment). Even with some simplification 35 indicators were identified across six studies which could potentially be applied. There are other important areas such as the consumption of space and well-being that are yet to feature in the indicator sets. Four case studies are reviewed which have elements of a state-of-art or robust approach to evaluation. They demonstrate that social impact assessment requires an understanding of who is being served (and who is not) and whether the change in behaviour has unlocked \n\nThese are necessary to understand the role of new shared mobility services and to inform approaches to subsidy and regulation where this is important to steering different social outcomes to those which the market alone would provide.\n\nMore bespoke evaluations should aim to learn about where the balance of subsidy, risk and reward in seeking to roll out shared mobility services which work for everyone and deliver greater social benefits.\n3. Shared mobility providers and academics need to work to develop new metrics of multi-modal accessibility that allow joined up assessments of how users interact with an increasingly multi-modal set of options. This may also need to be extended to better understand how consumers use packages of services and how this impacts on their satisfaction.\n\nThe second set of recommendations is about harnessing the strength of different actors with respect to the data they bring, building on the approaches which are already in play in cities and companies.\n\nShared mobility is not new. Up until the 1960s across Europe bus and rail were used for the majority of miles travelled and remain the major forms of shared mobility. Even beyond the 1960s car ownership was relatively low and, whilst this continued to rise, a far greater percentage of car use was shared than is the case today, with average car ownership levels in Europe in 2020 at around 524 per 1000 population.1 Even today, most sharing is conducted peer to peer and through informal networks.2 However, there is a major revolution and a new suite of shared mobility options which are already impacting mobility patterns.\n\nThis paper will focus on what is understood about the social benefits of these newer forms of shared mobility such as pooled ride-hailing, e-scooters and carsharing. However, it does so from the perspective that these innovations are just a further part of the mobility eco-system. Their role and their impacts need to be understood alongside the existing mobility options such as bus and rail or active travel. A large part of the population is multi-modal across the week and so these new options will most likely form part of a new blend of mobility for users.3 Sometimes new services will act as complements to and sometimes as competitors with existing modes. If new forms of shared mobility are to be treated fairly in terms of regulation and support then it is important to understand what role they fulfil. The rise of car ownership has brought considerable individual benefits in terms of convenience. The opportunity to move people and goods over large differences to a range of destinations has been very important to economic growth in the last century, although these links are weakening.4 This individualised convenience has also brought with it significant social and environmental costs as well as rising congestion levels. It makes participation in society harder for many of those who do not have access to a car and is also wasteful of resources: \n- The average car is stationary for 95% of the day5;\n- The largest proportion of the car fleet moving at one point in time has been estimated as 14%6; \n- A third of all cars do not move at all on any given day6; and - The average occupancy of cars is around 1.2 for the peak and 1.6 overall7.\n\nThere is therefore a huge opportunity to provide the mobility needs of the population by \n\nMobility as a Service (MaaS) is another innovation which connects to the shared mobility system. Pangbourne et al. see MaaS as a system where \"users are purchasing mobility services via a broker (often termed a mobility operator) that provides an interface connected to multiple transport services.\" P38 14 MaaS itself does not provide any new mobility services, although it may enhance access to shared mobility resources by overcoming information \n\nShared mobility provides additional options into the transport mix for the areas in which they operate. There are four main ways in which shared mobility could impact on individuals18:", "filename": "Social_benefits_shared_mobility-26th_ACEA_SAG-report.md"}
{"doc_id": 378, "text": "Shared mobility services will have direct social impacts on users of the systems. An important question from a public policy perspective is who do these benefits fall to and who misses out? Distributional assessments of social impact focus on the difference in characteristics of either or both the areas served by shared mobility services and the characteristics of the users of the system.26 The distinction between access to and use of services is important. One could have proximity to shared mobility but not, for financial, physical or mental capabilities or cultural norms be able to use such a system. Much of the literature focusses on the differences between levels of uptake or membership or access on the basis of characteristics such as race, gender, employment status or income. Dill and McNeill (2020, p5) provide a review of the literature on equity and vehicle sharing.12 Their assessment of the evidence to date, at least in many developed countries, has found that these services are used disproportionately by more privileged populations, such as people with higher incomes and more education and people who are male, nondisabled, white and/or younger\". Martens (2016) argues that the accessibility gap between the best served in the population and the worst served should be limited.27 Within this though it is important to focus on providing a \"sufficient\" level of accessibility to a set of key services. In such a framing, so long as shared mobility services provided new accessibility opportunities to disadvantaged populations there may still be wider social policy benefits even if already well served areas \n\nCurl et al. (2020, p42), in a review of the social impact assessment of mode shift, argues that distributional analysis of accessibility should form \"part, but not all of a broader social impact assessment.\"18 They argue that \"social, economic and environmental impacts are connected in a complex system. Impact pathways need to be articulated and second and higher order, wider impacts, considered.\". So, for example, if ridehailing services add to accessibility for an area but result in the reduction of the viability and service frequency of public transport then this would need to be included in an impact assessment. They also note that social impact assessments would benefit significantly from engaging with the target communities rather than starting from traditional transport appraisal approaches which remain dominated by monetisable metrics such as travel time.\n\nAs it is important to distinguish between the provision of new shared mobility assets or services (access to) and the use of those services, the social impacts of shared mobility assets can only really be understood by tracking: how they are used; who is using them; whether what they are doing is new travel or transferred from other modes; and what it is enabling people to do. The process of understanding changing impacts is shown below in Figure 3. It is necessary to understand shared mobility services not just in terms of the performance of the specific service but in relation to other transport options. Cohen and Shaheen, for example, found that only about 9% of 6000 carpool riders in morning used the car pooling trip for the reverse trip in the evening, the remainder used public transportation.19 In Lyon, 9% of the population are members of the Velo'v system and so it forms just one part of the wider mobility ecosystem.28 Teixeira et al. reviewed the impacts of bike share schemes across 77 studies and made an assessment of the main benefits and the wider limitations and risks which can counter those benefits.29 They note that the benefits of such schemes are contingent on replacing trips by motorised modes. Health gains may not occur for all groups and this will depend on the wider transport safety and air quality context. Whilst the systems seem to offer the theoretical potential to decrease the accessibility gap between car-owning and car-less groups socially disadvantaged groups are systematically underrepresented in the use of the systems. \n\nWhilst on one level, the provision of additional shared mobility services, which make efficient use of assets, feels intuitively likely to generate positive social impacts there are very few simple cause and effect relationships. The next section addresses how to establish a framework to connect shared mobility to social impacts. \n\nThis report focuses on social benefits and impacts of shared mobility. It is, of course, impossible to separate out social, environmental and economic impacts in real life as they are mutually connected through the changes to patterns of use. This section begins by setting out the principles of indicator frameworks for assessing impacts before focussing more specifically on the social impacts which are the focus of this report.\n\nThere are two core concerns in assembling an indicator framework: 1. The establishment of a clear set of outcomes or policy goals which the indicators are to inform", "filename": "Social_benefits_shared_mobility-26th_ACEA_SAG-report.md"}
{"doc_id": 379, "text": "Different policy goals or outcomes have priority in different places and these can change over time. For example, currently in Sweden the 17 United Nations sustainable development goals30 are shaping the selection of outcomes. In the UK, there has been a shift from very tightly specified key outcomes around a range of policy objectives connected to safety, air quality, congestion and inclusion to no central guidance31, although this is moving again with requirements for climate targets. It is not possible here to specify the 'outcomes', but, in any indicator framework, it should be known why something is being monitoring something and what it contributes towards.\n\nThe second concern relates to the mechanics of assembling an indicator framework. This involves finding the right balance of comprehensive and simple to understand but, importantly, it must also connect what is measured to the outcomes through reasonable impact pathways as set out in Section 2. There should not be indicators in a framework that do not serve a purpose or have clear ownership. Many different guides to assembling indicator frameworks have been developed and interested parties can find further details in the reference list at the end of the document32. \n\nThe review has not been able to establish a single source which provides a comprehensive and usable framework for social impact assessment. All studies which examine shared mobility in some way have something to contribute in that they utilise some metrics to demonstrate the impacts or, if modelled, the potential impacts of the innovation in question. \n\nSome 35 different indicator topic areas are identified across the studies (even after allowing \n\nIn order to connect the policy outcomes to the range of potential indicators then the impact chain is organised as set out in Figure 3. This focuses on what is changed in the transport options for the users, then it examines how this impacts on patterns of mobility and, from that, what the net social impacts are. It is also essential to consider how these impacts are distributed across the population. Each of these elements are treated in turn below.\n\nThese are metrics which set out what is available and what, in theory, this provides access to. Variables to be measured include the locations of stations/pick up points, service hours, average waiting times and service costs. There are two aspects to consider. First is access to the assets themselves - how long does it take someone to reach a carshare vehicle or to receive a ridehail to their address. The second measure would then to be to convert this knowledge into a measure of potential accessibility to key services such as employment sites, hospitals or education centres. Such calculations can be complex to produce and require integrating shared mobility services with existing public transport assets and other shared services if there is a prospect of first-mile last-mile connectivity and a belief that multimodality will be important (eg with Mobility as a Service applications). Significant consideration of how these systems might be connected can be found through the extensive modelling exercise on shared mobility developed by the International Transport Forum9 although further work is still needed. \n\nWhilst shared mobility innovations provide the potential for new travel options to be adopted through accessibility gains, it is only in the actual choices which are made that the combination of individual capacity to use the system (financial resources, physical capacity etc.) combined with the relative convenience of the system for the journeys that need to be made are revealed. Even those who engage with a system by signing up for membership may not become regular users. In order to track the social impacts of shared mobility services it is essential to know how important they are in the overall mobility mix and, as discussed further in 3.2.4, to know for whom and for what kinds of journeys.\n\nIf one assumes that the rest of the transport system remains unaltered by the introduction of new shared mobility options (for example bus service levels remain unchanged) then, any increase in shared mobility service use can be seen as a proxy for some form of social benefit. This is because it either represents an entirely new trip which had not previously been made or it represents a shift from a previous way of travelling to a new way which, by definition, has been selected because the user finds it in some way preferable. Whilst this is a fairly narrow and utilitarian view of the social benefits of shared mobility it is nonetheless an important foundation for wider benefits which are claimed as a result. The metrics which are used to capture travel behaviour are those which have commonly been in use in the transport sector for decades such as mode share, journey time, number of trips and costs of travel. Because of the interest in shared mobility unlocking new more intensive use of vehicles or the potential for people to shift to accessing cars on-demand rather than through ownership it is increasingly of interest to track impacts of shared mobility on levels of vehicle occupancy and on car ownership. Further extensions to understand the well-being impacts of different options would require more bespoke surveying of users36. ", "filename": "Social_benefits_shared_mobility-26th_ACEA_SAG-report.md"}
{"doc_id": 380, "text": "These outcomes will in any case change year on year as a result of new vehicles, design changes, the introduction of cycling infrastructure or road redesign etc. For shared mobility services to have an observable impact on these outcomes the interventions would need to be the dominant influence and so some of these impacts are inferred from changing usage \n\nThere are also some direct and second order impacts on land-use. Direct impacts might be on improving (or worsening) the local environment through the provision of new mobility assets which change the consumption of space. This could depend on the design of the parking areas and whether these improve the pedestrian environment or encroach upon it, for example. Second order impacts might be from local authorities deciding to reduce parking provision in central areas or for new residencies as more people choose to reduce or eliminate car ownership. This land can then be given over to other uses which can, for example, make housing more affordable.38 3.3.4 Distributional concerns Dill and McNeil (2020)'s review of the distributional impacts of carshare, bikeshare and escooters looked across different groups according to race/ethnicity, income, gender, age and disability.12 There are some frequently observed findings which suggest that attention needs to be paid to distributional impacts based on the characteristics of the early adoption of shared mobility services. For example, women are less likely to be members of carshare and bikeshare and, early evidence would suggest with e-scooters. Carsharing tends to attract wealthier and more highly educated groups and, whilst bike share schemes are also typically used by higher income people, this is perhaps the result of better spatial access to stations for these groups in privately run systems. Older people are somewhat less likely to engage in carshare schemes but more so with bikeshare and e-scooters which have a much younger demographic. Dill and McNeil \"did not find any research that provided data on the use of carshare, bikeshare or shared e-scooters by people with disabilities.\"12 Different cities have different economic and spatial geographies which dictate where higher and lower income groups are located and the degree of concentration of different ethnic groups. The evidence base to date suggests that whilst there might be some shared factors across places, the most important implication is that the impacts of shared mobility are not falling evenly across society. In addition, it appears that unless they are designed to specifically tackle pre-existing distributional issues there is a risk that they will widen gaps. \n\nAssessing the distribution of impacts across different groups is therefore crucial to any claims to be making the transport system more inclusive and fair.\n\nThis section briefly reviews four case studies from the literature which provide insights into how to operationalise a framework for assessing social impacts. The four case studies were selected to cover a range of social impacts and methodological approaches which, together, enable some more robust conclusions to be drawn about the relationship between different actors around data sharing. The case studies are not intended to point to 'good implementation practice' or to be the most contemporary studies. It is their peer reviewed \n\nPalm et al. (2021) review a range of different types of integration between new mobility services and traditional public transport in order to address social equity problems.21 38 agencies had provided some form of subsidy to ridehailing services. Greater Philideplhia, for example, subsidised 40% of Uber ride costs to access suburban public transport stops to widen the reach of public transport. Whilst 36 of the 38 agencies said they were subsidising ride hailing for benefit of low income, only one scheme in Tampa was clearly equity focused\n(subsidising between 9pm and 6am up to 23 rides per month for those at or below 150% of US poverty line). For the remainder \"equity remained outside of scope…\" (p36) according to the authors. No evidence was found that access for digitally disconnected people or those who are unbanked was addressed.\n\nA second set of case studies focused on the use of Demand Responsive Transit services to extend the hours or spatial coverage of public transport. A rural scheme in Scotland was estimated to provide a benefit to cost ratio of 3:1 as a result of people who would not have been able to access jobs being able to do so. In Belleville, Ontario, a demand responsive night bus service replaced a traditional service and reported a 300% increase in ridership. \n\nThe evaluation measured riders sense of well-being, safety and ability to reach activities at night. 40% of respondents reporting that they felt that this enabled them to work nights.

{"doc_id": 381, "text": "However, examples from San Francisco and Finland also showed declines in patronage, although there was no assessment provided of the counterfactual position and whether the outcomes were better than they otherwise might have been. The authors suggest the need for a standardised data protocol which sets out waiting times, deviation times and travel times to provide ways of comparing accessibility with more traditional public transport and also so that multi-modal accessibility can be assessed. \n\nHowever, they also point to the need to focus on how these schemes impact on actual activity participation through surveys. They conclude that whilst demand responsive transport and ride-hailing have \"the potential to meaningfully address some disadvantaged traveller's transportation problems\" they \"find little rigorous evaluation of this potential.\" (p41)\n\nEckhardt et al. report on trials of MaaS in three smaller rural areas/cities in Finland Porvoo, Ylöjärvi and Sastamala.22 Rural MaaS, in the contexts studied, is more about combining different services into a package to provide a wider suite of options rather than providing integration between services as was the case in Section 4.1. Rural MaaS includes Demand Responsive Transit, liftsharing and shared services (eg using health and social care transport). It is believed that rural MaaS can have a positive impact on accessibility and total travel cost/individual or household as well as providing savings to the service providers. \n\nHowever, the trials are very clear. They operate in an environment where all services are \n\nIt is important to note that the nature of the cases are of greater value than the outcomes, given the very limited sample of people interviewed or surveyed. In case 1, a late night DRT was created as there was no pre-existing public transport service. 10 people (of the 15 surveyed) reported using the service for leisure and 5 for school/work trips. The study identified high levels of car ownership per household on average and informal lift giving as a key alternative, with the service being used where this was not available. In case 2 an existing taxi-based social mobility service was reconfigured with a minibus or taxi now all coordinated through one call centre. The evaluation was again limited and skewed to older females (76 years). 27% of users said they would not have made the trip without the service and some shifts in preference for how to make trips were observed. 80% of people said they used the service because the family car was not available. In the second of the two cases, the system was replacing a pre-existing set of arrangements and so a direct before and after assessment can be made which could include the number and nature of users, the frequency and timing of trips as well as their purpose. It is particularly important with services which have few alternatives to measure quality attributes such as waiting times, how far in advance booking is required and on-vehicle journey times as the user may have just two choices which are to use or stay at home and so identifying preferences is difficult.\n\nRaux et al. conducted an evaluation of who is using the Velo'v bikesharing scheme in Lyon and how it had affected their travel patterns.28 Velo'v began in 2003 and, at the time of the research study in 2014, had 350 stations, 4500 bikes and 50,000 members (which equates to 9% of the population of Lyon/Villeurbanne). The study focuses on annual season ticket holders which costed €25 for adults and €15 for students. More than two-thirds of system users are season ticket holders.\n\nStation supply is correlated with population density and the density of stops is significantly associated with the likelihood of being a season ticket holder. Station supply is not correlated with the wealth of an area as many factors impact on population density. Despite an apparently equitable distribution of supply, annual members were found to be more likely to be male, under 30, holders of public transport season tickets and a driving license. Higher social position and residential proximity to a station both have separate positive effects on the likelihood of being a member of Velo'v. Velo'v is used for a variety of journey purposes like other modes. 17% of respondents used Velo'v extensively - with the remainder using it as a more occasional mode (on average less than 3 times per week). Both Velo'v and public transport appear as a substitute to car or walk suggesting the need to take a rounded view as to the mobility impacts of the system. The study is an example of a careful comparison of the characteristics of scheme users with a wider household travel study which was available for the two areas. The study was not specifically focused on equity impacts but it was able to look at gender and occupation/employment status as well as the types of activities that it was used for. No information on what new opportunities were opened up was obtained as the survey focused", "filename": "Social_benefits_shared_mobility-26th_ACEA_SAG-report.md"}
{"doc_id": 382, "text": "Becker et al. 2017 compared users of free-floating carshare and station-based carshare in Basel Switzerland.39 The scheme was more focussed on user profiles for the two schemes rather than questions of spatial equity as the distance to the nearest station-based scheme was only around 300m.\n\nThe study, as with that on Velo'v made a comparison of behaviour between users of the two systems and the wider population of the study area. The study was able to report on differences in patterns based on gender, age, education, license holding and car ownership. For example, 70% of free-floating members are male, 60% for station based compared with 55% for license holders in the general population. Over half of free-floating members were under 36 and this was significantly younger than either station-based users or the general population. Examination of journey purpose showed the station-based systems being used more for goods transport and leisure than the free-floating, whereas the free-floating was used significantly more for commuting. The average occupancy of station based was significantly higher than free-floating (1.8 compared to 1.4).\n\nThe two different systems also exhibited very different levels of competition/complementarity with public transport, walking and cycling. The net percentage of people using bus more rather than less was +13% for station-based users and -9% for free-floating users. The parallel figures for walking were +8% and -16%. \n\nThis study is important in that it underlines the fact that the impacts of carsharing can only really be understood by relating the characteristics of users to the general population and by understanding the detail of what the journeys are for and what they are replacing. It is not however, recommended to extrapolate these results beyond the specific case at the point of assessment.\n\nThis section looks at the methodological lessons relating to the four different elements of the indicator framework set out in Section 3. First, for accessibility indicators it is important for service providers to consider how best to integrate their services with the existing approach to accessibility assessment in an area. For example, some countries have a defined spot location of every public transport stop and regularly update their public transport schedules which are assigned to each stop. This allows a level of service accessibility to be generated to anywhere in the city. Some shared mobility schemes operate on a station-based structure and can mirror the public transport service data by profiling availability of mobility assets, for example. For other services where the service is flexible then having a network of pick up points with expected wait times would be necessary. As Palm et al. set out, this is an area which would benefit from further \n\nFundamentally, the achievement of better social outcomes requires understanding a whole range of system properties, travel behaviours and outcomes which no one organisation has access to. Mobility providers have fantastic knowledge about who is using their system, how often, for how long and when and where they go when they do. However, without the rounded perspective of local authorities who are trying to build a whole area understanding of mobility it is difficult to infer the social impacts. Whilst there are increasingly intelligent and blended ways for local government to understand travel patterns in real-time40 it is through more effective partnership working and data sharing that a better understanding of social impacts will be achieved and this forms part of the recommendations in Section 5.\n\nAs Curl et al. (2020, p8) state \"the range of interconnected social impacts, with different timeframes and pathways can make it difficult to measure the social impacts of transport policies and to attribute outcomes to specific policies.\"18 There are three aspects to consider for assessing wider social impact outcomes. For some of impacts, it will be necessary to conduct bespoke evaluations. As the first two cases showed, these are most likely to be measured through questionnaires or interviews which seek to capture information on a specific social impact which the system was targeted at (such as participation in the nighttime economy) or through asking about feelings of social cohesion. Evaluations typically rely on asking what users would have done without the service unless a careful before and after survey approach has been planned. It may be possible to compare with areas where there is no provision to look at differences in responses with and without the system.

{"doc_id": 383, "text": "Distributional analysis shows the importance of thinking about the difference between members, member-users and casual users of systems as they have different characteristics. It is important to control for the impacts of proximity to services in assessing the propensity to use such systems. However, even in those locations with fairly ubiquitous coverage, there are important differences in the profile of users from the general population. Most of the evidence to date has focused on income (or sometimes education as a proxy), age and gender. A number of studies have looked at race or ethnicity but there is less coverage of disability. Shared mobility services generally have a good understanding of the profiles of their members and this could help more generally to improve the treatment of distributional issues within transport planning analysis practices.\n\nWhilst the potential for shared mobility to deliver social benefits is clear, the evidence base is relatively weak and, because of the nature of early scheme deployments, has more substantially benefitted those who already had multiple mobility options. This of course has a social value but, for some of the wider claims about social benefits to be recognised requires a better evidence base. In order to do this, some deliberate actions have to be taken. \n\nThe first three recommendations are targeted to ensure that an understanding is built around how shared mobility systems can be integrated into the existing mobility eco-system and deliver social benefits. It is from this understanding that better regulatory interventions and effective, transparent and fair subsidy arrangements can be developed such that the social benefits are steered in ways which best meet the policy objectives.\n\nThe second set of recommendations relates to finding ways of harnessing the strength of different actors with respect to the data they bring. There are ways to move beyond the reticence to share data at a micro scale for fear of data protection breaches by all parties being clear about what is needed and why. Much can be done without needing micro-level data.\n\nNone of this is to diminish the huge advances in demand forecasting and use pattern analysis which big data brings. Some of the insights available from big data which new mobility service providers have brought, and which local authorities and public transport operators are also now increasingly deploying are invaluable. However, McKenney argues that from a social equity perspective \"machine learning could very easily perpetuate any equity blind assumptions that existed\"41. To understand social impacts requires a full understanding of who is not accessing as well as who is, and this requires a broader approach than just user data. The recommendations are quite deliberately collaborative in their nature. Local governments are responsible for trying to steer improved social outcomes but have limited influence on the provision of shared mobility services. Shared mobility service providers can deliver improved social outcomes but do not have a responsibility to identify what needs addressing or for subsidising provision where this is required (although they may sometimes do so). It appears that only through more collaborative working will the full range of social benefits of shared mobility be within reach.", "filename": "Social_benefits_shared_mobility-26th_ACEA_SAG-report.md"}

This led to the emergence of the Smart Mobility concept, attracting significant attention from major actors in the mobility sector including policy makers and traffic authorities. Therefore, this survey paper presents an overview of Smart Mobility and discusses the main challenges associated with its key building blocks, parking and traffic management, traffic routing in addition to emissions and road safety implications. Then, the most important works that attempted to address these challenges are presented, and their strengths and limitations are analysed. Finally, the lessons learned from this study and the most promising future directions to tackle these challenges are presented.\n\nSmart Mobility, Smart Cities, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Traffic Management System.\n\nMoreover, several issues related to the use of these technologies need to be solved to ensure their wide acceptance by cities inhabitants. Among these issues, privacy is a major concern as if it is not protected properly it can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information about individuals such as their health status, tracking their mobility, etc. Another major concern is the fear of cyber-attacks targeting interconnected networks of heterogeneous devices or vehicles, which may lead to devastating consequences, e.g.\n\nBy 2050, cities will be home for more than two-thirds of the world population Dameri (2014). Although people can buy, search, learn, book their trips online and settle their affairs using Internet facilities, they still need to go to work, school, hospitals and travel; in other words \"they must move\". Their mobility, using public transport or private cars, generates traffic flow, congestion and air pollution and puts more stress on the available road infrastructure. That is why Smart Mobility (S-Mobility) has emerged as a revolution in the transport sector handling the associated challenges with individuals mobility in Smart Cities in a more efficient way. S-Mobility does not focus on completely building a new infrastructure due to the colossal cost needed and other difficulties, but rather on optimizing the existing infrastructure through the use of Information and Communications Technology\n(ICT) in a smart way Suske, Tcheumadjeu, Calvin, Sohr, and Xiaoxu (2016). S-Mobility is one of the main building blocks of Smart Cities development because many other services depend on its level of efficiency and robustness.\n\nThe successful implementation of S-Mobility will make the commuter's journey faster, cheaper, more comfortable and safer.\n\nThis survey presents a comprehensive analysis of SMobility challenges in the emerging era of Smart Cities, highlights and discusses the most important recent advances in S-Mobility and provides suggestions for future directions. Although a few other surveys addressed several challenges in Smart Mobility, such as Benevolo, Dameri, and D Auria (2016) which focuses on highlighting the role of ICTs in supporting S-Mobility actions and improving the quality of life in the city, none of them has provided a deep analysis and covered the aspects of SMobility discussed in this survey. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that drew a road-map to assist researchers and traffic managers in efficiently dealing with S-Mobility challenges and thus paving the way to its successful implementation.\n\nThe main contributions of this survey can be further summarized as follows:\n\nAs places of opportunities where everything is available such as jobs, good schools, hospitals, shopping centers, entertainment services, etc., cities have attracted more and more population during the last few decades Arasteh et al. (2016). This has led to an increased air pollution, traffic congestion and noise, especially in big urban areas. However, the fast expansion of ICT based solutions adoption and IoT sensors deployment in several application domains have assisted these cities to become more intelligent and comfortable for living. In the following, we present the most common definitions of Smart Cities, their categories and dimensions. Then, we provide an overview of the most important dimension, that is S-Mobility.\n\nAccording to Benevolo et al. (2016), a city is considered\n\"Smart\" if it is a prosperous city in competitiveness, social and human capital, governance, mobility, natural resources preservation, and quality of life, in addition to its reliance \"on the smart combination of activities of selfdecisive, independent and aware citizens\" Dimitrakopoulos (2017).", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}

These two platforms are combined in Santana, Chaves, Gerosa, Kon, and Milojicic (2018)\nto provide a Unified Reference Architecture. A web platform called \"E-City\" is also developed in Amado, Poggi, Ribeiro Amado, and Breu (2018) and made accessible to planners, stakeholders, and population with the aim to provide them with more insights on energy consumption in different urban areas.\n\nFigure 1. **A Smart City model**\n\nThe components of a Smart City model are often grouped into six dimensions Housing and OTB (2018) (see Figure 1): smart environment, smart economy, smart government, smart people, smart living and S-Mobility. This model is adopted by many works in the literature such as Moustaka, Vakali, and Anthopoulos (2017), Letaifa\n(2015), Pellicer et al. (2013), Moustaka, Vakali, and Anthopoulos (2018), and Housing and OTB (2018). This inspired us to organize the objectives (or the challenges to overcome) of Smart Cities according to the above six components and for each of them we briefly explain how they address one or more of these challenges.\n\nMany challenges arise from this dimension, such as, how to satisfy users demand by ensuring comfortable journeys and minimizing trips duration without causing any delay to transport companies and preserving the environment. Several studies have developed different solutions for improving the mobility in cities to reduce traffic congestion and minimize its resulting impact on commuters, environment and the economy. Examples of these solutions include electric cars by Google Car 4, smart velomobility Behrendt (2016), smart parking Pala and Inanc\n(2007), a traffic information system such as REMON\nREMON (n.d.), bus and train scheduling J. Li (2002),\nAntsfeld and Walsh (2012). Companies and research centers like Hitachi Okuda, Hirasawa, Matsukuma, Fukumoto, and Shimura (2012), Fujitsu Kawasaki\n(2015) and German Aerospace Center (DLR) Suske et al. (2016) also developed several solutions in this field. Some governments have adopted new strategies to achieve S-Mobility like the Danish government 5that has encouraged the citizens to use bikes.\n\nAccording to Moustaka et al. (2018), S-Mobility is the most investigated dimension of Smart Cities in the literature. It is the most important and crucial component of a Smart City, because it influences all the other dimensions. That is why we are focusing on S-Mobility in this paper.\n\nIn other words, techno-centric focuses on hardware and consumer-centric on people who are a crucial element to enable S-Mobility. Figure 2 illustrates the main objectives of S-Mobility in Smart Cities.\n\nS-Mobility's main objectives are summarized in the following six points Benevolo et al. (2016):\n1. Reducing air pollution through minimizing the number of vehicles on roads and encouraging people to use Eco-friendly means of transport.\n\nWe summarize these challenges in the following five research questions: 1) How to effectively detect parking spots occupancy in order to minimize the search time for a free spot and its associated cost? 2) How to efficiently manage road traffic (estimation and prediction of traffic)\nto reduce travel time and cost and make travellers' journey more comfortable? 3) How to provide users with the optimal route to reach their destination within the desired time and other additional constraints, if any? 4) How to satisfy users' demand with minimum (or no) impact on the environment in terms of air and noise pollution? and finally 5) How to make our roads safer in the S-Mobility era? Despite the ongoing efforts in developing efficient solutions to face the above challenges, mobility in cities is still suffering from a lot of problems and no solution, to the best of our knowledge, has satisfactory covered the previous five questions. The objective of this survey is, therefore, to answer the above-mentioned research questions.", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}
{"doc_id": 386, "text": "In this section, we summarize the main challenges facing S-Mobility. These challenges could be classified into the following categories to ease the understanding of their nature and difficulty level: parking management, traffic management, traffic routing, air pollution and road safety related challenges (see Figure. 3). The relationship between these challenges can be explained as follows. Parking management system supports traffic flow management by reducing traffic congestion. An efficient parking management system will enable a reduction in the time spent by drivers searching for a free parking spot. Parking management systems can also support traffic routing systems through efficient coordination between them; if a traffic routing system is made aware of the availability of parking spots at the different car parks managed by a given parking management system, it can more efficiently route traffic in a way that reduces travel time for drivers, achieves better load balancing and maximizes the usage of car parks capacity. Traffic routing systems and traffic flow management systems support each other because the former can help in reducing the creation of traffic bottlenecks through load balancing. The latter can enable more efficient routing by providing accurate traffic flow estimation and evolution prediction. An innovative design and efficient operation of the above three systems will enable significant reduction in air pollution. Finally, efficient traffic flow management can significantly reduce traffic congestion and thus driving becomes safer. \n\nDespite the recent innovation in transport, the efficient management of on-street and off-street parking spots has not seen significant advancement in the way the availability of such spots is advertised to drivers, and the tools made available to enable efficient and easy parking P. M. et al. (2019). The inefficiency of current parking management systems is highlighted often, as drivers spend significant time searching for free spots; even though on average only around 80% of spots are occupied according to Research (2013). A study conducted by INRIX revealed that the average UK driver spends around 44 hours a year searching for parking, equating to £733, totalling £23.3 billion for the country INRIX (2017). This study highlighted as well that London was the worst city to park in, with an annual search time of 67 hours or 12 minutes per journey. Moreover, as stated by Admiral; 64% of drivers feel very stressed and anxious when they search for a free parking spot, and 71% complained about the limited number of available parking spaces Frampton\n(2017). Another study has shown that we waste an average of 17 hours a year looking for a place to park 6.\n\nThis wasted time due to parking management inefficiency or insufficient number of parking spots contributes significantly to the increased traffic congestion in cities, as stated in Nawaz, Efstratiou, and Mascolo (2013), as well as the increased greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, innovative solutions are needed to optimize the parking search time (for both on-street and off-street parking), reduce the parking cost and avoid creating bottlenecks nearby popular landmarks and key locations in the city. To achieve this aim, the real-time parking spots occupancy detection is compulsory along with the awareness of the nearest path to the parking spot location and the price to park. In the present survey, we focus on investigating parking space occupancy detection issues and propose novel classification of the existing works.\n\nIn Lin, Rivano, and Le Mouël (2017), the authors classified parking management solutions into three categories based on the target objective: information collection, system deployment and service dissemination. Enríquez, So6https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/07/12/parkingpain-causes-financial-and-personal-strain/467637001/\nria, Álvarez-García, Velasco, and Déniz (2017) leveraged the technology used as source for parking spots occupancy detection to classify the proposed solutions into three classes: infrastructure based solutions where sensor devices are the main source of information, crowd-sourcing based solutions that rely on drivers smartphones input, and hybrid solutions that combine both of the above. In this survey, we propose to classify the techniques used for parking spots vacancy detection in smart parking into the following four categories: computer vision enabled techniques, sensing technologies enabled techniques, probabilistic models enabled techniques and crowd-sensing enabled techniques as illustrated in Figure 4.\n\nIn this category, image processing techniques are used to process the data gathered by the cameras to detect the parking spots occupancy. As in Kianpisheh, Mustaffa, Limtrairut, and Keikhosrokiani (2012), we can identify two sub-categories of solutions: the first one counts the number of vehicles entering or exiting the parking without any indicator on the exact location of the vacant spots, while the second captures the exact location of the available spots.", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}
{"doc_id": 387, "text": "Image processing was used in Pushkar Modi (May 2011), where an automated truck stop management system was developed. This system informs trucks' drivers about the vacant spots and then directs them via a variable message display placed 30 or 40 miles before a stop signal. The proposed system was tested on a sample of videos and the results were promising. Some practical deployment challenges that may reduce the trustworthiness of such a system by its potential users were detected and solved.\n\nExamples of such challenges include the occurrence of errors when people cross a parking spot. This problem was solved by introducing a blob tracking to identify moving objects (i.e., people), which has significantly improved the results.\n\nThe authors in Goumiri, Benboudjema, and Pieczynski\n(2021) proposed a method to detect parking spots' occupancy by processing images collected from videos using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), see LeCun, Bottou, Bengio, and Haffner (1998). The idea consists of using the images collected by the available CCTV cameras. The proposed model is combined by one convolutional layer hence the name 1Conv. The obtained results highlighted that by using the 1Conv model, 99.84% of accuracy can be achieved , while the mAlexNet network, see Amato et al. (2017), can lead to 98.07% of using the PKLot7 dataset. The 1Conv model is two times faster than the mAlexNet.\n\nIn L.-C. Chen, Sheu, Peng, Wu, and Tseng (2020), Chen et al. proposed a method to detect parking spaces. This method uses street light control in where the lights are turned off when there is no vehicle in the street and vice versa. This system was implemented using the Jetson TX2 module, YOLO v3, and MobileNet v2. Experiments were done using the CNRPARK+EXT8 dataset and another set of images collected with a camera. The advantages of this system are: reducing costs compared to sensor-based methods, optimizing the use of lighting by turning it on and off when needed, and finding out how many parking spaces are available. To evaluate the performance of this system two metrics are used: accuracy and recall. The accuracy of this solution is 99%, while the recall is 95%.\n\nYOLO v5 is used in Rafique, Gul, Jan, and Khan (2023) to detect car rather than classify parking spaces into free or occupied.\n\nIn Goumiri, Benboudjema, and Hakimi (2022), Goumiri et al. used Decision Tree Regressor (DT) to estimate the number of available places in the upcoming time. The DT hyper-parameters were tuned on two public datasets, CNRPARK9and KLCC10. The authors transform the CNRPARK dataset of parking images to a dataset adopted for a regression problem. The proposed solution was compared to Random Forest Regression (RF) using MSE, MAE,\nRMSE, and R\n2 metrics. The study reveals that the DT proposed gives more accurate results than RF from small and large datasets.\n\nUsually, computer vision based methods have a very high scalability and reliability levels but at the expense of the achieved accuracy, as stated in Fraifer and Fernström\n(2016). The accuracy of such methods in outdoor parking systems can be affected significantly by bad weather conditions as the captured blurry images can lead to inaccurate results Kianpisheh et al. (2012). Therefore, there is a need to develop a universal method more resilient to weather conditions as well as other factors that may affect the accuracy of parking spots occupancy Yang and Pun-Cheng (2018).\n\nThese techniques use diverse sensor devices to detect the occupancy of parking spots and can be intrusive or *nonintrusive*. Intrusive techniques require excavate holes to host the sensors which include active infrared sensors, inductive loops, magnetometers, magneto-resistive sensors, pneumatic road tubes, piezoelectric cables and weigh-inmotion sensors. Inductive loop detectors 11, for example, are placed in the entrance of parking to count the number of entering and exiting vehicles; then this number is compared to the total parking capacity to determine the number of available spots. The Magnetometer is another example of sensors in this category and it mainly relies on the measurement of the earth's magnetic field disturbances caused by a vehicle.\n\nIts main advantages are its easy installation, low cost and small size. However, the accuracy of Magnetometer is reduced in most cases due to several factors including derivative magnetic field, overlap of close ferromagnetic objects and the variation of cars' manufacturing material Bao et al.

{"doc_id": 388, "text": "In Moura and Sussner (2018), a fuzzy approach was proposed to detect spot vacancy using anisotropic magnetoresistive sensor (AMR). This sensor is mainly adopted for wide parking areas like shopping malls and airports. The proposed method identifies as an output three states of a spot: occupied, free or *in transition* which means there is a vehicle entering or leaving the spot. The authors take into consideration a sliding window centered on the considered spot. To evaluate the solution two parameters are used: *variance* and *difference*. The former mean the variance in the present window. It takes its value in one of the two fuzzy sets, big or *small*. The latter, however, represents the difference between the average in the current window and the smallest average in a window before the appearance of a large variance. It is determined manually and can be positive or *negative*.\n\nIn Bao et al. (2017), Dual microwave Doppler radar transceiver modules were used to detect vacant spots and have been found to achieve an accuracy higher than 98%. RFID was also used in Someswar, Dayananda, Anupama, Priyadarshini, and Shariff (2017) with other technologies to develop an autonomic integrated car parking system. In Roman, Liao, Ball, Ou, and de Heaver (2018), an ultrasonic rangefinder was placed in vehicles' passenger seat side to measure the distance to a roadside obstacles.\n\nThen, a supervised machine learning algorithm is used to extract features of parked cars.\n\nIn Landry and Morin (2013), a probabilistic distribution was used to model the occupancy of parking spots. Initially, Bernoulli distribution was used to identify whether a given spot is free or not. In addition, the Gaussian distribution was used to model the spacial distribution of spots.\n\nThe temporal distribution was chosen in regard to parking of interest because it depends on the behavior of people using that parking. Subsequently, the two distributions spacial and temporal are joined. The main objective of this work is to estimate the expected waiting time for a spot to be released.\n\nThe results show that the multilayer perceptrons are the most adopted model for forecasting areas in 30 minutes horizons. While the Weibull regression model gives the most accurate results when estimating the likelihood that a parking place will remain vacant in the next period.\n\nUnlike the two previous works (i.e. Landry and Morin (2013) and Quinn (2008)), that predict the status of a given spot in the future, the solution proposed in Fabian\n(2013) predicts the probability of the presence of a vehicle in a given spot. This solution trained existing images, related to spot geometry and usual vehicle form, to identify parking spots status. In order to optimize the training phase, a probabilistic 3D car model was proposed. The reliability of this solution was tested under different degrees of illumination. The results show a worst case accuracy of up to 96.4%.\n\nThe requirement of prior knowledge of the probability distribution Moura and Sussner (2018) is the main limitation of this category of solutions because it is difficult to accurately determine, in advance, how long a vehicle will occupy a given parking spot, which makes them unsuitable solutions.\n\nIn X. Chen and Liu (2016), the authors describe a crowdsensing based system that helps drivers in finding free parking slots and guide each of them towards a suitable spot. This system consists of a central server, *client devices* and *smartparkers*. Three types of drivers are considered in this sytem: *smartparkers* who contribute to the system, *free riders* who use the system without sharing any information with it, and finally *ordinary riders* who are independent and do not interact with the system in any way. The system distinguishes three states of a given spot: occupied, free or *unknown*. The system annotates all streets by their parking availability and displays such information on a map. Drivers are informed about available free spots when they submit a request for a parking spot. If the indicated spot is found occupied, the driver reports this information to the server which in turn updates its database. Then, it guides the driver to another free spot (ideally, the closest one to its current location)\nto minimize cruising time. This process is called coordinate crowd-sensing and its main advantage consists in enabling the system to explore unknown areas. To investigate the performance of the proposed approach, two metrics were used: *average walking time* and average cruising time. Simulation results have shown that 12% of contribution by drivers give acceptable quality of service, whereas free riders can degrade significantly the quality of the service. Another guidance system is proposed in Chai, Ma, and Zhang (2019).", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}

In Shoup (2006) Shoup *et al*. have explained how to choose between cruising for curb parking or pay for off-street parking. This technique suffers from free-riders X. Chen, Santos-Neto, and Ripeanu (2012) and selfish liars as stated in Kokolaki, Kollias, Papadaki, Karaliopoulos, and Stavrakakis (2013) and Kokolaki, Karaliopoulos, Kollias, Papadaki, and Stavrakakis (2014).\n\nExamples of existing parking solutions include ParkSense 12 and BePark 13.\n\nRoad traffic congestion caused by the increasing number of vehicles using the limited and often deteriorated road infrastructure costs a significant loss of productivity for the society due to its resulting increase in journey times, air pollution and drivers' anxiety. Compared to traveling at a constant speed in free flow traffic, traffic congestion increases CO2 emissions as well as fuel consumption Barth and Boriboonsomsin (2008) due to Stop-and-go driving.\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most important causes of greenhouse gases that must be controlled to maintain a healthy environment. A recent study by the Texas A&M\nTransportation Institute 14, has shown that American commuters spend an average of 54 extra hours a year stuck in traffic congestion. In 2017, commuters wasted an average of 83 hours blocked in traffic. Driving in such conditions increases the anxiety level of drivers, which in consequences can lead to traffic accidents. Similar to the environmental damages caused by traffic congestion, economic losses are also presented. The average cost of extra traffic was $1,010 per commuter. The Texas A&M Transportation Institute expects that in 2025, each commuter will waste 62 hours in traffic, and the cost of national congestion will skyrocket to $200 billion that same year.\n\nAccording to the TomTom Traffic Index 15, in 2017 Mexico City was the most congested city in the world with 66% of additional time spent by drivers stuck in traffic every day, and up to 101% in the evening compared to a free flow traffic, which reckons up to 227 hours of extra travel time per year. The above statistics highlight the detrimental impact of traffic congestion and call for innovative solutions to efficiently deal with this issue in order to make mobility smarter and greener. To achieve such objective, we need first to deal with the heterogeneity of the generated traffic data, collected from different sources, and their associated challenges.\n\nThe most important traffic data sources could be classified into three classes: in-vehicle embedded devices, air and ground monitoring devices and data acquisition techniques.\n\nAnother example of a web service is the data analysis tool developed for big data in Ahrabian, Kolozali, Enshaeifar, Cheong-Took, and Barnaghi (2017).\n\nAccording to Byon *et al*., setting up an effective traffic monitoring system requires a combination of both quantitative and qualitative data. Therefore, data fusion is a compulsory process that needs special attention to efficiently exploit the wealth of existing heterogeneous traffic data sources.\n\nThe above-mentioned heterogeneous sources generate a huge amount of heterogeneous data that need to be fused in order to extract reliable and accurate information. Data fusion is a process that has been widely studied and is usually defined as the process of combining information from different sources in order to provide an advantageous and richer data. One of the most common definition has been proposed by Mitchell *et al*. in Mitchell (2007): \"the theory, techniques and tools which are used for combining sensor data, or data derived from sensory data, into a common representational format ... in performing sensor fusion our aim is to improve the quality of the information, so that it is, in some sense, better than would be possible if the data sources were used individually\".

{"doc_id": 390, "text": "The traditional methods used to measure traffic flow, such as loop detectors and CCTV, are expensive to deploy, suffer from some operational limitations, their accuracy is affected by the weather conditions and requires complex processing of the generated data. New methods have been recently proposed to overcome the above limitations by adopting or using the aforementioned new traffic data sources. We will classify these methods into three categories based on the level of details provided when describing the traffic flow Burghout (2004): microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic. Macroscopic models describe the traffic at a high-level of aggregation as flow (i.e., the number of vehicles per hour that pass through a certain location or a point in the road network), without considering its constituent parts (the vehicles), whereas microscopic models describe, in detail, the behavior of the entities forming the traffic stream (the vehicles) as well as their interactions. Mesoscopic models provide an intermediate level of detail, for instance describing the individual vehicles but not their interactions as stated in Burghout\n\nMicroscopic The microscopic model is the most widely used in traffic flow estimation solutions in the literature.\n\nIt is usually complicated to implement but gives accurate results. A machine learning based solution was proposed in Lefebvre, Chen, Beauseroy, and Zhu (2017) to estimate traffic flow using acoustic sensors, it is characterized by its low cost and processing complexity and its privacy preservation guarantees for road users. This solution has lower cost and processing complexity and guarantees privacy preservation of road users. This solution has been experimentally evaluated during 11.5 days, which is a very short testing duration because the traffic flow varies significantly during different periods of the year (e.g., teaching terms, vacation, Christmas break, special and unpredictable events, etc).\n\nIn Frias-Martinez, Moumni, and Frias-Martinez (2014), it has been proven that passive cell phones network information could be used to estimate traffic flow using a linear regression model. This method can be effective in some traffic conditions. A neural network based model was also proposed in Habtie, Abraham, and Midekso (2016) to estimate traffic flow for urban road network. The architecture used in this work is Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)\nneural network. Traffic data is collected from drivers' mobile phones and used as prob vehicles. The performance of the developed model is evaluated using both simulation and real world experimentation and the obtained results have proven its accuracy.\n\nMacroscopic This class of models is less widely used compared to the previous one but it is easier to implement. It consists in discretizing the space and the time of interest. It is usually based on models like Cell Transmission Model (CTM) Dr. Tom V. Mathew (2017), Link Transmission Model (LTM) Yperman, Logghe, and Immers (2005), and Network Transmission Model (NTM)\nV. L. Knoop and Hoogendoorn (2014), which is based on Microscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) Geroliminis and Daganzo (2008) that has been renamed later as\n\nNetwork Fundamental Diagram (NFD) Keyvan-Ekbatani, Kouvelas, Papamichail, and Papageorgiou (2012).\n\nA Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) model was developed in Levin and Boyles (2016) for roads shared between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human driven vehicles.", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}
{"doc_id": 391, "text": "Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV) is a new concept that was investigated via a simulation framework in Iacobucci, Donhauser, Schmöcker, and Pruckner (2023). Several variants improving LTM have been proposed such as:\nGeneral LTM (GLTM) Gentile et al. (2010), iterative LTM\nHimpe, Corthout, and Tampère (2016) and continuous formulations and analytical properties of the link transmission model Jin (2015). GLTM was used to simulate traffic congestion on urban networks in Gentile (2015)\nby proposing a framework for modeling DTA. LTM was extended by incorporating ramp metering and variable speed limits in Hajiahmadi et al. (2016). Usually, NTM\npredicts the congestion in the current cell and generalizes it to the whole network. In V. Knoop, Tamminga, and Leclercq (2016), NTM was used to predict traffic congestion patterns in large scale networks. The impact of route models on a road network has been studied in Leclercq, Parzani, Knoop, Amourette, and Hoogendoorn (2015). traffic dynamics of a road network. Although LTM has n times lower complexity16 compared to CTM for the same level of accuracy according to Yperman et al. (2005), we have remarked, from the literature review, that CTM is the most used model. It has proven its effectiveness in many systems such as DTA, traffic signals, etc., and recently with AVs. For traffic flow simulation in large scale networks LTM is much more efficient and provides more accurate results than CTM Jin (2015). Mesoscopic This class of models is new compared to the two other classes and combines the advantages of both of them. In terms of level of detail, it is located between microscopic and macroscopic levels. This class is defined, in Burghout (2004), as: \"Mesoscopic models normally describe the traffic entities at a high level of detail, but their behaviour and interactions are described at a lower level of detail\". If we are aiming to perform a microscopic simulation in a large road network but with limited re16i.e, if CTM has a complexity of O(n*n) then LTM complexity is O(n).\n\nFor each type of data a method was proposed and tested on the same dataset. To investigate the performance of the proposed framework, experiments were conducted on a freeway segment. Microscopic simulation has given satisfactory results for only 5% of probe vehicles. However, this framework should be tested on a large scale network for more accurate results.\n\nThe results of traffic flow estimation are generally used as an input to predict the traffic state in the future. Predicting the traffic flow state in urban areas is much more difficult than in freeways. This is due to the complexity of urban road network topology and the huge amount of traffic data generated in cities. However, vehicles velocity is problematic in highways because vehicles move at a very high speed which negatively impacts data collection and dissemination process. Several methods have been proposed to achieve short or long term prediction of traffic flows. These methods leverage a number of strategies such as statistical modeling, machine and deep learning, applying probabilistic distribution on mobile phones GPS data and use simulation techniques to complete the missing data, etc. Therefore, we classify these methods, as shown in Figure 7, into three categories: Modelingbased methods, Learning-based methods and probabilistic & simulation-driven methods. In the following, we describe each of these categories.\n\nModeling-based methods This class relies on a number of models such as statistical models and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model Weiss (1984) and its variants like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Mohamed S. Ahmed (1979). Stochastic Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average\n(SARIMA) is a generalization of ARMA. In addition, Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) has gained a lot of attention for its ability to predict traffic flow states with the corresponding prediction interval. Moreover, Kalman filters have been used for (SARIMA + GARCH) structure implementation. Studies show that this structure is suitable to model the conditional variance traffic flow series Guo, Williams, and Smith (2007). An adaptive Kalman filter approach has been developed in Guo, Huang, and Williams (2014) to predict traffic forecasting in short term, i.e., 15 minutes.\n\nUnlike conventional Kalman filters, which use historical data, this model uses real-time data. This approach has shown good performance, can be adapted for very volatile traffic, and its stability can be maintained by increasing its memory size.", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}
{"doc_id": 392, "text": "Learning-based methods This class involves machine learning, deep learning and neural network methods. A\nStack Autoencoder Model (SAE) is a famous model of deep learning, in which the target output is used as input for the next layer. Because the existing models for traffic flow prediction are not deep enough and model traffic shallowly, according to Lv, Duan, Kang, Li, and Wang\n(2015), the authors of this paper used, for the first time, SAE to model traffic flow features. To use SAE network for traffic prediction, a standard predictor was added in the top layer. The proposed algorithm was tested with 1500 detectors that sent data every 30 seconds, then an aggregation of five minutes interval was performed. The results have shown more than 90% improvement in accuracy compared to other methods for 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes. The methods to which it has been compared are: the Back-Propagation Neural Network (BP NN) model, the Random Walk (RW), the Support Sector Machine (SVM)\nand the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF NN)\nmodel. This solution is not adopted for low traffic conditions and engineering factors such as accidents, weather conditions, etc., that were not taken into account.\n\nIn Fan, Su, Nien, Tsai, and Cheng (2018), a big data analytic based and machine learning driven platform was developed to predict traffic flow state and provide users with traffic state information. Two models have been employed: one-destination travel time prediction (OTTP) for normal traffic conditions and adaptive travel time prognosis (ATTP) for dynamic traffic patterns. The OTTP model is used to choose the adequate beginning time for a journey to steer clear of congestion while the ATTP model aims to reduce travel time.\n\nA short term traffic flow prediction approach named DRBM-FFA was proposed in Goudarzi et al. (2018) to help in reducing traffic congestion impact. This approach makes use of a Deep Belief Network (DBN) with multiple layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) autoencoders. Time series data produced by the RSUs was used as input to build the model and the firefly algorithm (FFA) was used in the training phase. Using Monte Carlo simulations this approach has been shown to be more robust and accurate compared to the following alternative schemes: ARIMA Mohamed S. Ahmed (1979), the conventional MLP neural networks Gardner and Dorling (1998), MLP-FFA, which is a hybridation of MLP\nKennedy (2011) with the firefly algorithm (FFA) Łukasik and Zak (2009) as optimizer and ARIMA-PSO that com- ˙\nbines ARIMA with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as optimizer.\n\nSeveral deep learning models have been recently used to predict traffic flow in short and long term among them:\na deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nstacked autoencoder (SAE) Essien, Petrounias, Sampaio, and Sampaio (2021), LSTM X. Chen et al. (2021), and graph convolutional with LSTM Peng et al. (2021).\n\nProbabilistic & simulation-driven methods This class involves applying probability distribution techniques and simulation when there is a lack of real-world data. That is the main difference between this class and the previous two classes. Recently, a new method that leverages mobile phone GPS data to predict traffic flow has been developed.\n\nThis method is called TRIP Woodard et al. (2017), for Travel Time Reliability Inference and Prediction. In TRIP,\ndata collected from mobile phones or vehicles probes are used in real-time to dynamically predict the probability distribution of travel time. TRIP has shown better results in term of reliability compared to Microsoft's engine for travel time prediction used in Bing Maps.\n\nThe main challenge in traffic prediction for this class is the unavailability of real-time information for some intersections, but a solution for this issue was proposed in Abadi, Rajabioun, and Ioannou (2015). This solution aims to predict traffic flows in transportation networks with limited data in short time up to 30 minutes. The proposed algorithm works in two steps: \"Traffic flow data completion\" and \"Short-term traffic flow prediction\". The former step builds the initial Origin Destination (OD) matrix through simulation, then optimizes it using historical and available real-time data. The results of this step are a Link–to-Link Driving Ratio (LLDR), which gives the link ratio to another adjacent link of traffic flow propagation.", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}
{"doc_id": 393, "text": "The output of the previous step is used in a recursive way to predict traffic flows. The estimated LLDR can be inaccurate due to unexpected events like accidents or closed routes. Therefore, a Monte Carlo experiment was performed where Gravity model was used for transportation forecasting, because of the limited available data, unlike Activity-Based model which is more suitable when more data is available. The proposed algorithm has given accurate results when compared with the measured traffic using only 16% of links with available real-time data.\n\nHowever, it does not provide long-term prediction and the Monte Carlo method used processes in four steps and runs 1000 times for each sample.\n\nTraffic light control is an important parameter in the estimation of travel time. With the increasing number of vehicles and road networks expansion, and hence the number of traffic lights deployed on roads, the management of such systems requires smarter and often more complex scheduling strategies. Metaheuristic algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) Rouphail, Park, and Sacks (2000) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) García-Nieto, Alba, and Olivera (2012), are common scheduling strategies used in this\n\nSecurity is another important aspect that should be considered when designing traffic light control systems because the consequences of a successful attack on such systems would be devastating. In fact, these systems are known to face several problems in communication between the system and vehicles or road monitoring devices such as RSUs. Fog computing 17 was used in Liu et al.\n\nThe second scheme, however, is based on the hash collision puzzle and is more suitable for high vehicles density scenarios. In Kumar, Rahman, and Dhakad (2020) a Dynamic and Intelligent Traffic Light Control System (DITLCS) is developed to update traffic light duration in real-time. Vehicles are given probabilities to allow the system to operate in three different modes: Fair Mode (FM), Priority Mode\n(PM) and Emergency Mode (EM). A model based on reinforcement learning is developed. It selects the color of the light, and s fuzzy inference system chooses the appro17https://www.networkworld.com/article/3243111/\npriate color among the set proposed by the reinforcement learning model. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model gives better results than the other current status of the art solutions.\n\nFigure 8 shows an example of an advanced traffic light control system capable of adapting its cycles based on detected recurrent (or non-recurrent) events on the road.\n\nSuch a system can also exchange relevant information with smart or autonomous vehicles, such as remaining time for the current cycle, equipped with adequate communication capabilities like IEEE802.11p Patel and Ukani\n(2012) and/or LTE-A and 5G Jain, Acharya, Jakhar, and Mishra (2018). In such system communication is bidirectional, from the traffic light to vehicles and vice versa.\n\nThe traffic light control system can send notifications to vehicles about the traffic signal states, such as the light will switch to red in 60 seconds, and/or suggesting the optimal speed to avoid stopping at next intersection. Prioritized vehicles such as police cars, ambulances, and firefighting trucks, can request extending the green light cycle or switching to green if the light is currently red. Another use case would be extending the red light cycle, upon request from police to the road traffic authorities, to delay a suspect or a driver who evaded police control etc.\n\nTraffic routing is an old problem that has been extensively studied in the past, however the advent of new technologies and new power sources for vehicles with their associated constraints call for revisiting it to develop suitable routing algorithms for the era of smart mobility. Finding the optimal path to a given destination is one of the most researched problems in the transportation field. The response time is a crucial criteria that is usually bounded for quality of service purposes and must not exceed a few seconds. In addition, the found optimal/best path should be updated dynamically to account for any sudden change in traffic conditions, due to the occurrence of unpredictable events such as accidents and road closure, while the vehicle is moving towards the destination. Meeting these routing constraints is challenging because the decisions made usually require processing a huge amount of heterogeneous data in a short time, which might not be achievable with the existing routing algorithms. Therefore, such algorithms must be upgraded or novel ones should be developed.", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}
{"doc_id": 394, "text": "In this survey, we only focus on shortest path finding algorithms in transportation systems. The basic algorithms for finding the shortest path, such as Dijkstra Dijkstra (1959) and A* Hart, Nilsson, and Raphael (1968)\nalgorithms, are not suitable for meeting the challenges stated above. In general, these algorithms are divided into two classes: purely search algorithms and preprocessingassisted algorithms that aim to accelerate the routing process through the use of the preprocessing phase results Antsfeld (2013). To further ease the understanding of the routing process in the era of Smart Cities and their advanced means of transport, we propose a new classification based on the used means of transport and the best route selection criteria (i.e., the constraints to optimize).\n\nThe means of transport could be: mono-modal, schedulebased or multi-modal as stated in Bast et al. (2016), while the second parameter could be either single criteria based selection or multi-criteria based selection.\n\nThe used means of transportation could be tram, bike, private vehicle, taxi, bus, etc., if one transport mode only is used then we are in the *mono-modal* class. *Schedule-based* consists of using any combination of buses, train, subway and tram. Finally, the *multi-modal* class includes a combination of any transportation modes with bicycles, private vehicles and walking. In Figure 9, we illustrate the classification of routing algorithms based on the used means of transportation.\n\nRouting algorithms aim to optimize a specific criterion such as: the total travel time or distance, travel cost, safety level, the generated CO2 emissions and number of shift, etc. If we want to optimize a single criterion then we are in the *Mono-Criteria* class. Combining several criteria gives the *Multi-Criteria* class. Examples of the most commonly used routing criteria are depicted is Figure 10. By combining the two parameters mentioned above we obtain six categories of routing algorithms as illustrated\n\nThis class includes the oldest algorithms proposed for routing such as Dijkstra Dijkstra (1959), A* Hart, Nilsson, and Raphael (1972) and Contraction Hierarchies (CH)\nGeisberger, Sanders, Schultes, and Delling (2008). CH is a fast technique that consists of contracting a node, meaning that changing this node by shortcuts representing the shortest paths passing by it.\n\nA bio-inspired heuristic using the travel distance and safety level as main routing criteria was proposed in Osaba, Del Ser, Bilbao, Lopez-Garcia, and Nebro (2018) to find the optimal path for bikes. Moreover, the travel time constraint, which is an implicit consequence of the road length, is also discussed. Open Trip Planner (OTP) 18 was used to calculate the best route that meets the above constraints. The multi-objective bio-inspired approach has been tested on real environment. The obtained results were satisfactory and demonstrated that the developed solution could be used for planning bike rides. Additional constraints could be added to further optimize this solution and, ultimately, testing it with real world open data to accurately assess its performance. Goods Delivery by lorries in urban areas has been studied in Chou, Hsia, and Lan (2017) where a multi-objective approach was developed to reduce the delivery time, distance traveled and resulting cost. This approach works in two steps: \"pre-assigned scheduling\" and \"route planning\". The former identifies the customers requirement, time scheduling and available lorries while the latter plans the route based on the above input. Google Map Application Program Interface (API) is used in the second step to compute the distance and required time to reach a given destination. A feasibility study using a set of lorries was conducted to assess the efficiency of this approach in a real environment. The results were promising and 18http://www.opentripplanner.org\n\nTo achieve this, an algorithm called Greedy-Search-based Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (GSMOGA) was designed. This algorithm combines the speed of greedy search with Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA).\n\nThe evaluation results showed that GSMOGA delivery time is lower than MOGA and Greedy-Search by 63.57%\nand 46.15% respectively.\n\nA traffic regulation system has been developed in Ezzedine, Bonte, Kolski, and Tahon (2008) to coordinate and synchronize departure and arrival times between diverse transport modes. It is obvious that the objective criterion is time optimization. Bus and tram, bi-modal has been used as a case study. This system was integrated with traveller information system to form an Inter-modal Transportation System Management (ITSM). Experiments have been conducted in a realistic simulation environment as part of an urban transportation network project in Valenciennes, France, and the results were promising.", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}
{"doc_id": 395, "text": "Genetic Algorithm (GA) and fuzzy set theory were used in J. Li (2002) to attempt solving bus and train scheduling problem. The aim was to minimize the total number of shifts and shift cost. The proposed approach chooses a schedule from a small set of shifts that has been selected from the set of all feasible shifts. The fuzzy set theory was employed for the first time in this work to solve such a problem. The GA, was applied to avoid decomposition of large driver scheduling problems. The developed approach could be used to solve similar scheduling problems and has been generalized successfully.\n\nTransit\tnode\n\nThis category has attracted a lot of attention in the research community as evidenced by the number of proposed works. The concept of transit node routing, inspired from real world navigation, was introduced in Bast, Funke, and Matijevi´c (2006). When we travel between two distant points, we usually pass by some common edges between different shortest paths. Therefore, the end-points of these edges form a set of \"Transit Nodes\",\nwhich is usually a small set compared to the total number of nodes forming the road network. Having the set of all transit nodes of a given location and the travel time needed to reach all its adjacent transit nodes will definitely improve the computation time of the shortest path to the destination. Moreover, using a central unit that collects, updates and shares such information with different means of transport will improve the travel time. Transit\n\nIn Antsfeld and Walsh (2012), the authors improve the Transit algorithm proposed in Bast et al. (2006) by including multi-modal transportation. Transit algorithm assumes that the network is static, which is not true in the real world. When a change occurs in the network, the precomputed values (e.g., transit nodes and shortest paths)\nare recalculated again despite that some shortest paths are not affected by such change; this was the main motivation of this work. The developed algorithm was called\n\"TRANSIT\".\n\nTo deal with real world scenarios, such as multiobjectiveness, route alternatives and user preferences, the previous work was improved in Leonid and Toby (2012).\n\nThe idea is that in reality users might be interested to know the departure time by giving the arrival time. Thus, the same algorithm is applied using backward links. In order to make the system more user friendly, multiple alternative roads are provided by running a query using the starting location and the departure or arrival time chosen by the user. Then, the best five results are selected. To make the system more reliable, the user is asked to indicate how long he is willing to wait before changing a service.\n\nIn Antsfeld (2013), a new algorithm called CHAT (Cluster, Hierarchy and Hit) was proposed as an extension to Antsfeld and Walsh (2012) in order to enable faster queries and reduce the memory requirement. The authors have adapted their algorithm to the public transport network by developing a new model that combines and improves the two approaches used to model such a network: Time Dependent and Time-Expanded models. The improvement of the Time-Expanded model led to a reduction in storage space by 30% and lower precomputation time. With this modeling, the public transport network is seen as a single transport mode instead of a multi-modal. The same algorithm may involve unnecessary waiting time in some stations or several changes of services. A post-processing is, thus, used to solve this issue; the user is redirected to another path, if it exists, that involves less waiting time although the arrival time is the same. Other works include: SDALT (State-Dependent A* search, Landmarks and Triangle inequality) Kirchler\n(2013), online journey-planning Dib, Manier, Moalic, and Caminada (2017), parking guidance system Gao, Yun, Ran, and Ma (2021) and intermodal transportation Resat and Turkay (2015). Intermodal was defined as: \"being or involving transportation by more than one form of carrier during a single journey\" *Merriam-Webster Dictionary*\n(n.d.).\n\nIn Figure 13, we summarize the discussed routing algorithms in this section along with their different classes and sub-classes. The main objective of a route or journey planner is not limited to making the user journey more comfortable and smooth but also healthier and safer. This is achieved by reducing the time spent by vehicles on roads, thus reducing CO2 emission. In the next section we will describe the impact of S-Mobility on reducing air pollution caused by vehicle movements.\n\nClean air is extremely important for people to live healthy but it has recently become a dream because of air pollution.

We must, therefore, find a balance between the needs of the users and those of the society. In order to reduce air pollution caused by transportation, the number of private vehicles driven on the roads must be reduced and walking, cycling, carpooling or using eco-friendly public transport should be encouraged. A journey planner is also another solution to reduce CO2 emissions. Figure 14 shows the existing solutions for air pollution reduction using S-Mobility, which are further discussed below.\n\nOn-demand buses is a promising solution that assists in minimizing the number of vehicles on roads. Kutsuplus On-Demand Public Transportation Changing Human Mobility in Cities (n.d.), which stands for \"call plus\" in Finnish, is a transport service used in the capital city of Finland, Helsinki, which is more expensive than regular bus lines but cheaper than regular taxis service. It consists of minibuses of nine passengers where rides are arranged through smartphone applications. Prospective passengers input their points of departure and destination along with the desired arrival time to the application. Then, the application generates instantaneous information on where to get on and off and an accompanying timetable. The system computes the optimal route to meet riders' needs, enabling the bus to truly be operated \"on-demand\" as required. The actual fares, while being higher than the normal bus services fare, are lower than using a taxi service.\n\nKutsuplus is an example of efficient on-demand buses service that aims to significantly reduce the number of cars on the roads of Helsinki in 10 years. Helsinki's city au19https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/air-pollutionkills-more-3-million-people-every-year-180956638/?no-ist thorities ambition is to put in place, by 2025, a \"mobility on demand\" system that integrates all forms of shared and public transports with a unified single payment subsystem.\n\nUber 20 is an on-demand taxi system that was launched in San Francisco in 2011 and later in London and Paris in 2012. According to Reuters world news 21, in 2017 Uber was operating in more than 90 European cities. This system operates as follows: the rider enters the desired destination and pick up point. Then the driver contacts the rider and picks him from his location. This application offers different services such as: Uber food, Uber companies, travel, etc. Another similar application to Uber called Apporio-Taxi *apporio home page* (n.d.) is developed by Apporio Infolabs to overcome the code complexity of Uber. It is operational in several countries around the world such as Egypt, Kenya, Mexico, France, etc. Such on-demand taxi service was another way of reducing the number of privately owned cars on the roads and thus lowering air pollution.\n\nElectric bike or simply E-bike is a bicycle with an integrated electric motor. The benefits of cycling for people's health and its positive impact on the society are numerous such as improving people health and fitness and reducing air pollution and the excessive demand on different transport modes. Several countries, such as the Danish government, give a lot of importance to improve cycling and encourage their citizens to use bikes for their short to medium distance travel, especially within urban areas. The danish government aims to make Copenhagen the world's best city for cyclists and to achieve that it sets a number of objectives to reach by 2025 22. Among these objectives, we briefly discuss those related to reducing air pollution:\nnon-motorized transport that preserve environmental sustainability. Cycle tracks, parking facilities for bicycle, valet parking for cyclists, surface treatment for cobblestones, bike repair, weather reports, etc.\n\nBy 2025 this system will be extended to Green Routes, Bicycle Superhighways and the most congested bicycle routes.\n\nThe influence of COVID-19 on electric bicycle safety in China was investigated in Yan and Zhu (2021). The study has demonstrated that the epidemic might dramatically improve e-bike safety concerns in areas with a higher rate of e-bike fatalities and injuries. In the suburbs of Velenje, Slovenia, the authors of Bruzzone, Scorrano, and Nocera\n(2021) looked at the feasibility of employing e-bike sharing and demand-responsive transportation systems. They came to the conclusion that implementing such a system would expand the number of villages with daily and regular access to railway and bus terminals, as well as public services in the city center.\n\nA free-floating carsharing is a system that aims to fulfil the mobility needs of the inhabitants of a given area in a city.", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}

The Uber Elevate team *Uber Elevate* (n.d.) plans to integrate air transport with Uber services by 2023 and thus Uber passengers will be able to fly over congested ground traffic.

{"doc_id": 398, "text": "According to the World Health Organization 26, every year nearly 1.25 million people die as a result of traffic accidents. Approximately 50% of those dying by road traffic crashes are \"vulnerable road users\": pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. From 20 to 50 millions other people are seriously injured and suffer from sustainable disabilities. Moreover, road crashes cause huge economic losses to individuals, their families and nations. They cost each country 3% of its Gross Domestic Production (GDP).\n\nLow and middle income countries are the most vulnerable to traffic accidents with more than 90% of the total deaths in the world, despite having a small percentage of the world's fleet of vehicles, or nearly 54%. African countries are suffering from a high rate of road traffic deaths. Even in developed countries, people from poor backgrounds are more likely to cause traffic accidents. For young people, females are less likely to have traffic accidents than males. About 73% of deceased young males are under the age of 25, the probability of their dying from traffic accidents is three times more compared to young females.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, without sustained actions road traffic crashes are predicted to become the seventh major cause of death by 2030. The newly adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has a plan to minimize the number of road deaths and injuries by 2020 by 50%. Thus, road users safety is an important issue that should be solved by S-Mobility. We group the solutions proposed to increase road users safety into:\nvehicles oriented solutions and pedestrian oriented solutions (see Figure 15).\n\nTable 1. A comparative study of Taxi-Drone solutions\n\nAutonomous cars' advanced technology aims to eliminate the driver's intervention which is often the main cause of accidents. For example, a small electric bus chugged called Sohjoa Fountain (n.d.) is a promising solution in Helsinki. It represents a slow ride toward the future of public transportation. Running at 7 mile/h without a driver, it operates using sensors and software components but currently a person is stationed on board ready to hit a red \"stop\" button if any emergency situation arises. In 2010, Google presented a prototype of a driveless vehicle called later Google Car Markoff (n.d.). According to the U.S.NEWS BEST CARS Kurczewski (n.d.) published on October 2018: \"Fully autonomous cars are currently undergoing testing in several areas of the country, but none are yet available to the general public\". \"This first generation of autonomous vehicles will, in most cases, not be offered for sale or lease to the general public, but instead would be reserved for commercial use by ridehailing fleets and delivery services\" Topics (n.d.). By 2021, the first totally autonomous vehicles introduced by Ford will be in sales. Despite their advanced features, autonomous vehicles bring additional challenges related to privacy issues and their potential vulnerability to cyber attacks, where a remotely controlled autonomous car can be used to launch a terrorist attack, disturb the traffic in highly congested areas, etc.\n\nIn Yaqoob et al. (2019), the authors presented a taxonomy of emerging technologies, requirements, and potential issues for autonomous driving vehicles in smart cities.\n\nHuang *et al.* in Huang and Chen (2020) have also investigated deep learning-based technologies used to enable autonomous driving features, while Yurtsever, Lambert, Carballo, and Takeda (2020) discussed recent trends and unsolved issues of automated driving. Cities are gradually integrating autonomous automobiles driven by artificial intelligence into their transportation portfolios, with significant consequences for the design and sustainability of the built environment. In Cugurullo, Acheampong, Gueriau, and Dusparic (2020), the authors discuss the urban transition to autonomous transportation, depending on three-axis. The first ax is to provide a theoretical framework for comprehending the spread of autonomous vehicles in cities. The second ax depends on the results of a thorough inquiry conducted in Dublin.

To minimize the risk of accidents when performing manoeuvres, such as lane change, vehicles need to coordinate their actions using V2V communication to improve the manoeuvre efficiency and safety level J. Hodgkiss, Djahel, and Hadjadj-Aoul (2019). Vehicles can also report relevant data about accidents, congestion, state of the road, drivers status, etc. This data can be very useful in enabling faster reaction to incidents, minimizing the number of casualties, and timely traffic information delivery to drivers to avoid congested areas, thus reducing further travel delays and the risk of accidents since drivers who are stuck in congestion tend to drive faster to compensate the experienced delay. This critical data must be routed efficiently in order to provide drivers with timely accurate information.\n\nIn Ye, Chen, Li, Ma, and Liu (2021) a microscopic model was proposed to predict vehicle speed using V2X communication. This model uses multivariate time series arrays to model the traffic. The contribution of this work is an energy conservation control system. When compared to the standard logic threshold-based control technique, the suggested strategy increases vehicle energy economy by 13.02% and reduces Carbon dioxide emission by 16.04% under real-world driving circumstances. In Djahel, Doolan, Muntean, and Murphy (2015), the authors discussed in detail vehicular communication and proposed a classification of the existing routing protocols based on the use or not of two parameters: road map network and vehicles mobility model. In Shladover (2018),\nShladover *et al*. provide a survey on connected and automated vehicles technology. Another more recent survey is Zhou, Xu, Chen, and Wang (2020), where the authors discussed the challenges and the issues in progressive V2X\ninnovations for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV).\n\nPedestrian alert system has proved its efficiency for collision avoidance. A pedes-trian-oriented Forewarning System (POFS) was proposed in Liu et al. (2015). It aims to alert pedestrian distracted by smartphone about imminent risks of accidents. The system is composed of three modules: Communication module, collision estimation module and alert module. In the first module, a V2X\ncommunication system is developed to support vehicleto-vehicle, using Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), and vehicle-tosmartphone communication. Long Term Evolution (LTE)\nis the most adopted for vehicle to smartphone communication because of the limited coverage range of WI-FI and the speed of moving cars. An LTE DATA PUSHING (LDP) algorithm is developed to enable downloading data from the server to the pedestrian smartphone in case of a risk of collision with a vehicle in its future path. In the second module, a collision estimation algorithm is proposed to predict the risk of accidents occurrence. The third module alerts pedestrians depending on the smartphone status, which can be: screen-centric state, voice-centric state, screen-voice state and silent state. For each state, there is a different alert mode. This system can warn the pedestrians with a probability of at least 90%.\n\nIn Combs, Sandt, Clamann, and McDonald (2019), a study is conducted to highlight the impact of AVs on pedestrian fatalities on the roads in United States. In this study, a number of scenarios are simulated where ordinary vehicles are replaced by AVs to study how this would affect pedestrians fatalities. A Fatality Analysis Reporting System is used to extract statistics about pedestrian fatalities. Then, the maximum number of pedestrian fatalities that can be avoided using AVs equipped with sensors is identified. The obtained results show that in-vehicles sensors along with other advanced features of AVs can assist in preventing from 30% and up to 90% of pedestrians and vehicles collisions. However, achieving the same results in real world requires high penetration rate of AVs, which is still a futuristic dream and the cost of AVs might be another obstacle towards achieving this dream.\n\nA collision prediction algorithm for pedestrians and Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is proposed in Hussein, García, Armingol, and Olaverri-Monreal (2016). It is based on Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) and Pedestrian-to-Vehicle\n(P2V) communication. It aims at increasing visual situation awareness of VRU for both AVs and regular vehicles, in addition to reducing potential danger on the road and advocating the adoption of AVs by drivers.

Experiments are performed using an electric autonomous vehicle from the iCab project Gomez, MarinPlaza, Hussein, Escalera, and Armingol (2016). It operates by an on-board embedded computer that can be controlled manually. To assess the performance of the proposed solution two metrics are used: \"distance to collision point\" and \"collision danger index against time\". The results are promising and show high detection rate and users were satisfied by the system. Also this system has proved the feasibility of using V2P and P2V communication instead of sensing devices. However, this solution suffers from inaccurate localization data obtained by GPS.\n\nIn Sasaki, Emaru, and Ravankar (2021) an innovative pedestrian recognition system for sidewalk snow removal cars was proposed. It is especially useful for night driving scenarios. Using LiDAR point clouds, the information in front of the snowplow is gathered by grouping and categorizing objects. Support vector machine (SVM) is used to implement this system for recognition and classification of pedestrians. Experiments in real scenarios proved the robustness of this method where the accuracy of classification is high.\n\nIn Kankaria, Jain, Bide, Kothari, and Agarwal (2020) a vehicle-specific alarm system was developed to safeguard the safety of individuals operating the vehicle. It should not only safeguard the safety of drivers but also that of all pedestrians and animals by detecting them. YOLO was chosen to implement this system due to its efficiency in image processing and object recognition accuracy, even with bespoke datasets. Traffic Signs, Human Detection, and Traffic Light Detection were evaluated using GTSRB,\nCOCO, and Bosch datasets, respectively. The model was trained using 80-classes of the already pre-trained YOLO dataset. The execution achieves an accuracy of 91.12% at a processing speed of 30 frames per second, outperforming all the state-of-the-art approaches. The accuracy listed above is the average of the three custom datasets, each of which has substantially better accuracy when trained on YOLO.\n\nThe authors in Izquierdo, del Val, and Villacorta (2021)\ndeveloped a new sensor based on a Micro-ElectroMechanical System, MEMS, Microphone Array to detect the presence of pedestrians. This sensor is not based on brightness, has a low cost, and has a high accuracy detection. In this study, tests were conducted with various persons, and in various ranges, true detection and false alarm detection of the system have been calculated in each scenario. The acquired findings demonstrate that the proposed system can identify and estimate the position of pedestrians, allowing a vehicle going up to 50 km/h to stop and prevent a collision.\n\nA proximity warning system (PWS) was designed for employees in construction and mining sites to prevent collision in Baek and Choi (2020). This system uses smart glasses to detect heavy equipment in proximity. A Bluetooth beacon is installed in the equipment to transmit information collected. In construction and mining sites, personal PWS with smart glasses provides the following notable benefits. For starters, because smart glasses are worn on the face, workers may freely utilize both hands.\n\nSecond, pedestrians can be given immediate visual proximity alerts, allowing them to swiftly assess unsafe circumstances and flee as fast as possible. Finally, the suggested personal PWSs might be deployed and used in mining and construction sites by distributing numerous pairs of smart glasses and Bluetooth beacons to workers, regardless of their magnitude.

Manufacturers have also recently invested in flying taxis *Uber Elevate* (n.d.),\nalso known as passenger drones or taxi drones to reduce ground traffic congestion. HITACHI, FUJITSU, BMW,\namong others, are example of big companies which have developed revolutionary solutions to enable S-Mobility. In this section, we will discuss the most prominent technological solutions dedicated to S-Mobility.\n\nTable 2 summarizes S-Mobility challenges addressed by a number of technological solutions in the market. We can notice the importance given to air pollution due to the increasing awareness of climate change issue and its root causes. In contrast, traffic routing features have not been included in most of the solutions, except of Kutsuplus. Ensuring efficient traffic management is neglected by E-cars and Sohjoa. This latter could also create traffic congestion due to the low speed of its buses which is 7 miles/h on average. Although eliminating or alleviating parking related issues were considered in most of the solutions, Ecars still suffer from this issue in addition to their recharge scheduling and the range anxiety problem. Most manufacturers of recent innovative mobility means, such as Sohjoa, Google cars and E-car, developed enhanced safety and security measures for their passengers.\n\nThe advent of new technologies, like the aforementioned ones, have inspired researchers to develop new systems and architectures for S-Mobility, some of which are described in the following.\n\nIn this subsection, we briefly discuss a selection of systems developed by major actors to support S-Mobility.\n\nIn order to find the best trade-off between individual users mobility needs and constraints and the impact of the chosen transportation means on the society and the environment, Hitachi Okuda et al. (2012) proposed the concept of \"smooth and sustainable\" S-Mobility. This implies that the mobility service must run \"smoothly\" for the users without causing damage to the society. Okuda *et al*. proposed an architecture to implement this concept, in which all transportation companies of Japan are involved. To collect and analyze data from different companies and provide each of them with the required data to run their service, an efficient coordination between these companies is required. To achieve that, Hitachi has developed a solution that consists of five layers: transportation user experience layer, transportation services layer, information collection layer, information management and control layer, and transportation company coordination layer.\n\nTo optimize the whole system, three types of optimization are used: service optimization, intra-company optimization and optimization of coordination between different transportation companies. This solution, however, does not support multi-model transportation and requires an active participation from users and transportation companies, which might limit its impact and applicability in other contexts where such participation is not at the expected level. This is true as most companies are reluctant to share their data unless there is a clear incentive or benefit for them.\n\nTable 2. **The main focus of major technological solutions for Smart Mobility**\n\nFujitsu Kawasaki (2015) considers that multifaceted solutions are needed to develop an efficient mobility service because this latter depends on several factors such as the stage of economic development of the country and the region where the solution is used. In 2012, two recommendations have been made by the Transportation Policies Council of the Japanese Productivity Center in order to achieve a S-Mobility society. The first consists in creating a system that connects in-vehicle devices to users smartphones, and developing new technologies for indoor/outdoor data collection that can be adapted to work with the Japan's Indoor Messaging System (IMES)\n27, which is an indoor GPS. The second recommendation is to make elderly mobility run smoothly through encouraging personal mobility vehicles (PMVs), developing new systems, in addition to creating parking and paths for bicycles.", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}

The huge amount of data collected by taxi probe data was leveraged to build a traffic information system on the cloud. This solution supports mobility on demand and multi-modal transportation and its ultimate goal is to ensure high level of safety on road for the commuters regardless of what means of transport is being used. In addition, it uses car sharing and gives a lot of attention to bicycles unlike the previous solution developed by Hitachi. Fujitsu classified S-Mobility into three categories: *\"personal mobility\", \"safe and secure mobility\"*\nand *\"pleasant mobility\"*.\n\nIt is worth noting that Fujitsu's solution focused more on elderly, which makes it unsuitable for other users from different age groups.\n\nThe German Aerospace Center (DLR) Suske et al. (2016)\nproposed a new Traffic Information System (TIS) that uses social media and environmental information as new data sources to support S-Mobility services. To significantly improve traffic fluidity, such TIS requires that people are connected to ensure their free mobility, vehicles and Ecars are also connected to reduce air pollution, in addition to using shared and public transportation. The proposed TIS can provide three categories of data: real time, predictive and historical data. To implement such a TIS in every smart city, Suske *et al*. believe that an environment information system as well as traffic management center are required. Although this developed TIS highlights the experience of DLR in the S-Mobility and represents an example of their supremacy in this field, successfully implementing it in other Smart Cities in different parts of the world might be challenging due to its complexity and the required expertise and time to make it fully operational.\n\nVehicular Social Networks (VSNs), which are social networks integrated with Internet of Vehicles, are characterized by more dynamic, due to vehicles movement, but weaker relationships compared to traditional social networks. VSNs are usually used to support safety-related and entertainment-based applications. In Ning et al.\n\nAccording to this study, to efficiently support S-Mobility objectives VSNs need to overcome a number of challenges in relation to message dissemination, big trajectory data analysis and trust, as well as security and privacy preservation. Therefore, in spite of its promising features and potential, VSNs technology is still in its infancy and substantial development is still needed to make it credible enabler of S-Mobility.\n\nIn Table 3, we compare the aforementioned systems in terms of the set of S-Mobility challenges covered by each of them. We can easily deduce that parking management is neglected by all the proposed systems while they address traffic management and routing issues in addition to minimizing air pollution. Ensuring high level of safety for road users is a paramount objective for S-Mobility but it has not been addressed by the above systems, except Fujitsu system. In Table 4, we compare the above systems based on their distinguishing features and limitations. The comparison metrics include the level of development of the system in terms of the attained Technology Readiness Levels (TRL).\n\nThe level of maturity of the proposed solutions by these systems varies from defining a new concept and architecture to the development of a robust model and its implementation in a new platform. Other metrics used are the source of traffic data collected, its type in terms of whether its source is fixed location or mobile, the architecture of the data storage solution (centralized database vs. distributed database) as well as its scalability level.\n\nMoreover, ensuring the security and privacy preservation of users (i.e., drivers and passengers) personal or sensitive data (e.g., their location) is fundamental to ensure wide acceptance of such systems by citizens and their voluntary participation in the data collection phase through their smartphones. In order to validate any proposed solution for S-Mobility, we must test it using real data, testbed or simulation platforms.

{"doc_id": 403, "text": "The aim of this section is to highlight the limitations of current enabling technological solutions for S-Mobility and shed the light on main prospects for future research directions in this emerging field. The lack of an efficient system or platform that provides solutions to all challenges associated with different aspects of S-Mobility eventually results in several shortcomings that affect Smart Cities citizens' quality of life. The efficient management of traffic flows, achieving optimal multi-modal and multi-criteria routing and significantly reducing air pollution are the most addressed challenges in the developed systems and platforms. The efficient parking management and ensuring road safety, however, have received less attention in these existing systems although they play a major role in the mobility ecosystem. In what follows, we summarise the lessons learned from this survey in relation to each of these challenges and provide our vision on how to address them in the future.\n\nThe inefficient management of available parking spots is one of the most influencing factor of the increase in traffic congestion in cities. In this survey, we focused on investigating free parking space detection inaccuracy issues. From the literature review, we found that sensor devices and smartphone-based applications are the most used data sources in this context. Sensors are usually preferred to avoid privacy and security issues related to crowd sensing in addition to the willingness of users to participate in this process. Moreover, free-riders and selfish liars negatively affect the quality of collected data. On the other hand, sensor readings can be affected by environmental conditions in addition to the incurred cost for the installation. Despite its high scalability and reliability, computer vision is still an expensive data source for parking management systems and is not suitable for outdoor parking due to its sensitivity to weather conditions. Recently object detection algorithms are used to identify the availability of parking spaces instead of detecting weather a given place or block of spaces is free or occupied. This solution is affordable, scalable, and simple to implement and update. As any other system, parking management is not just data collection but involves also data processing, data storage (centralized or distributed), data analytics, data dissemination, system deployment (large scale),\netc. As a futuristic vision, we believe that parking management issues could be relieved, especially in urban areas, through supplementing the existing car parks capacity and on-street parking spots with private parking spots of local inhabitants who can lease their spots, when they are not used, to reduce the impact of cruising for parking on the congestion level and earn extra income from this service. Realizing this service, however, requires involvement of both start-up companies and city authorities to regulate this service and ensure its success.\n\nTraffic congestion causes economic and human losses as well as environmental damages. To avoid such negative impact or at least minimize it, traffic management techniques are used, which include, but not limited to, traffic flow estimation and prediction along with traffic light control systems. Methods used to estimate traffic flow are grouped into three classes: microscopic, macroscopic and mesoscopic. The first class is the most widely used due to its accuracy although it is more complicated to implement. Macroscopic models are less popular than the previous class but easier to implement as they provide a general view of the road network traffic instead of studying individual vehicles movement. The last class\n\nTable 3. **S-Mobility challenges covered by the proposed systems**\nTable 4. **A summary of the main features and limitations of the proposed S-Mobility solutions**\n\nPredicting the evolution of traffic flow in urban areas is more difficult than freeways due to the complexity of the road layout and traffic pattern variations. As opposed to long-term traffic prediction, short-term traffic prediction is more accurate since the used data are updated more frequently at the expense of the required large storage and fast processing. Achieving fast and accurate shortterm traffic prediction is a necessity as it enables faster and more efficient response to potential bottlenecks. We foresee that Intel's Myriad X Vision Processing Unit (VPU)-\nthe first of its class to feature the Neural Compute Engine\n- providing a dedicated hardware accelerator for deep neural network inferences will enable the development of new highly accurate deep neural network based traffic prediction models. Such models are expected to meet the above speed and accuracy requirements. Responding efficiently to predicted deterioration of traffic conditions may involve alteration of default driving policies or traffic signalling systems through smart and adaptive traffic light control systems, such as the schemes developed in S. D. et al. (2020) and ALEKO and Djahel (2020), or virtually inflating road network capacity through granting selected set of vehicles temporary access to under-utilized reserved lanes S. D. et al. (2018). We believe that the future of traffic management system is VANET-based. Due to their rapid reactions, self-driving cars would significantly reduce traffic congestion and accidents. However, with VANETs in particular and IoT-based systems in general, privacy, security, and authentication difficulties become crucial challenges.", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}
{"doc_id": 404, "text": "Promoting the use of multi-model transportation by citizens can significantly alleviate several traffic related issues and make commuters travel more comfortable. Integrating Electric Vehicles (EVs) and flying taxis in multimodel transportation systems will be beneficial in many ways, such as reducing air pollution and efficiently offloading ground transportation system in highly congested urban areas. Such system requires optimal and accurate complex planning of departure and arrival times of different transportation means to satisfy commuters constraints and ensure efficient use of the whole system capacity with minimum running cost. In any transportation system, achieving optimal or near optimal routing based on single or multiple best route selection criteria is necessary. Achieving this in S-Mobility is, however, more challenging as additional constraints need to be considered. For example, an optimal route for an EV journey should account for the number and location of charging stations, the expected waiting time at stations if a recharge is needed during the vehicle journey, its remaining battery on-board and its battery capacity A. M. et al.\n\nBased on the findings of this survey, we believe that AI enabled routing techniques, such as J. Q. J. et al. (2019),\nsupported by multi-agent systems embedded in the smart road infrastructure (e.g., run by Intelligent Traffic Light Control Systems (ITLCS)) to quickly and efficiently adapt the route to avoid unpredictable events and their associated delay S. W. et al. (2016). Optimal battery recharge scheduling Rottondi and Verticale (2016) is another issue that is yet to be tackled efficiently, solving it for both EVs and drones used for traffic monitoring will significantly improve the quality of routes suggested to drivers and make the overall transportation system run more efficiently with less emissions. Moreover, although it requires substantial investment in upgrading current road infrastructure if the technology being developed is adopted and widely implemented, wireless charging for EVs will significantly increase the acceptance of EVs by the public I. H. et al. (2018). Such technology allows EVs to recharge their battery wirelessly on the move using dedicated road lanes equipped with such capability. Qualcomm Halo is an example of wireless car charging system currently used by Formula E electric race series to keep the batteries of the BMW i3 medical cars and i8 safety car recharged during each race weekend.\n\nThe above technology will certainly leads to an increase of the EVs penetration rate and supports the future vision of transport electrification (i.e., electric vehicles, buses and bikes etc.) to tackle climate change issues and air pollution. The implementation of this approach is facing multiple issues related to battery charging speed, communication protocols and security issues (vulnerability, privacy, etc.). Using EVs as shared cars, known as electric vehiclesharing, is very promising solution as it reduces the fleet of cars on the road and lower the emissions. Furthermore, if EVs are recharged from solar power system, this can further reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the city. Finally, we believe that Mobility as a Service (MaaS) combined with transport electrification could be an efficient solution that significantly reduces the fleet of vehicles on the road while maintaining clean air in the city and providing mobility service that meets the commuters requirements.\n\nRoad accidents are usually caused by drivers' dangerous manoeuvres, the deteriorated state of both road infrastructure and vehicles, especially in developing countries where the fleet of old vehicles is significant. In order to make commuters travel safer and protect vulnerable pedestrians from accidents adequate measures should be taken. Such measures include developing pedestrianoriented alert systems that alert pedestrians distracted by the extensive use of their smartphones to the immediate danger of approaching vehicles Liu et al. (2015). Likewise, the era of autonomous vehicles opens up opportunities for enhancing the drivers and pedestrians safety through connecting wearable sensors, worn by the driver to monitor his sleep signs and predict sudden health problems, to the vehicle to switch the control to autonomous driving when needed to avoid accidents.\n\nEnhancing the smartness of the new constructed roads and upgrading the existing infrastructure to make it more interactive with autonomous vehicles, for example, will certainly play a major role in reducing causalities on the roads. Such smart roads will be a source of a wealth of traffic data that can be of utmost importance to autonomous vehicles as well as traffic authorities to help them make optimal decisions to enhance the road safety.", "filename": "Smart Mobility in Smart Cities Emerging Challenges Recent Advances and Future Directions.md"}
{"doc_id": 405, "text": "However, the vulnerability of autonomous vehicles to cyber attacks B. S. et al. (2019) will constantly threaten the road safety if sophisticated countermeasures are not in place. Indeed, a hacker who succeeds to remotely control an autonomous vehicle can cause serious disruption to the traffic flow with high risks of human lives loss. Therefore, car manufacturers and cyber security researches and SMEs are invited to join their efforts to be ahead of the hackers by constantly thinking of new attack scenarios and developing solutions to face them. C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything) communication technologies refer to a system, where \"everything\" (i.e., the X) may be a different car, a person walking, a piece of road infrastructure, or a network server. This new emerging technology can enhance data collection and processing which will improve the decision making.\n\nWe believe that the emerging concept of MaaS Goodall, Dovey, Bornstein, and Bonthron (2017) Y. Li and Voege\n(2017) could be an efficient solution to the above discussed challenges. MaaS aims to make the mobility as another consumer service that citizens use and pay for based on their needs. It promises to ensure affordable, fast, secure and clean mobility anywhere, anytime and anyhow. MaaS will require the development of a unified and integrated mobility system, high penetration rate of connected and autonomous vehicles, multi-model transport system, coordination between ground and air transport means for enhanced sustainability, in addition to well defined regulation for the use of both autonomous vehicles and Taxi-Drone. A unified mobility system that integrates the traffic management system, parking management system and traffic routing system could yield substantial benefits in terms of the ability of controlling the traffic flow and mitigating the creation of bottlenecks in specific locations. This can be achieved through a well defined coordination among these three systems, for example knowing in real-time the occupancy level of different car parks in city center enables the routing system to route the vehicles in a way that minimizes their cruising time to select or reserve a parking spot. Likewise, the prediction information provided by traffic management system helps the parking and routing management systems to coordinate their decisions so that any predicted congestion could be avoided or at least alleviated Djahel et al. (2015).\n\nThis survey provided a comprehensive analysis of the most important emerging challenges that need to be overcome to successfully realize the Smart Mobility (SMobility) dream. The addressed challenges covered the main aspects of S-Mobility ranging from parking management to ensuring road safety and lowering air pollution. We also discussed a number of recent technological advances aiming to provide the required systems, platforms and data to underpin the services to be offered by S-Mobility providers to their users. A summary of major limitations impacting the efficiency of existing technological advances supporting different aspects of S-Mobility are also highlighted and future research directions are discussed. Lessons learned from this survey suggest that the integration of different aspects of S-Mobility and the adoption of MaaS framework, underpinned by advanced AI techniques, will shape the future of S-Mobility and determines its successful implementation in Smart Cities.\n\nAbadi, A., Rajabioun, T., & Ioannou, P.

International Energy Agency Website: www.iea.org\n\nThe Global EV Outlook is an annual publication that identifies and assesses recent developments in electric mobility across the globe. It is developed with the support of members of the Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI). Combining analysis of historical data with projections - now extended to 2035 - the report examines key areas of interest such as the deployment of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, battery demand, investment trends, and related policy developments in major and emerging markets. It also considers what wider EV adoption means for electricity and oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The report includes analysis of lessons learned from leading markets, providing information for policy makers and stakeholders on policy frameworks and market systems that support electric vehicle uptake.\n\nThis edition also features analysis of electric vehicle affordability, second-hand markets, lifecycle emissions of electric cars and their batteries, and grid impacts from charging medium- and heavy-duty electric trucks. Two online tools are made available alongside the report: the Global EV Data Explorer and the Global EV \nPolicy Explorer, which allow users to interactively explore EV statistics and projections, and policy measures worldwide.\n\nThe *Global EV Outlook 2024* was prepared by the Energy Technology Policy \n(ETP) Division of the Directorate of Sustainability, Technology and Outlooks (STO) of the International Energy Agency (IEA). The project was designed and directed by Timur Gül, Chief Energy Technology Officer. Araceli Fernandez Pales, Head of the Technology Innovation Unit, provided strategic guidance throughout the development of the project. Elizabeth Connelly co-ordinated the analysis and production of the report. The principal IEA authors were (in alphabetical order): Oskaras Alšauskas, Elizabeth Connelly, Mathilde Huismans, Ethan Jenness, Javier Jorquera Copier, Jean-Baptiste Le Marois, Teo Lombardo, Shane McDonagh, Vera O'Riordan, Apostolos Petropoulos and Jules Sery. Yoshihisa Tsukamoto and Biqing Yang contributed to the research on EV supportive policies and OEM electrification plans. Vedant Sinha contributed to analysis on EV price parity and data management. Anthony Vautrin contributed to the analysis on total and net load impacts of electric truck charging, Hikaru Ito and Hasti Wiandita contributed to research on Indonesia.\n\nValuable insights and feedback were provided by senior management and other colleagues from across IEA, including Laura Cozzi, Keisuke Sadamori, Brian Motherway, Alessandro Blasi, Toril Bosoni, Dennis Hesseling, Stéphanie Bouckaert, Alexander Bressers, Federico Callioni, Shobhan Dhir, Ciaran Healy, Thomas Spencer and Jacques Warichet. Per-Anders Widell provided essential support throughout the process. Lizzie Sayer edited the manuscript. \n\nSpecial thanks go to Prof. Andreas Ulbig and his team at RWTH Aachen University (Andreas Bong and Chris Vertgewall) for their analytical input on electric heavy-duty vehicle integration in electricity grids. \n\nThanks go to the IEA's Communications and Digital Office, particularly to Jethro Mullen, Poeli Bojorquez, Curtis Brainard, Jon Custer, Hortense de Roffignac, Astrid Dumond, Merve Erdil, Grace Gordon, Julia Horowitz, Oliver Joy, Isabelle Nonain-Semelin, Clara Vallois, Lucile Wall and Wonjik Yang. \n\nThe work could not have been achieved without the financial support provided by the EVI member governments and the funds received through the Global E-Mobility Programme funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).

Tight margins, volatile battery metal prices, high inflation, and the phase-out of purchase incentives in some countries have sparked concerns about the industry's pace of growth, but global sales data remain strong. In the first quarter of 2024, electric car sales grew by around 25% compared with the first quarter of 2023, similar to the year-on-year growth seen in the same period in 2022. In 2024, the market share of electric cars could reach up to 45% in China, 25% in Europe and over 11% in the United States, underpinned by competition among manufacturers, falling battery and car prices, and ongoing policy support. \n\nGrowth **expectations for 2024 build on a record year: in 2023, global sales of** \nelectric cars neared 14 **million, reaching 18% of all cars sold.** This is up from 14% in 2022. Electric car sales in 2023 were 3.5 million higher than in 2022, a 35% year-on-year increase. This indicates robust growth even as many major markets enter a new phase, with uptake shifting from early adopters to the mass market. Over 250 000 electric cars were sold every week last year, more than the number sold in a year just a decade ago. Chinese carmakers produced more than half of all electric cars sold worldwide in 2023, despite accounting for just 10% of global sales of cars with internal combustion engines. The pace at which electric car sales pick up in emerging and developing economies outside China will determine their global success. The vast majority of electric car sales in 2023 were in China (60%), Europe (25%) and the United States (10%). By comparison, these regions accounted for around 65% of total car sales worldwide, showing that sales of electric models remain more geographically concentrated than those of conventional ones. While electric car sales in emerging economies have been lagging those in the three big markets, growth picked up in 2023 in countries such as Viet Nam (around 15% of all cars sold) and Thailand (10%). In emerging economies with large car markets, shares are still relatively low, but several factors point to further growth. Policy measures such as purchase subsidies and incentives for electric vehicle (EV) and battery manufacturing are playing a key role. In India (where electric cars have a 2% \nmarket share), the Production Linked Incentives (PLI) Scheme is supporting domestic manufacturing. In Brazil (3% share), Indonesia, Malaysia (2% share each), and Thailand, cheaper models, mainly from Chinese brands, are underpinning uptake. In Mexico, EV supply chains are rapidly developing, stimulated by access to subsidies from the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 420, "text": "Every other car sold globally in 2035 is set to be electric based on today's energy, climate and industrial policy settings, as reflected in the IEA's Stated Policies Scenario. This has significant impacts on the car fleet. As soon as 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is electric in this scenario, and almost one in five in both the United States and European Union. The rapid uptake of EVs of all types - cars, vans, trucks, buses and two/three-wheelers - avoids 6 million barrels per day (mb/d) of oil demand in the Stated Policies Scenario in 2030, and over 10 mb/d in 2035. This is equivalent to the amount of oil used for road transport in the United States today. Recent policy developments continue to reinforce expectations for swift electrification, such as new emissions standards adopted in Canada, the European Union and the United States over the past year. Industrial incentives - such as those in the US IRA, the EU Net Zero Industry Act, China's 14th Five-Year Plan, and India's PLI scheme - also encourage adding value and creating jobs across EV supply chains in those economies. If all the national energy and climate targets made by governments are met in full and on time, as in the Announced Pledges Scenario, two-thirds of all vehicles sold in 2035 could be electric, avoiding around 12 mb/d of oil. Expectations of strong growth are bolstering investment in the EV supply chain. Recent reporting shows that from 2022 to 2023, investment announcements in EV and battery manufacturing totalled almost USD 500 billion, of which around 40% has been committed. Over 20 major car manufacturers, representing more than 90% of global car sales in 2023, have set electrification targets. Taking the targets of all the largest automakers together, more than 40 million electric cars could be sold in 2030, which would meet the level of deployment projected under today's policy settings. \n\nEnough battery manufacturing capacity has reached a final investment decision to deliver on announced pledges from automakers and governments globally. Thanks to high levels of investment in the past 5 years, global EV battery manufacturing capacity far exceeded demand in 2023, at around 2.2 terawatt-hours and 750 gigawatt-hours, respectively. Demand is likely to grow quickly: up seven times by 2035 compared with 2023 in the Stated Policies Scenario, nine times in the Announced Pledges Scenario, and 12 times in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, which lays out a pathway to reach net zero energy sector emissions by mid-century. Manufacturing capacity appears capable of keeping pace with demand: committed and existing battery manufacturing capacity alone are practically aligned with the needs in a net zero pathway in 2030. \n\nSuch prospects are opening significant opportunities across the supply chain for battery and mining companies, including in emerging markets outside China, although surplus capacity has been hurting margins and may lead to further market consolidation.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 421, "text": "Electric cars are getting cheaper as competition intensifies, particularly in China, but they remain more expensive than cars with internal combustion engines in other markets. A rapid transition to EVs will require bringing to market more affordable models. In China, we estimate that more than 60% of electric cars sold in 2023 were already cheaper than their average combustion engine equivalent. However, electric cars remain 10% to 50% more expensive than combustion engine equivalents in Europe and the United States, depending on the country and car segment. In 2023, two-thirds of available electric models globally were large cars, pick-up trucks or sports utility vehicles, pushing up average prices. When exactly price parity is reached is subject to a range of market variables, but current trends suggest that it could be reached by 2030 in major EV markets outside China for most models. The pricing strategies of car manufacturers will be crucial for improving affordability, as will the pace of EV battery price decline. Turmoil in battery metal markets in 2022 led to the first price increase for lithium-ion packs, which became 7% more expensive than in 2021. In 2023, however, the prices of the key metals used to make batteries dropped, leading to a near-14% fall in pack prices year-on-year. China still supplies the cheapest batteries, but prices across regions are converging as batteries become a globalised commodity. Lithium-ironphosphate batteries - which are significantly cheaper than those based on lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt oxide - accounted for over 40% of global EV sales by capacity in 2023, more than double their share in 2020. Looking ahead, technological innovation will remain important for scaling up novel designs and chemistries such as sodium-ion batteries, which could cost as much as 20% less than lithium-based batteries without requiring any lithium.\n\nIn developing economies outside China, more affordable electric car models are arriving, and the future of electric two- **and three-wheelers already looks** \nbright. In 2023, 55% to 95% of the electric car sales across major emerging and developing economies were large models that are unaffordable for the average consumer, hindering mass-market uptake. However, smaller and much more affordable models launched in 2022 and 2023 have quickly become bestsellers, especially those by Chinese carmakers expanding overseas. Affordable electric two- and three-wheelers are also already available, helping deliver immediate benefits such as improved air quality and emissions reductions. Around 1.3 million electric two-wheelers were sold in India and Southeast Asia in 2023, accounting for 5% and 3% of total sales, respectively. One in five three-wheelers sold globally in 2023 was electric, and nearly 60% of those sold in India, boosted by the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME II) subsidy scheme. As electric vehicle markets mature, second-hand electric cars will become more widely available. In 2023, the market size for used electric cars was around 800 000 in China, 400 000 in the United States, and over 450 000 across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The prices of used electric cars are falling quickly and becoming competitive with combustion engine equivalents. Looking ahead, international trade of used electric cars is also expected to increase, including to emerging and developing economies outside of China.\n\nThe battery recycling industry is getting ready for the 2030s. Recycling and reuse are needed for supply chain sustainability and security. Many technology developers are seeking to position themselves in EV end-of-life markets, but planned locations do not always align with where EV retirement may occur. Global battery recycling capacity reached 300 gigawatt-hours in 2023. If all announced projects materialise, it could exceed 1 500 gigawatt-hours in 2030, of which 70% \nwould be in China. Globally, announced recycling capacity is more than three times the supply of batteries that could potentially be recycled in 2030, as EVs reach their end of life in the Announced Pledges Scenario. However, EV battery retirement is expected to grow rapidly from the second half of the 2030s.\n\nThe global number **of installed public charging points was up 40% in 2023** \nrelative to 2022, and growth for fast chargers outpaced that of slower **ones**. \n\nIn major EV markets, the deployment of charging points is continuing apace thanks to targeted policies. Broad, affordable access to public charging infrastructure will be needed for a mass-market switch to electric transport and to enable longer journeys - even if most charging continues to take place privately in residential and workplace settings. To reach EV deployment levels in the Announced Policies Scenario, public charging needs to increase sixfold by 2035.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 422, "text": "As more electric heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks and large buses hit the road, dedicated and flexible charging is needed. In 2023, electric buses accounted for 3% of total bus sales. Electric truck sales jumped 35% compared with 2022, accounting for about 3% of truck sales in China and 1.5% in Europe. Under today's policy settings, the stock of electric buses increases sevenfold by 2035 and that of electric trucks around thirtyfold, supported by tougher emissions standards in the United States and European Union. This level of deployment could require a twentyfold jump in charging capacity by 2035 - not only in depots, but also along main transit routes to enable long-distance trucking. Increasing heavy-duty charging has important implications for expanding and operating electrical grids, with opportunities for greater flexibility and renewables integration. \n\nPolicy support, careful planning and co-ordination will be essential to ensure a secure, affordable and low-emissions supply of electricity with limited strain on local grids.\n\nThe Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI) is a multi-governmental policy forum established in 2010 under the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM). Recognising the opportunities offered by EVs, the EVI is dedicated to accelerating the adoption of EVs worldwide. To do so, it strives to better understand the policy challenges related to electric mobility, to help governments address them and to serve as a platform for knowledge-sharing among government policy makers. The EVI also facilitates exchanges between government policy makers and a variety of other partners on topics important for the transition to electric mobility, such as charging infrastructure and grid integration as well as EV battery supply chains. The International Energy Agency serves as the co-ordinator of the initiative. \n\nGovernments that have been active in the EVI in the 2023-24 period include Canada, Chile, People's Republic of China (hereafter \"China\"), Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. Canada, China, the Netherlands and the United States are the co-leads of the initiative. The Global EV Outlook annual series is the flagship publication of the EVI. It is dedicated to tracking and monitoring the progress of electric mobility worldwide and to informing policy makers on how to best accelerate electrification of the road transport sector.\n\nElectric car sales neared 14 million in 2023, 95% of which were in China, Europe and the United States Almost 14 million new electric cars1 were registered globally in 2023, bringing their total number on the roads to 40 million, closely tracking the sales forecast from the 2023 edition of the Global EV Outlook (GEVO-2023). Electric car sales in 2023 were 3.5 million higher than in 2022, a 35% year-on-year increase. This is more than six times higher than in 2018, just 5 years earlier. In 2023, there were over 250 000 new registrations per week, which is more than the annual total in 2013, ten years earlier. Electric cars accounted for around 18% of all cars sold in 2023, up from 14% in 2022 and only 2% 5 years earlier, in 2018. These trends indicate that growth remains robust as electric car markets mature. Battery electric cars accounted for 70% of the electric car stock in 2023.\n\nWhile sales of electric cars are increasing globally, they remain significantly concentrated in just a few major markets. In 2023, just under 60% of new electric car registrations were in the People's Republic of China (hereafter \"China\"), just under 25% in Europe, 2 and 10% in the United States - corresponding to nearly 95% of global electric car sales combined. In these countries, electric cars account for a large share of local car markets: more than one in three new car registrations in China was electric in 2023, over one in five in Europe, and one in ten in the United States. However, sales remain limited elsewhere, even in countries with developed car markets such as Japan and India. As a result of sales concentration, the global electric car stock is also increasingly concentrated.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 423, "text": "Nevertheless, China, Europe and the United States also represent around twothirds of total car sales and stocks, meaning that the EV transition in these markets has major repercussions in terms of global trends. In China, the number of new electric car registrations reached 8.1 million in 2023, increasing by 35% relative to 2022. Increasing electric car sales were the main reason for growth in the overall car market, which contracted by 8% for conventional (internal combustion engine) cars but grew by 5% in total, indicating that electric car sales are continuing to perform as the market matures. The year 2023 was the first in which China's New Energy Vehicle (NEV) 3 industry ran without support from national subsidies for EV purchases, which have facilitated expansion of the market for more than a decade. Tax exemption for EV purchases and non-financial support remain in place, after an extension, as the automotive industry is seen as one of the key drivers of economic growth. Some province-led support and investment also remains in place and plays an important role in China's EV landscape. As the market matures, the industry is entering a phase marked by increased price competition and consolidation. In addition, China exported over 4 million cars in 2023, making it the largest auto exporter in the world, among which 1.2 million were EVs. This is markedly more than the previous year - car exports were almost 65% higher than in 2022, and electric car exports were 80% higher. The main export markets for these vehicles were Europe and countries in the Asia Pacific region, such as Thailand and Australia. In the United States, new electric car registrations totalled 1.4 million in 2023, increasing by more than 40% compared to 2022. While relative annual growth in 2023 was slower than in the preceding two years, demand for electric cars and absolute growth remained strong. The revised qualifications for the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, alongside electric car price cuts, meant that some popular EV models became eligible for credit in 2023. Sales of the Tesla Model Y, for example, increased 50% compared to 2022 after it became eligible for the full USD 7 500 tax credit. Overall, the new criteria established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) \nappear to have supported sales in 2023, despite earlier concerns that tighter domestic content requirements for EV and battery manufacturing could create immediate bottlenecks or delays, such as for the Ford F-150 Lightning. As of 2024, new guidance for the tax credits means the number of eligible models has fallen to less than 30 from about 45, 4 including several trim levels of the Tesla Model 3 becoming ineligible. However, in 2023 and 2024, leasing business models enable electric cars to qualify for the tax credits even if they do not fully meet the requirements, as leased cars can qualify for a less strict commercial vehicle tax credit and these tax credit savings can be passed to lease-holders. Such strategies have also contributed to sustained electric car roll-out.\n\nIn Europe, new electric car registrations reached nearly 3.2 million in 2023, increasing by almost 20% relative to 2022. In the European Union, sales amounted to 2.4 million, with similar growth rates. As in China, the high rates of electric car sales seen in Europe suggest that growth remains robust as markets mature, and several European countries reached important milestones in 2023. \n\nGermany, for example, became the third country after China and the United States to record half a million new battery electric car registrations in a single year, with 18% of car sales being battery electric (and another 6% plug-in hybrid). \n\nHowever, the phase-out of several purchase subsidies in Germany slowed overall EV sales growth. At the start of 2023, PHEV subsidies were phased out, resulting in lower PHEV sales compared to 2022, and in December 2023, all EV subsidies ended after a ruling on the Climate and Transformation Fund. In Germany, the sales share for electric cars fell from 30% in 2022 to 25% in 2023. This had an impact on the overall electric car sales share in the region. In the rest of Europe, however, electric car sales and their sales share increased. Around 25% of all cars sold in France and the United Kingdom were electric, 30% in the Netherlands, and 60% in Sweden. In Norway, sales shares increased slightly despite the overall market contracting, and its sales share remains the highest in Europe, at almost 95%.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 424, "text": "In 2023, the global stock of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) increased by around 20% compared to 2022, reaching 87 600 by the end of the year. Of the 15 400 new FCEVs hitting the roads in 2023, about half were cars, around one-quarter were medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and almost 10% were buses. The fastest-growing segment was light commercial vehicles, for which the stock approximately tripled in 2023, mainly thanks to sales in China. The stock of heavy-duty fuel cell trucks doubled. At the end of 2023, Asia accounted for over 70% of FCEVs worldwide, followed by North America with 20% and Europe with less than 10%. Korea is the leading country in terms of FCEV stock, accounting for almost 40% of all FCEVs, mainly due to its large passenger car fleet (exceeding 33 000). The United States is home to 18 200 FCEVs, almost all of which are fuel cell cars. The United States has the second-largest fuel cell car stock worldwide, with around 30% of the global stock. However, in 2023, China became home to the second-largest FCEV fleet, overtaking the United States, and constituting over 20% of the total FCEV stock. \n\nDespite having fewer than 800 fuel cell cars, China has the largest fleet across all other segments. It accounts for around 95% of medium- and heavy-duty fuel cell trucks, 90% of fuel cell LCVs, and just over 80% of fuel cell buses.

In many cases, personal cars are not the most common means of passenger transport, especially compared with shared vans and minibuses, or two- and threewheelers (2/3Ws), which are more prevalent and more often electrified, given their relative accessibility and affordability. The electrification of 2/3Ws and public or shared mobility will be key to achieve emissions reductions in such cases (see later sections in this report). While switching from internal combustion engine (ICE) to electric cars is important, the effect on overall emissions differs depending on the mode of transport that is displaced. Replacing 2/3Ws, public and shared mobility or more active forms of transport with personal cars may not be desirable in all cases. In India, electric car registrations were up 70% year-on-year to 80 000, compared to a growth rate of under 10% for total car sales. Around 2% of all cars sold were electric. Purchase incentives under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME II) scheme, supply-side incentives under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, tax benefits and the Go Electric campaign have all contributed to fostering demand in recent years. A number of new models also became popular in 2023, such as Mahindra's XUV400, MG's Comet, Citroën's eC3, BYD's Yuan Plus, and Hyundai's Ioniq 5, driving up growth compared to 2022.

{"doc_id": 425, "text": "However, if the forthcoming FAME III scheme includes a subsidy reduction, as has been speculated in line with lower subsidy levels in the 2024 budget, future growth could be affected. Local carmakers have thus far maintained a strong foothold in the market, supported by advantageous import tariffs, and account for 80% of electric car sales in cumulative terms since 2010, led by Tata (70%) and Mahindra (10%). In Thailand, electric car registrations more than quadrupled year-on-year to nearly 90 000, reaching a notable 10% sales share - comparable to the share in the United States. This is all the more impressive given that overall car sales in the country decreased from 2022 to 2023. New subsidies, including for domestic battery manufacturing, and lower import and excise taxes, combined with the growing presence of Chinese carmakers, have contributed to rapidly increasing sales. Chinese companies account for over half the sales to date, and they could become even more prominent given that BYD plans to start operating EV \nproduction facilities in Thailand in 2024, with an annual production capacity of 150 000 vehicles for an investment of just under USD 500 million. Thailand aims to become a major EV manufacturing hub for domestic and export markets, and is aiming to attract USD 28 billion in foreign investment within 4 years, backed by specific incentives to foster investment. \n\nIn Viet Nam, after an exceptional 2022 for the overall car market, car sales contracted by 25% in 2023, but electric car sales still recorded unprecedented growth: from under 100 in 2021, to 7 000 in 2022, and over 30 000 in 2023, reaching a 15% sales share. Domestic front-runner VinFast, established in 2017, accounted for nearly all domestic sales. VinFast also started selling electric sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in North America in 2023, as well as developing manufacturing facilities in order to unlock domestic content-linked subsidies under the US IRA. VinFast is investing around USD 2 billion and targets an annual production of 150 000 vehicles in the United States by 2025. The company went public in 2023, far exceeding expectations with a debut market valuation of around USD 85 billion, well beyond General Motors (GM) (USD 46 billion), Ford \n(USD 48 billion) or BMW (USD 68 billion), before it settled back down around USD 20 billion by the end of the year. VinFast also looks to enter regional markets, such as India and the Philippines. In Malaysia, electric car registrations more than tripled to 10 000, supported by tax breaks and import duty exemptions, as well as an acceleration in charging infrastructure roll-out. In 2023, Mercedes-Benz marketed the first domestically assembled EV, and both BYD and Tesla also entered the market. \n\nIn Latin America, electric car sales reached almost 90 000 in 2023, with markets in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico leading the region. In Brazil, electric car registrations nearly tripled year-on-year to more than 50 000, a market share of 3%. Growth in Brazil was underpinned by the entry of Chinese carmakers, such as BYD with its Song and Dolphin models, Great Wall with its H6, and Chery with its Tiggo 8, which immediately ranked among the best-selling models in 2023. \n\nRoad transport electrification in Brazil could bring significant climate benefits given the largely low-emissions power mix, as well as reducing local air pollution.

{"doc_id": 426, "text": "However, EV adoption has been slow thus far, given the national prioritisation of ethanol-based fuels since the late 1970s as a strategy to maintain energy security in the face of oil shocks. Today, biofuels are important alternative fuels available at competitive cost and aligned with the existing refuelling infrastructure. Brazil remains the world's largest producer of sugar cane, and its agribusiness represents about one-fourth of GDP. At the end of 2023, Brazil launched the Green Mobility and Innovation Programme, which provides tax incentives for companies to develop and manufacture low-emissions road transport technology, aggregating to more than BRA 19 billion (Brazilian reals) (USD 3.8 billion) over the 2024-2028 period. Several major carmakers already in Brazil are developing hybrid ethanol-electric models as a result. China's BYD and Great Wall are also planning to start domestic manufacturing, counting on local battery metal deposits, and plan to sell both fully electric and hybrid ethanol-electric models. BYD is investing over USD 600 million in its electric car plant in Brazil - its first outside Asia - for an annual capacity of 150 000 vehicles. BYD also partnered with Raízen to develop charging infrastructure in eight Brazilian cities starting in 2024. GM, on the other hand, plans to stop producing ICE (including ethanol) models and go fully electric, notably to produce for export markets. In 2024, Hyundai announced investments of USD 1.1 billion to 2032 to start local manufacturing of electric, hybrid and hydrogen cars. \n\nIn Mexico, electric car registrations were up 80% year-on-year to 15 000, a market share just above 1%. Given its proximity to the United States, Mexico's automotive market is already well integrated with North American partners, and benefits from advantageous trade agreements, large existing manufacturing capacity, and eligibility for subsidies under the IRA. As a result, local EV supply chains are developing quickly, with expectations that this will spill over into domestic markets. \n\nTesla, Ford, Stellantis, BMW, GM, Volkswagen (VW) and Audi have all either started manufacturing or announced plans to manufacture EVs in Mexico. \n\nChinese carmakers such as BYD, Chery and SAIC are also considering expanding to Mexico. Elsewhere in the region, Colombia and Costa Rica are seeing increasing electric car sales, with around 6 000 and 5 000 in 2023, respectively, but sales remain limited in other Central and South American countries. \n\nThroughout Africa, Eurasia and the Middle East, electric cars are still rare, accounting for less than 1% of total car sales. However, as Chinese carmakers look for opportunities abroad, new models - including those produced domestically - could boost EV sales. For example, in Uzbekistan, BYD set up a joint venture with UzAuto Motors in 2023 to produce 50 000 electric cars annually, and Chery International established a partnership with ADM Jizzakh. This partnership has already led to a steep increase in electric car sales in Uzbekistan, reaching around 10 000 in 2023. In the Middle East, Jordan boasts the highest electric car sales share, at more than 45%, supported by much lower import duties relative to ICE cars, followed by the United Arab Emirates, with 13%.\n\nUntil 2019, annual electric car sales in Indonesia were below 100, increasing tenfold to under 1 000 in 2020-2021. In 2022, annual sales jumped to over 10 000, and in 2023 they reached 17 000, supported by purchase incentives. Electric cars benefit from a reduced Value-Added Tax of 1% (compared to 11% for conventional cars), are exempt from the luxury tax that applies to many vehicles, and from import tax, and are eligible for regional tax reductions. \n\nIncreasing model availability is also helping boost sales. As in many other countries in the region, foreign carmakers - especially Chinese - are increasingly entering the market. Chinese companies accounted for 75% of electric car sales in 2022, and 45% in 2023. For example, Wuling's Air EV, which is competitively priced relative to conventional cars, at around IDR 220 million (Indonesian rupiah) (USD 14 000), has become a best-seller. Other best-selling models, such as Toyota's Kijang at IDR 420 million (USD 25 000) or Hyundai's Ioniq at IDR 670 million (USD 42 000), remain more expensive than conventional equivalents, appealing to a pool of wealthier early adopters.

{"doc_id": 427, "text": "In 2023, in order to promote domestic manufacturing, the government of Indonesia limited purchase incentives to models meeting local content requirements of 40%. As of 2023, only two models (Hyundai's Ioniq and Wuling's Air) met this criteria, which, alongside rising interest rates for credit-backed car purchases, may have hampered growth. In 2023, sales fell short of the government's target of subsidising 36 000 electric cars, and at the end of the year, local content requirements were relaxed until 2026. As a result, international companies are now setting up manufacturing facilities in the country, such as BYD and VinFast, both expected in 2024. Available BYD models will be priced at IDR 400 million (USD 25 000), and VinFast at IDR 250 million (USD 16 000). BYD plans to invest USD 1.3 billion in manufacturing facilities with an annual capacity of 150 000 cars, and VinFast to assemble 50 000 cars a year. Electric buses and 2/3Ws have not yet experienced the same success. In 2023, Indonesia's 100 electric buses were primarily concentrated in Jakarta, and imported from China; the provincial government aims to add another 200 in 2024.\n\nElectric 2/3W sales reached about 11 500 in 2023, well below the government target to subsidise 200 000. Factors limiting 2/3W uptake include low ranges and lack of charging points to enable interurban journeys. \n\nLooking forward, Indonesia aims to have 2 million electric cars and 13 million electric 2/3Ws on the road by 2030. The new capital city will mandate EVs as the main means of transportation. Battery manufacturing capacity is also ramping up, capitalising on rich nickel reserves. In 2024, Indonesia announced a joint venture between Hyundai, LG Energy Solution, and Indonesia Battery Corporation, as part of a IDR 140 trillion (USD 9.8 billion) public support package. \n\nElectric car sales remained strong in the first quarter of 2024, surpassing those of the same period in 2023 by around 25% to reach more than 3 million. This growth rate was similar to the increase observed for the same period in 2023 compared to 2022. The majority of the additional sales came from China, which sold about half a million more electric cars than over the same period in 2023. In relative terms, the most substantial growth was observed outside of the major EV markets, where sales increased by over 50%, suggesting that the transition to electromobility is picking up in an increasing number of countries worldwide.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 428, "text": "Quarterly electric car sales, 2021-2024 From January to March of this year, nearly 1.9 million electric cars were sold in China, marking an almost 35% increase compared to sales in the first quarter of 2023. In March, NEV sales in China surpassed a share of 40% in overall car sales for the first time, according to retail sales reported by the China Passenger Car Association. As witnessed in 2023, sales of plug-in hybrid electric cars are growing faster than sales of pure battery electric cars. Plug-in hybrid electric car sales in the first quarter increased by around 75% year-on-year in China, compared to just 15% for battery electric car sales, though the former started from a lower base. In Europe, the first quarter of 2024 saw year-on-year growth of over 5%, slightly above the growth in overall car sales and thereby stabilising the EV sales share at a similar level as last year. Electric car sales growth was particularly high in Belgium, where around 60 000 electric cars were sold, almost 35% more than the year before. However, Belgium represents less than 5% of total European car sales. In the major European markets - France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom (together representing about 60% of European car sales) - \ngrowth in electric car sales was lower. In France, overall EV sales in the first quarter grew by about 15%, with BEV sales growth being higher than for PHEVs. While this is less than half the rate as over the same period last year, total sales were nonetheless higher and led to a slight increase in the share of EVs in total car sales. The United Kingdom saw similar year-on-year growth (over 15%) in EV \nsales as France, about the same rate as over the same period last year. In Germany, where battery electric car subsidies ended in 2023, sales of electric cars fell by almost 5% in the first quarter of 2024, mainly as a result of a 20% year-onyear decrease in March. The share of EVs in total car sales was therefore slightly lower than last year. As in China, PHEV sales in both Germany and the United Kingdom were stronger than BEV sales. In Italy, sales of electric cars in the first three months of 2024 were more than 20% lower than over the same period in 2023, with the majority of the decrease taking place in the PHEV \nsegment. However, this trend could be reversed based on the introduction of a new incentive scheme, and if Chinese automaker Chery succeeds in appealing to Italian consumers when it enters the market later this year. In the United States, first-quarter sales reached around 350 000, almost 15% \nhigher than over the same period the year before. As in other major markets, the sales growth of PHEVs was even higher, at 50%. While the BEV sales share in the United States appears to have fallen somewhat over the past few months, the sales share of PHEVs has grown.\n\nIn smaller EV markets, sales growth in the first months of 2024 was much higher, albeit from a low base. In January and February, electric car sales almost quadrupled in Brazil and increased more than sevenfold in Viet Nam. In India, sales increased more than 50% in the first quarter of 2024. These figures suggest that EVs are gaining momentum across diverse markets worldwide. Since 2021, first-quarter electric car sales have typically accounted for 15-20% of the total global annual sales. Based on this observed trend, coupled with policy momentum and the seasonality that EV sales typically experience, we estimate that electric car sales could reach around 17 million in 2024. This indicates robust growth for a maturing market, with 2024 sales to surpass those of 2023 by more than 20% and EVs to reach a share in total car sales of more than one-fifth. \n\nThe majority of the additional 3 million electric car sales projected for 2024 relative to 2023 are from China. Despite the phase-out of NEV purchase subsidies last year, sales in China have remained robust, indicating that the market is maturing. \n\nWith strong competition and relatively low-cost electric cars, sales are to grow by almost 25% in 2024 compared to last year, reaching around 10 million. If confirmed, this figure will come close to the total global electric car sales in 2022. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 429, "text": "As a result, electric car sales could represent around 45% of total car sales in China over 2024. In 2024, electric car sales in the United States are projected to rise by 20% \ncompared to the previous year, translating to almost half a million more sales, relative to 2023. Despite reporting of a rocky end to 2023 for electric cars in the United States, sales shares are projected to remain robust in 2024. Over the entire year, around one in nine cars sold are expected to be electric.\n\nBased on recent trends, and considering that tightening CO2 targets are due to come in only in 2025, the growth in electric car sales in Europe is expected to be the lowest of the three largest markets. Sales are projected to reach around 3.5 million units in 2024, reflecting modest growth of less than 10% compared to the previous year. In the context of a generally weak outlook for passenger car sales, electric cars would still represent about one in four cars sold in Europe. \n\nOutside of the major EV markets, electric car sales are anticipated to reach the milestone of over 1 million units in 2024, marking a significant increase of over 40% compared to 2023. Recent trends showing the success of both homegrown and Chinese electric carmakers in Southeast Asia underscore that the region is set to make a strong contribution to the sales of emerging EV markets (see the section on Trends in the electric vehicle industry). Despite some uncertainty surrounding whether India's forthcoming FAME III scheme will include subsidies for electric cars, we expect sales in India to remain robust, and to experience around 50% growth compared to 2023. Across all regions outside the three major EV markets, electric car sales are expected to represent around 5% of total car sales in 2024, which - considering the high growth rates seen in recent years - could indicate that a tipping point towards global mass adoption is getting closer. There are of course downside risks to the 2024 outlook for electric car sales. \n\nFactors such as high interest rates and economic uncertainty could potentially reduce the growth of global electric car sales in 2024. Other challenges may come from the IRA restrictions on US electric car tax incentives, and the tightening of technical requirements for EVs to qualify for the purchase tax exemption in China. \n\nHowever, there are also upside potentials to consider. New markets may open up more rapidly than anticipated, as automakers expand their EV operations and new entrants compete for market share. This could lead to accelerated growth in electric car sales globally, surpassing the initial estimations. \n\nMore electric models are becoming available, but the trend is towards larger ones The number of available electric car models nears 600, twothirds of which are large vehicles and SUVs In 2023, the number of available models for electric cars increased 15% year-onyear to nearly 590, as carmakers scaled up electrification plans, seeking to appeal to a growing consumer base. Meanwhile, the number of fully ICE models \n(i.e. excluding hybrids) declined for the fourth consecutive year, at an average of 2%. Based on recent original equipment manufacturer (OEM) announcements, the number of new electric car models could reach 1 000 by 2028. If all announced new electric models actually reach the market, and if the number of available ICE \ncar models continues to decline by 2% annually, there could be as many electric as ICE car models before 2030. \n\nICE cars Electric cars Share of SUVs and large models among electric cars (right)\nCar model availability by powertrain over 2010-2023 and in 2028 based on announced launches, and share of SUVs and large models among electric cars IEA.

{"doc_id": 430, "text": "As reported in GEVO-2023, the share of small and medium electric car models is decreasing among available electric models: in 2023, two-thirds of the batteryelectric models on the market were SUVs, 5 pick-up trucks or large cars. Just 25% \nof battery electric car sales in the United States were for small and medium models, compared to 40% in Europe and 50% in China. Electric cars are following the same trend as conventional cars, and getting bigger on average. In 2023, SUVs, pick-up trucks and large models accounted for 65% of total ICE car sales worldwide, and more than 80% in the United States, 60% in China and 50% in Europe. Several factors underpin the increase in the share of large models. Since the 2010s, conventional SUVs in the United States have benefited from less stringent tailpipe emissions rules than smaller models, creating an incentive for carmakers to market more vehicles in that segment. Similarly, in the European Union, CO2 targets for passenger cars have included a compromise on weight, allowing CO2 leeway for heavier vehicles in some cases. Larger vehicles also mean larger margins for carmakers. Given that incumbent carmakers are not yet making a profit on their EV offer in many cases, focusing on larger models enables them to increase their margins. Under the US IRA, electric SUVs can qualify for tax credits as long as they are priced under USD 80 000, whereas the limit stands at USD 55 000 for a sedan, creating an incentive to market SUVs if a greater margin can be gathered. On the demand side, there is now strong willingness to pay for SUVs or large models. Consumers are typically interested in longer-range and larger cars for their primary vehicles, even though small models are more suited to urban use. Higher marketing spend on SUVs compared to smaller models can also have an impact on consumer choices. \n\nThe progressive shift towards ICE SUVs has been dramatically limiting fuel savings. Over the 2010-2022 period, without the shift to SUVs, energy use per kilometre could have fallen at an average annual rate 30% higher than the actual rate. Switching to electric in the SUV and larger car segments can therefore achieve immediate and significant CO2 emissions reductions, and electrification also brings considerable benefits in terms of reducing air pollution and non-tailpipe emissions, especially in urban settings. In 2023, if all ICE and HEV sales of SUVs had instead been BEV, around 770 Mt CO2 could have been avoided globally over the cars' lifetimes (see section 10 on lifecycle analysis). This is equivalent to the total road emissions of China in 2023. \n\nBreakdown of battery electric car sales in selected countries and regions **by car size,** \n2018-2023 Nevertheless, from a policy perspective, it is critical to mitigate the negative spillovers associated with an increase in larger electric cars in the fleet. \n\nLarger electric car models have a significant impact on battery supply chains and critical mineral demand. In 2023, the sales-weighted average battery electric SUV in Europe had a battery almost twice as large as the one in the average small electric car, with a proportionate impact on critical mineral needs. Of course, the range of small cars is typically shorter than SUVs and large cars (see later section on ranges). However, when comparing electric SUVs and medium-sized electric cars, which in 2023 offered a similar range, the SUV battery was still 25% larger. \n\nThis means that if all electric SUVs sold in 2023 had instead been medium-sized cars, around 60 GWh of battery equivalent could have been avoided globally, with limited impact on range. Accounting for the different chemistries used in China, Europe, and the United States, this would be equivalent to almost 6 000 tonnes of lithium, 30 000 tonnes of nickel, almost 7 000 tonnes of cobalt, and over 8 000 tonnes of manganese. \n\nLarger manganese also require more power, or longer charging times. This can put pressure on electricity grids and charging infrastructure by increasing occupancy, which could create issues during peak utilisation, such as at highway charging points at high traffic times. In addition, larger vehicles also require greater quantities of materials such as iron and steel, aluminium and plastics, with a higher environmental and carbon footprint for materials production, processing and assembly. Because they are heavier, larger models also have higher electricity consumption. The additional energy consumption resulting from the increased mass is mitigated by regenerative braking to some extent, but in 2022, the sales-weighted average electricity consumption of electric SUVs was 20% higher than that of other electric cars.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 431, "text": "Breakdown of available car models and expected new launches by powertrain and segment in selected countries and regions, 2023-2028 Several governments have responded by introducing policies to create incentives for smaller and lighter passenger cars. In Norway, for example, all cars are subject to a purchase tax based on weight, CO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, though electric cars were exempt from the weight-based tax prior to 2023. Any imported cars weighing more than 500 kg must also pay an entry fee for each additional kg. In France, a progressive weight-based tax applies to ICE and PHEV \ncars weighing above 1 600 kg, with a significant impact on price: weight tax for a Land Rover Defender 130 (2 550 kg) adds up to more than EUR 21 500, versus zero for a Renault Clio (1 100 kg). Battery electric cars have been exempted to date. In February 2024, a referendum held in Paris resulted in a tripling of city parking fees for visiting SUVs, applicable to ICE, hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars above 1 600 kg and battery electric ones above 2 000 kg, in an effort to limit the use of large and/or polluting vehicles. Other examples exist in Estonia, Finland, Switzerland and the Netherlands. A number of policy options may be used, such as caps and fleet averages for vehicle footprint, weight, and/or battery size; access to finance for smaller vehicles; and sustained support for public charging, enabling wider use of shorter-range cars.\n\nConcerns about range compared to ICE vehicles, and about the availability of charging infrastructure for long-distance journeys, also contribute to increasing appetite for larger models with longer range. \n\nWith increasing battery size and improvements in battery technology and vehicle design, the sales-weighted average range of battery electric cars grew by nearly 75% between 2015 and 2023, although trends vary by segment. The average range of small cars in 2023 - around 150 km - is not much higher than it was in 2015, indicating that this range is already well suited for urban use (with the exception of taxis, which have much higher daily usage). Large, higher-end models already offered higher ranges than average in 2015, and their range has stagnated through 2023, averaging around 360-380 km. Meanwhile, significant improvements have been made for medium-sized cars and SUVs, the range of which now stands around 380 km, whereas it averaged around 150 km for medium cars and 270 km for SUVs in 2015. This is encouraging for consumers looking to purchase an electric car for longer journeys rather than urban use. \n\nSince 2020, growth in the average range of vehicles has been slower than over the 2015-2020 period. This could result from a number of factors, including fluctuating battery prices, carmakers' attempts to limit additional costs as competition intensifies, and technical constraints (e.g. energy density, battery size). It could also reflect that beyond a certain range at which most driving needs are met, consumers' willingness to pay for a marginal increase in battery size and range is limited. Looking forward, however, the average range could start increasing again as novel battery technologies mature and prices fall. \n\nAn equitable and inclusive transition to electric mobility, both within countries and at the global level, hinges on the successful launch of affordable EVs (including but not limited to electric cars). In this section, we use historic sales and price data for electric and ICE models around the world to examine the total cost of owning an electric car, price trends over time, and the remaining electric premium, by country and vehicle size.\n\nCar purchase decisions typically involve consideration of retail price and available subsidies as well as lifetime operating costs, such as fuel costs, insurance, maintenance and depreciation, which together make up the total cost of ownership\n(TCO). Reaching TCO parity between electric and ICE cars creates important financial incentives to make the switch. This section examines the different components of the TCO, by region and car size. In 2023, upfront retail prices for electric cars were generally higher than for their ICE equivalents, which increased their TCO in relative terms. On the upside, higher fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs enable fuel cost savings for electric cars, lowering their TCO. This is especially true in periods when fuel prices are high, in places where electricity prices are not too closely correlated to fossil fuel prices. Depreciation is also a major factor in determining TCO: As a car ages, it loses value, and depreciation for electric cars tends to be faster than for ICE equivalents, further increasing their TCO. Accelerated depreciation could, however, prove beneficial for the development of second-hand markets. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 432, "text": "However, the trend towards faster depreciation for electric vehicles might be reversed for multiple reasons. Firstly, consumers are gaining more confidence in electric battery lifetimes, thereby increasing the resale value of EVs. Secondly, strong demand and the positive brand image of some BEV models can mean they hold their value longer, as shown by Tesla models depreciating more slowly than the average petrol car in the United States. Finally, increasing fuel prices in some regions, the roll-out of low-emissions zones that restrict access for the most polluting vehicles, and taxes and parking fees specifically targeted at ICE vehicles could mean they experience faster depreciation rates than EVs in the future. In light of these two possible opposing depreciation trends, the same fixed annual depreciation rate for both BEVs and ICE vehicles has been applied in the following cost of ownership analysis.\n\nSubsidies help lower the TCO of electric cars relative to ICE equivalents in multiple ways. A purchase subsidy lowers the original retail price, thereby lowering capital depreciation over time, and a lower retail price implies lower financing costs through cumulative interest. Subsidies can significantly reduce the number of years required to reach TCO parity between electric and ICE equivalents. As of 2022, we estimate that TCO parity could be reached in most cases in under 7 years in the three major EV markets, with significant variations across different car sizes. In comparison, for models purchased at 2018 prices, TCO parity was much harder to achieve.\n\nDifference in total cost of ownership for a battery electric vehicle **and a conventional** \nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nNotes: TCO = total cost of ownership; SUV = sports utility vehicle. First owner cumulative cost of ownership with depreciation considered. Incentives include subsidies, vehicle purchase tax exemptions and tax credits. All calculation assumptions are listed in Table 1 located in the general annex of this document.\n\nSources: IEA analysis based on IHS Markit data for sales-weighted average upfront purchase prices. \n\nIn Germany, for example, we estimate that the sales-weighted average price of a medium-sized battery electric car in 2022 was 10-20% more expensive than its ICE equivalent, but 10-20% cheaper in cumulative costs of ownership after 5 years, thanks to fuel and maintenance costs savings. In the case of an electric SUV, we estimate that the average annual operating cost savings would amount to USD 1 800 when compared to the equivalent conventional SUV over a period of 10 years. In the United States, despite lower fuel prices with respect to electricity, the higher average annual mileage results in savings that are close to Germany at USD 1 600 per year. In China, lower annual distance driven reduces fuel cost savings potential, but the very low price of electricity enables savings of about USD 1 000 per year. These figures provide an indication of how long it would take to recoup the initial purchase price gap between a BEV and its equivalent ICEV through operating cost savings. In EMDEs, some electric cars can also be cheaper than ICE equivalents over their lifetime. This is true in India, for example, although it depends on the financing instrument. Access to finance is typically much more challenging in EMDEs due to higher interest rates and the more limited availability of cheap capital. \n\nPassenger cars have also a significantly lower market penetration in the first place, and many car purchases are made in second-hand markets. Later sections of this report look at markets for used electric cars, as well as the TCO for electric and conventional 2/3Ws in EMDEs, where they are far more widespread than cars as a means of road transport.\n\nAchieving price parity between electric and ICE cars will be an important tipping point. Even when the TCO for electric cars is advantageous, the upfront retail price plays a decisive role, and mass-market consumers are typically more sensitive to price premiums than wealthier buyers. This holds true not only in emerging and developing economies, which have comparatively high costs of capital and comparatively low household and business incomes, but also in advanced economies. In the United States, for example, surveys suggest affordability was the top concern for consumers considering EV adoption in 2023. Other estimates show that even among SUV and pick-up truck consumers, only 50% would be willing to purchase one above USD 50 000. In this section, we examine historic price trends for electric and ICE cars over the 2018-2022 period, by country and car size, and for best-selling models in 2023. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 433, "text": "Electric cars are generally getting cheaper as battery prices drop, competition intensifies, and carmakers achieve economies of scale. In most cases, however, they remain on average more expensive than ICE equivalents. In some cases, after adjusting for inflation, their price stagnated or even moderately increased between 2018 and 2022. Larger batteries for longer ranges increase car prices, and so too do the additional options, equipment, digital technology and luxury features that are often marketed on top of the base model. A disproportionate focus on larger, premium models is pushing up the average price, which - added to the lack of available models in second-hand markets (see below) - limits potential to reach mass-market consumers. Importantly, geopolitical tension, trade and supply chain disruptions, increasing battery prices in 2022 relative to 2021, and rising inflation, have also significantly affected the potential for further cost declines.\n\nCompetition can also play an important role in bringing down electric car prices. Intensifying competition leads carmakers to cut prices to the minimum profit margin they can sustain, and - if needed - to do so more quickly than battery and production costs decline. For example, between mid-2022 and early-2024, Tesla cut the price of its Model Y from between USD 65 000 and USD 70 000 to between USD 45 000 and USD 55 000 in the United States. Battery prices for such a model dropped by only USD 3 000 over the same period in the United States, suggesting that a profit margin may still be made at a lower price. Similarly, in China, the price of the Base Model Y dropped from CNY 320 000 (Yuan renminbi) (USD 47 000) to CNY 250 000 (USD 38 000), while the corresponding battery price fell by only USD 1 000. Conversely, in cases where electric models remain niche or aimed at wealthier, less price-sensitive early adopters, their price may not fall as quickly as battery prices, if carmakers can sustain greater margins.\n\nSources: IEA analysis based on data from IHS Markit, EV Volumes, Marklines and various sources for retail prices.\nPrice gap between the sales-weighted average price of conventional and electric cars in selected countries, before subsidy, by size, 2018 and 2022\n\nIn China, where the sales share of electric cars has been high for several years, the sales-weighted average price of electric cars (before purchase subsidy) is already lower than that of ICE cars. This is true not only when looking at total sales, but also at the small cars segment, and is close for SUVs. After accounting for the EV exemption from the 10% vehicle purchase tax, electric SUVs were already on par with conventional ones in 2022, on average. \n\nElectric car prices have dropped significantly since 2018. We estimate that around 55% of the electric cars sold in China in 2022 were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent, up from under 10% in 2018. Given the further price declines between 2022 and 2023, we estimate that this share increased to around 65% in 2023. These encouraging trends suggest that price parity between electric and ICE cars could also be reached in other countries in certain segments by 2030, if the sales share of electric cars continues to grow, and if supporting infrastructure - such as for charging - is sustained.\n\nAs reported in detail in GEVO-2023, China remains a global exception in terms of available inexpensive electric models. Local carmakers already market nearly 50 small, affordable electric car models, many of which are priced under CNY 100 000 (USD 15 000). This is in the same range as best-selling small ICE \ncars in 2023, which cost from CNY 70 000 to CNY 100 000. In 2022, the bestselling electric car was SAIC's small Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, which accounted for 10% of all BEV sales. It was priced around CNY 40 000, weighing under 700 kg for a 170-km range. In 2023, however, it was overtaken by Tesla models, among other larger models, as new consumers seek longer ranges and higher-end options and digital equipment. \n\nShare of battery electric car sales in China that are more or less expensive than ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 434, "text": "In the United States, the sales-weighted average price of electric cars decreased over the 2018-2022 period, primarily driven by a considerable drop in the price of Tesla cars, which account for a significant share of sales. The sales-weighted average retail price of electric SUVs fell slightly more quickly than the average SUV battery costs over the same period. The average price of small and medium models also decreased, albeit to a smaller extent. Across all segments, electric models remained more expensive than conventional equivalents in 2022. However, the gap has since begun to close, as market size increases and competition leads carmakers to cut prices. For example, in 20232024, Tesla's Model 3 could be found in the USD 39 000 to USD 42 000 range, which is comparable to the average price for new ICE cars, and a new Model Y \npriced under USD 50 000 was launched. Rivian is expecting to launch its R2 SUV \nin 2026 at USD 45 000, which is much less than previous vehicles. Average price parity between electric and conventional SUVs could be reached by 2030, but it may only be reached later for small and medium cars, given their lower availability and popularity. Smaller, cheaper electric models have further to go to reach price parity in the United States. We estimate that in 2022, only about 5% of the electric cars sold in the United States were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent. In 2023, the cheapest electric cars were priced around USD 30 000 (e.g. Chevrolet Bolt, Nissan Leaf, Mini Cooper SE). To compare, best-selling small ICE options cost under USD 20 000 (e.g. Kia Rio, Mitsubishi Mirage), and many best-selling medium ICE options between USD 20 000 and USD 25 000 (e.g. Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Kia Forte, Hyundai Avante, Nissan Sentra). \n\nAround 25 new all-electric car models are expected in 2024, but only 5 of them are expected below USD 50 000, and none under the USD 30 000 mark. \n\nConsidering all the electric models expected to be available in 2024, about 75% \nare priced above USD 50 000, and fewer than 10 under USD 40 000, even after taking into account the USD 7 500 tax credit under the IRA for eligible cars as of February 2024. This means that despite the tax credit, few electric car models directly compete with small mass-market ICE models.\n\nNumber of available battery electric car models in the United States, by retail price after tax credit when eligible, 2023 and 2024 In December 2023, GM stopped production of its best-selling electric car, the Bolt, announcing it would introduce a new version in 2025. The Nissan Leaf (40 kWh) therefore remains the cheapest available electric car in 2024, at just under USD 30 000, but is not yet eligible for IRA tax credits. Ford announced in 2024 that it would move away from large and expensive electric cars as a way to convince more consumers to switch to electric, at the same time as increasing output of ICE models to help finance a transition to electric mobility. In 2024, Tesla announced it would start producing a next-generation, compact and affordable electric car in June 2025, but the company had already announced in 2020 that it would deliver a USD 25 000 model within 3 years. Some micro urban electric cars are already available between USD 5 000 and USD 20 000 (e.g. Arcimoto FUV, \nNimbus One), but they are rare. In theory, such models could cover many use cases, since 80% of car journeys in the United States are under 10 miles. \n\nPricing trends differ across European countries, and typically vary by segment. \n\nIn Norway, after taking into account the EV sales tax exemption, electric cars are already cheaper than ICE equivalents across all segments. In 2022, we estimate that the electric premium stood around -15%, and even -30% for medium-sized cars. Five years earlier, in 2018, the overall electric premium was less advantageous, at around -5%. The progressive reintroduction of sales taxes on electric cars may change these estimates for 2023 onwards. Germany's electric premium ranks among the lowest in the European Union.

{"doc_id": 435, "text": "Although the sales-weighted average electric premium increased slightly between 2018 and 2022, it stood at 15% in 2022. It is particularly low for medium-sized cars \n(10-15%) and SUVs (20%), but remains higher than 50% for small models. In the case of medium cars, the sales-weighted average electric premium was as low as EUR 5 000 in 2022. We estimate that in 2022, over 40% of the medium electric cars sold in Germany were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent. Looking at total sales, over 25% of the electric cars sold in 2022 were cheaper than their average ICE equivalent. In 2023, the cheapest models among the best-selling medium electric cars were priced between EUR 22 000 and EUR 35 000 (e.g. MG \nMG4, Dacia Spring, Renault Megane), far cheaper than the three front-runners priced above EUR 45 000 (VW ID.3, Cupra Born, and Tesla Model 3). To compare, best-selling ICE cars in the medium segment were also priced between EUR 30 000 and EUR 45 000 (e.g. VW Golf, VW Passat Santana, Skoda Octavia Laura, Audi A3, Audi A4). At the end of 2023, Germany phased out its subsidy for electric car purchases, but competition and falling model prices could compensate for this. \n\nRetail price of cheapest electric and conventional cars as a share of median annual household income (left) and top 10% annual household income (right), by country and In France, the sales-weighted average electric premium stagnated between 2018 and 2022. The average price of ICE cars also increased over the same period, though more moderately than that of electric models. Despite a drop in the price of electric SUVs, which stood at a 30% premium over ICE equivalents in 2022, the former do not account for a high enough share of total electric car sales to drive down the overall average. The electric premium for small and medium cars remains around 40-50%. \n\nThese trends mirror those of some of the best-selling models. For example, when adjusting prices for inflation, the small Renault Zoe was sold at the same price on average in 2022-2023 as in 2018-2019, or EUR 30 000 (USD 32 000). It could be found for sale at as low as EUR 25 000 in 2015-2016. The earlier models, in 2015, had a battery size of around 20 kWh, which increased to around 40 kWh in 2018-2019 and 50 kWh in newer models in 2022-2023. Yet European battery prices fell more quickly than the battery size increased over the same period, indicating that battery size alone does not explain car price dynamics. In 2023, the cheapest electric cars in France were priced between EUR 22 000 and EUR 30 000 (e.g. Dacia Spring, Renault Twingo E-Tech, Smart EQ Fortwo), \nwhile best-selling small ICE models were available between EUR 10 000 and EUR 20 000 (e.g. Renault Clio, Peugeot 208, Citroën C3, Dacia Sandero, Opel Corsa, Skoda Fabia). Since mid-2024, subsidies of up to EUR 4 000 can be granted for electric cars priced under EUR 47 000, with an additional subsidy of up to EUR 3 000 for lower-income households. In the United Kingdom, the sales-weighted average electric premium shrank between 2018 and 2022, thanks to a drop in prices for electric SUVs, as in the United States. Nonetheless, electric SUVs still stood at a 45% premium over ICE \nequivalents in 2022, which is similar to the premium for small models but far higher than for medium cars (20%). \n\nIn 2023, the cheapest electric cars in the United Kingdom were priced from GBP 27 000 to GBP 30 000 (USD 33 000 to 37 000) (e.g. MG MG4, Fiat 500, Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe), with the exception of the Smart EQ Fortwo, priced at GBP 21 000. To compare, best-selling small ICE options could be found from GBP 10 000 to 17 000 (e.g. Peugeot 208, Fiat 500, Dacia Sandero) and medium options below GBP 25 000 (e.g. Ford Puma). Since July 2022, there has been no subsidy for the purchase of electric passenger cars. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 436, "text": "Elsewhere in Europe, electric cars remain typically much more expensive than ICE equivalents. In Poland, for example, just a few electric car models could be found at prices competitive with ICE cars in 2023, under the PLN 150 000 (Polish zloty) (EUR 35 000) mark. Over 70% of electric car sales in 2023 were for SUVs, or large or more luxurious models, compared to less than 60% for ICE cars. In 2023, there were several announcements by European OEMs for smaller models priced under EUR 25 000 in the near-term (e.g. Renault R5, Citroën e-C3, Fiat e-Panda, VW ID.2all). There is also some appetite for urban microcars \n(i.e. L6-L7 category), learning from the success of China's Wuling. Miniature models bring important benefits if they displace conventional models, helping reduce battery and critical mineral demand. Their prices are often below USD 5 000 (e.g. Microlino, Fiat Topolino, Citroën Ami, Silence S04, Birò B2211). In Europe and the United States, electric car prices are expected to come down as a result of falling battery prices, more efficient manufacturing, and competition. Independent analyses suggest that price parity between some electric and ICE \ncar models in certain segments could be reached over the 2025-2028 period, for example for small electric cars in Europe in 2025 or soon after. However, many market variables could delay price parity, such as volatile commodity prices, supply chain bottlenecks, and the ability of carmakers to yield sufficient margins from cheaper electric models. The typical rule in which economies of scale bring down costs is being complicated by numerous other market forces. These include a dynamic regulatory context, geopolitical competition, domestic content incentives, and a continually evolving technology landscape, with competing battery chemistries that each have their own economies of scale and regional specificities. \n\nSales-weighted average price of battery electric cars, and average battery price, by \n\nJapan is a rare example of an advanced economy where small models - both for electric and ICE vehicles - appeal to a large consumer base, motivated by densely populated cities with limited parking space, and policy support. In 2023, about 60% of total ICE sales were for small models, and over half of total electric sales. Two electric cars from the smallest \"Kei\" category, the Nissan Sakura and Mitsubishi eK-X, accounted for nearly 50% of national electric car sales alone, and both are priced between JPY 2.3 million (Japanese yen) and JPY 3 million (USD 18 000 to USD 23 000). However, this is still more expensive than best-selling small ICE \ncars (e.g. Honda N Box, Daihatsu Hijet, Daihatsu Tanto, Suzuki Spacia, Daihatsu Move), priced between USD 13 000 and USD 18 000. In 2024, Nissan announced that it would aim to reach cost parity (of production, not retail price) between electric and ICE cars by 2030.\n\nIn EMDEs, the absence of small and cheaper electric car models is a significant hindrance to wider market uptake. Many of the available car models are SUVs or large models, targeting consumers of high-end goods, and far too expensive for mass-market consumers, who often do not own a personal car in the first place\n(see later sections on second-hand car markets and 2/3Ws). In India, while Tata's small Tiago/Tigor models, which are priced between USD 10 000 and USD 15 000, accounted for about 20% of total electric car sales in 2023, the average best-selling small ICE car is priced around USD 7 000. Large models and SUVs accounted for over 65% of total electric car sales. While BYD\nannounced in 2023 the goal of accounting for 40% of India's EV market by 2030, all of its models available in India cost more than INR 3 million (Indian rupees)\n(USD 37 000), including the Seal, launched in 2024 for INR 4.1 million (USD 50 000).

{"doc_id": 437, "text": "Similarly, SUVs and large models accounted for the majority share of electric car sales in Thailand (60%), Indonesia (55%), Malaysia (over 85%) and Viet Nam\n(over 95%). In Indonesia, for example, Hyundai's Ionic 5 was the most popular electric car in 2023, priced at around USD 50 000. Looking at launch announcements, most new models expected over the 2024-2028 period in EMDEs are SUVs or large models. However, more than 50 small and medium models could also be introduced, and the recent or forthcoming entry of Chinese carmakers suggests that cheaper models could hit the market in the coming years. In 2022-2023, Chinese carmakers accounted for 40-75% of the electric car sales in Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil, with sales jumping as cheaper Chinese models were introduced. In Thailand, for example, Hozon launched its Neta V model in 2022 priced at THB 550 000 (Thai baht) (USD 15 600), which became a bestseller in 2023 given its relative affordability compared with the cheapest ICE \nequivalents at around USD 9 000. Similarly, in Indonesia, the market entry of Wuling's Air EV in 2022-2023 was met with great success. In Colombia, the bestselling electric car in 2023 was the Chinese mini-car, Zhidou 2DS, which could be found at around USD 15 000, a competitive option relative to the country's cheapest ICE car, the Kia Picanto, at USD 13 000.\n\nElectric car sales in selected countries, by origin of carmaker, 2021-2023 IEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nNotes: In the case of joint ventures between international incumbent carmakers and Chinese companies, sales are distributed among countries when model-level data are available (e.g. in the case of the GM-SAIC-Wuling joint venture, Wuling models are counted as headquartered in China, not the United States).\n\nSource: IEA analysis based on data from EV Volumes.\n\nAs electric vehicle markets mature, the second-hand market will become more important In the same way as for other technology products, second-hand markets for used electric cars are now emerging as newer generations of vehicles progressively become available and earlier adopters switch or upgrade. Second-hand markets are critical to foster mass-market adoption, especially if new electric cars remain expensive, and used ones become cheaper. Just as for ICE vehicles - for which buying second-hand is often the primary method of acquiring a car in both emerging and advanced economies - a similar pattern will emerge with electric vehicles. It is estimated that eight out of ten EU citizens buy their car second-hand, and this share is even higher - around 90% - among low- and middle-income \n\nAs major electric car markets reach maturity, more and more used electric cars are becoming available for resale. Our estimates suggest that in 2023, the market size for used electric cars amounted to nearly 800 000 in China, 400 000 in the United States and more than 450 000 for France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom combined. Second-hand sales have not been included in the numbers presented in the previous section of this report, which focused on sales of new electric cars, but they are already significant. On aggregate, global second-hand electric car sales were roughly equal to new electric car sales in the United States in 2023. In the United States, used electric car sales are set to increase by 40% in 2024 relative to 2023. Of course, these volumes are dwarfed by second-hand ICE markets: 30 million in the European countries listed above combined, nearly 20 million in China, and 36 million in the United States. However, these markets have had decades to mature, indicating greater longer-term potential for used electric car markets. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 438, "text": "Used car markets already provide more affordable electric options in China, Europe and the United States Second-hand car markets are increasingly becoming a source of more affordable electric cars that can compete with used ICE equivalents. In the United States, for example, more than half of second-hand electric cars are already priced below USD 30 000. Moreover, the average price is expected to quickly fall towards USD 25 000, the price at which used electric cars become eligible for the federal used car rebate of USD 4 000, making them directly competitive with best-selling new and used ICE options. The price of a second-hand Tesla in the United States dropped from over USD 50 000 in early 2023 to just above USD 33 000 in early 2024, making it competitive with a second-hand SUV and many new models as well (either electric or conventional). In Europe, second-hand battery electric cars can be found between EUR 15 000 and EUR 25 000 (USD 16 000-27 000), and second-hand plug-in hybrids around EUR 30 000 (USD 32 000). Some European countries also offer subsidies for second-hand electric cars, such as the Netherlands (EUR 2 000), where the subsidy for new cars has been steadily declining since 2020, while that for used cars remains constant, and France (EUR 1 000). In China, used electric cars were priced around CNY 75 000 on average in 2023 (USD 11 000). \n\nIn recent years, the resale value8 of electric cars has been increasing. In Europe, the resale value of battery electric cars sold after 12 months has steadily increased over the 2017-2022 period, surpassing that of all other powertrains and standing at more than 70% in mid-2022. The resale value of battery electric cars sold after 36 months stood below 40% in 2017, but has since been closing the gap with other powertrains, reaching around 55% in mid-2022. This is the result of many factors, including higher prices of new electric cars, improving technology allowing vehicles and batteries to retain greater value over time, and increasing demand for second-hand electric cars. Similar trends have been observed in China.\n\nHigh or low resale values have important implications for the development of second-hand electric car markets and their contributions to the transition to road transport electrification. High resale values primarily benefit consumers of new cars (who retain more of the value of their initial purchase), and carmakers, because many consumers are attracted by the possibility of reselling their car after a few years, thereby fostering demand for newer models. High resale values also benefit leasing companies, which seek to minimise depreciation and resell after a few years. \n\nLeasing companies have a significant impact on second-hand markets because they own large volumes of vehicles for a shorter period (under three years, compared to 3 to 5 years for a private household). Their impact on markets for new cars can also be considerable: leasing companies accounted for over 20% of new cars sold in Europe in 2022. Overall, a resale value for electric cars on par with or higher than that of ICE \nequivalents contributes to supporting demand for new electric cars. In the near term, however, a combination of high prices for new electric cars and high resale values could hinder widespread adoption of used EVs among mass-market consumers seeking affordable cars. In such cases, policy support can help bridge the gap with second-hand ICE prices. \n\nDifference between the relative resale value of battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles **compared to gasoline conventional cars, 2023**\nInternational trade for used electric cars to emerging markets is expected to increase As the EV stock ages in advanced markets, it is likely that more and more used EVs will be traded internationally, assuming that global standards enable technology compatibility (e.g. for charging infrastructure). Imported used vehicles present an opportunity for consumers in EMDEs, who may not have access to new models because they are either too expensive or not marketed in their countries.

{"doc_id": 439, "text": "Data on used car trade flows are scattered and often contradictory, but the history of ICE cars can be a useful guide to what may happen for electric cars. Many EMDEs have been importing used ICE vehicles for decades. UNEP estimates that Africa imports 40% of all used vehicles exported worldwide, with African countries typically becoming the ultimate destination for used imports. Typical trade flows include Western European Union member states to Eastern European Union member states and to African countries that drive on the right-hand side; Japan to Asia and to African countries that drive on the left-hand side; and the United States to the Middle East and Central America. Used electric car exports from large EV markets have been growing in recent years. For China, this can be explained by the recent roll-back of a policy forbidding exports of used vehicles of any kind. Since 2019, as part of a pilot project, the government has granted 27 cities and provinces the right to export second-hand cars. In 2022, China exported almost 70 000 used vehicles, a significant increase on 2021, when fewer than 20 000 vehicles were exported. \n\nAbout 70% of these were NEVs, of which over 45% were exported to the Middle East. In 2023, the Ministry of Commerce released a draft policy on second-hand vehicle export that, once approved, will allow the export of second-hand vehicles from all regions of China. Used car exports from China are expected to increase significantly as a result. \n\nIn the European Union, the number of used electric cars traded internationally is also increasing. In both 2021 and 2022, the market size grew by 70% year-onyear, reaching almost 120 000 electric cars in 2022. More than half of all trade takes place between EU member states, followed by trade with neighbouring countries such as Norway, the United Kingdom and Türkiye (accounting for 20% \ncombined). The remainder of used EVs are exported to countries such as Mexico, Tunisia and the United States. As of 2023, the largest exporters are Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain. Last year, just over 1% of all used cars leaving Japan were electric. However these exports are growing and increased by 30% in 2023 relative to 2022, reaching 20 000 cars. The major second-hand electric car markets for Japanese vehicles are traditionally Russia and New Zealand (over 60% combined). After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, second-hand trade of conventional cars from Japan to Russia jumped sharply following a halt in operations of local OEMs in Russia, but this trade was quickly restricted by the Japanese government, thereby bringing down the price of second-hand cars in Japan. New Zealand has very few local vehicle assembly or manufacturing facilities, and for this reason many cars entering New Zealand are used imports. In 2023, nearly 20% of all electric cars that entered New Zealand were used imports, compared to 50% for the overall car market. In emerging economies, local policies play an important role in promoting or limiting trade flows for used cars. In the case of ICE vehicles, for example, some countries (e.g. Bolivia, Côte d'Ivoire, Peru) limit the maximum age of used car imports to prevent the dumping of highly polluting cars. Other countries \n(e.g. Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, India, South Africa) have banned used car imports entirely to protect their domestic manufacturing industries. \n\nJust as for ICE vehicles, policy measures can either help or hinder the import of used electric cars, such as by setting emission standards for imported used cars.\n\nImporting countries will also need to simultaneously support roll-out of charging infrastructure to avoid problems with access like those reported in Sri Lanka after an incentive scheme significantly increased imports of used EVs in 2018.

{"doc_id": 440, "text": "The median age of vehicle imports tends to increase as the GDP per capita of a country decreases. In some African countries, the median age of imports is over 15 years. Beyond this timeframe, electric cars may require specific servicing to extend their lifetime. To support the availability of second-hand markets for electric cars, it will be important to develop strategies, technical capacity, and business models to swap very old batteries from used vehicles. Today, many countries that import ICE vehicles, including EMDEs, already have servicing capacity in place to extend the lifetimes of used ICE vehicles, but not used EVs. On the other hand, there are typically fewer parts in electric powertrains than in ICE ones, and these parts can even be more durable. Battery recycling capacity will also be needed, given that the importing country is likely to be where the imported EV eventually reaches end-of-life. Including end-of-life considerations in policy-making today can help mitigate the risk of longer-term environmental harm that could result from the accumulation of obsolete EVs and associated waste in EMDEs. Policy choices in more mature markets also have an impact on possible trade flows. For example, the current policy framework in the European Union for the circularity of EV batteries may prevent EVs and EV batteries from leaving the European Union, which brings energy security advantages but might limit reuse. \n\nIn this regard, advanced economies and EMDEs should strengthen co-operation to facilitate second-hand trade while ensuring adequate end-of-life strategies. For example, there could be incentives or allowances associated with extended vehicle lifetimes via use in second-hand markets internationally before recycling, as long as recycling in the destination market is guaranteed, or the EV battery is returned at end of life.\n\nIndia, China and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries are the biggest two- and three-wheeler (2/3W)9 markets worldwide. In 2023, sales of 2/3Ws in these markets, including both electric and ICE powertrains, reached 19 million, 17 million and 14 million units, respectively. Indonesia, Viet Nam, the Philippines and Thailand are the biggest markets among ASEAN countries, with sales of 2/3Ws far outnumbering sales of LDVs, highlighting their importance in the region. Likewise, the number of 2/3Ws in India is 157 per 1 000 people, compared with only 35 passenger cars. \n\nDespite having smaller 2/3W markets overall, 2/3Ws also play a critical role in Latin America and Africa for daily passenger and commercial transportation. \n\nElectrifying 2/3Ws is therefore a promising lever for decarbonising mobility and improving urban air quality in these regions. \n\nIn 2023, the sales share of electric 2/3Ws was just 13% globally, while in terms of stock shares, 2/3Ws represent the most electrified road transport segment, with about 8% of 2/3Ws being electric. China sold the most electric 2/3Ws in 2023, with over 30% of the 2/3W sales being electric (decreasing from about 50% in 2022), \nfollowed by India (8%) and ASEAN countries (3%).\n\nThe global market for electric two-wheelers (2Ws) shrank 18% in 2023, continuing the downward trend of 2022, which was almost entirely due to supply chain challenges stemming from China's pandemic-related restrictions. The decline at the global level was largely driven by a 25% drop in China, which continues to command the vast majority of global electric 2W sales. The Chinese electric 2W market downturn could be explained by the continuing supply chain disruptions related to 2022 zero-Covid policies. \n\nThe fall in global electric 2W sales masks steady growth in the expanding Indian market and in some ASEAN countries. However, they are still dwarfed by China, which accounted for 78% of global sales, with nearly 6 million electric 2Ws sold in 2023, compared to 880 000 in India and 380 000 in ASEAN countries.

{"doc_id": 441, "text": "In India - the second-largest electric 2W market globally - 2023 sales grew by 40% compared to 2022. The Indian electric 2W market is dominated by the five largest domestic manufacturers (Ola Electric, TVS Motor, Ather, Bajaj and Ampere), which accounted for more than 75% of sales. The rapid growth seen in India is the result of strong policy support for EV deployment, such as the FAME \nII measure, which was first introduced in 2019 as a three-year purchase incentive policy. FAME II came to an end on 31 March 2024, and will initially be replaced by a new four-month subsidy extension scheme called the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS), announced in March 2024, which outlays over INR 4.9 billion\n(Indian rupees) (almost USD 60 million) to subsidise electric 2/3W purchases. The EMPS aims to support the roll-out of 372 000 additional electric 2/3Ws equipped with Li-ion batteries, bridging the gap between the FAME II scheme and potential future EV subsidies. Other policies such as the supply-side incentives under the PLI scheme, Goods and Service Tax (GST) and Regional Transport Office (RTO) tax rebates, along with India's Go Electric campaign, have all helped bolster electric 2W uptake. As an illustration of the effect of the latest subsidy schemes, in 2023, the salesweighted average price of an electric 2W - after subsidies and tax rebates - was over 15% lower than its ICE equivalent, despite the upfront purchase price remaining around 30% higher on average. The savings potential of an electric 2W proves even more compelling from a TCO perspective. An electric 2W purchased in 2024 (assuming sales-weighted average prices from 2023) after 5 years of ownership would be more than 40% cheaper than its ICE equivalent over the same period (see figure below), despite the EMPS scheme offering reduced subsidies compared to FAME II. Although sales decreased to 250 000 units in 2023, Viet Nam remains the most dynamic electric 2W market amongst ASEAN countries, with a 9% share of 2W \nsales. ASEAN countries have the specificity of having higher share of scooters relative to other types of 2W, along with a high share of models equipped with lead-acid batteries, which accounted for 68% of electric 2W sales in 2020. The Vietnamese electric 2W market is dominated by a handful of home-grown manufacturers (such as VinFast, Pega and Dibao), whose overall manufacturing production capacity exceeds the local domestic sales, thus giving them the capacity to export to other ASEAN country markets. Elsewhere, Indonesia is aiming to increase its domestic electric motorbike manufacturing, allocating USD 455 million in subsidies to reach 800 000 new electric motorcycle sales, along with the conversion of 200 000 conventional motorcycles. \n\nChina, India, and all ASEAN countries remain far ahead of all other regions in terms of electric 2/3W sales, where other regions combined account for less than 5% of global sales. Türkiye ranks as the first market outside of Asia, followed by France, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain.\n\nBreakdown of total cost of ownership of two- and three-wheelers in China **and India,** \n2023 IEA.

{"doc_id": 442, "text": "Globally, the three-wheeler (3W) market grew 13% in 2023, to reach 4.5 million sales, 21% of which were electric, compared to 18% in 2022. Almost 1 million electric 3Ws were sold in 2023, reflecting 30% growth compared to 2022. The market is highly concentrated, with China and India together accounting for more than 95% of all electric and 80% of conventional 3W sales. India overtook China in 2023 to become the biggest market for electric 3Ws, with over 580 000 sales. India saw its sales increase by 65% with respect to 2022, thanks to government financial incentives and resulting reductions in the cost of ownership of electric 3Ws. Sales in China declined 8% in 2023, to 320 000, making the country the second-largest electric 3W market. \n\nThe Chinese market continues to have a high share of lead-acid batteries in sales, despite government efforts to ban this technology in low-speed EVs and encourage a transition towards Li-ion technology, motivated by environmental concerns associated with the afterlife of lead-acid batteries when not recycled properly. Due to their low upfront purchase price, lead-acid battery powered electric 3Ws remain a widespread transport technology across India and rural China. In India, estimates of their market share range from 55% to 98%. However, Li-ion batteries are expected to continue gaining ground in the Indian 3W market following the introduction of the 2024 EMPS subsidy scheme, which specifically aims to reduce the purchase price of models equipped with advanced battery chemistries. \n\nIn 2023 in India, despite the upfront price being 55% higher than for its gasoline equivalent, the average electric 3W model (auto-rickshaw) is more than 50% \ncheaper to own after 8 years of service, and even without subsidies is over 40% \ncheaper (see figure above). Even when considering the most cost-effective ICE\n3W running on natural gas, the electric model achieves TCO parity as soon as 2 years after purchase, and works out about 40% cheaper over an 8-year lifetime. \n\nHowever, subsidies still play an important role, as without them, the TCO\nbreakeven point is only reached after 4 years. \n\nThe market for electric light commercial vehicles (LCVs) continued to increase in 2023. Global electric LCV sales grew by more than 50%, and the sales share grew to just under 5%. Two of the biggest electric LCV markets, China and Europe, saw a large increase in sales in 2023, as part of a broader trend of increasing LCV sales - both electric and ICE. In China, electric LCV sales exceeded 240 000, and in Europe, the electric LCV market leapt by 60% to reach almost 150 000. \n\nAs the electric LCV market matures, several OEMs have announced new electric models and new partnerships. Some of these new models are designed specifically for niche commercial activities, such as the B-ON Pelkan electric delivery van. In a partnership with Uber, Kia announced a modular van design with a body that can be swapped from shuttling to last-mile delivery depending on activity. \n\nThe average range of new LCVs increased by 55% between 2015 and 2023. For example, the two most popular electric LCV models in 2015 (Nissan e-NV200 and the Renault Kangoo BEV) had a range of around 170 km. This compares to a much longer range - between 210 and 260 km - demonstrated by two very popular models (Hyundai Porter and Ford E-Transit) in 2023. Despite this increase, companies expanding their electric fleets have called for improvements in the accuracy of range labelling. Korea is the only country in which the penetration of electric LCVs is moving faster than electric passenger cars. In Korea, the Hyundai Porter and the Kia Bongo are the only electric LCV models sold. Both are produced by local manufacturers, and seem particularly suited for the Korean light freight market, which is characterised by shorter distances. These models are also favourably priced compared to ICE \nequivalents: The Kia Bongo 3 EV, for example, sells for around USD 25 000, including a subsidy of USD 7 700. \n\nIEA.

{"doc_id": 443, "text": "Sales of electric buses, comprising all medium- and large-sized buses, are far ahead of those of other heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) segments (including mediumand heavy-duty trucks10). Several European countries (such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland) and China achieved sales shares above 50% in 2023, and more than one-fifth of bus sales were electric in Canada, Chile, Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Sweden. Globally, almost 50 000 electric buses were sold in 2023, equating to 3% of total bus sales and bringing the global stock to approximately 635 000 in total. This relatively low share is primarily due to the limited sales shares in most EMDEs, as well as the low market penetration of electric buses in some larger markets such as the United States and Korea. \n\nEarly policy support for electrifying public transport, and the availability of domestically produced electric buses, coupled with incentives, meant that China took an early and significant lead in electric bus sales. In 2020, China was responsible for about 90% of electric bus sales worldwide. In 2023, this fell to around 60%, largely due to a decrease in domestic demand for both electric and ICE buses and, to a lesser extent, increasing sales in other regions. The fall in Chinese demand could be a consequence of the early success seen for electric buses - around 65% of China's electric bus stock was deployed before 2019. It may also be linked to the ending of purchase subsidies for BEV and PHEV buses at the end of 2022. Despite China's lead in global sales having shrunk, Chinese manufacturers continue to export large volumes of electric buses, accounting for over 85% of electric city bus deployments in Latin America. They have also increased their market share in the European Union from 10% of bus sales in 2017 to 30% in 2023, driven by companies such as Yutong and BYD. \n\nCity buses, in particular, have strong potential for electrification thanks to their relatively fixed driving patterns and lower daily travel distances, and have spearheaded growth in electric bus sales. In the European Union, BEVs reached a 43% sales share among city buses in 2023, demonstrating clear progress towards the proposed target of 100% of city bus sales being zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2035. Over the same period, just 1% of European Union coach sales were battery electric, though uptake is increasing there and around the world. \n\nThere has also been encouraging progress in EMDEs, where a focus on the cobenefits of electric buses - such as reduced air pollution and greater access to public transport - has boosted take-up. This has been further supported by the wide availability of electric buses in already competitive markets. Cities across Latin America, such as Bogota and Santiago, have deployed nearly 6 500 electric buses to date. BasiGo, Africa's largest electric bus company, has an order book of 350 buses, which represents almost 2% of electric bus sales outside of China in 2023, and aims to sell a further 1 000 electric buses in Kenya and 200 in Rwanda in the coming years. \n\nAlong with high potential for electrification of city buses, infrastructure developments can also support the transition. The bus rapid transit (BRT) system, which is based on the use of dedicated bus lanes with priority access at intersections and off-board fare collection, can support the establishment of highcapacity, efficient services for cities. The new all-electric BRT system in Dakar - \nthe first on the African continent - is a strong example. This network, announced at the end of 2023, will serve 320 000 passengers per day. Elsewhere, the European bus rapid transit of 2030 (eBRT2030) scheme aims to improve the urban transport environment by developing innovative solutions for electric BRTs, with demonstrations in Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona and Prague, among other cities. \n\nSales of electric trucks increased 35% in 2023 compared to 2022, meaning that total sales of electric trucks surpassed electric buses for the first time, at around 54 000. China is the leading market for electric trucks, accounting for 70% of global sales in 2023, down from 85% in 2022. In Europe, electric truck sales increased almost threefold in 2023 to reach more than 10 000 (>1.5% sales share). The United States also saw a threefold increase, though electric truck sales reached just 1 200, less than 0.1% of total truck sales. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 444, "text": "We expect electric truck sales to continue to increase thanks to strong and ambitious policies, such as the European Union's CO2 standards for HDVs, which target a 90% CO2 emissions reduction by 2040. In the United States, the newly adopted heavy-duty emissions regulation is expected to result in ZEV sales shares of up to 60% by 2032 in different segments. \n\nAt the city level, zero emissions (or \"green\") zones for freight, are being implemented in 15 different cities as diverse as London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Quito, Shenzhen, Seoul and Taoyuan City. Together, these cities have a total population of over 52 million. In addition, initiatives such as EV100+, the Global Memorandum of Understanding on Zero-Emission Medium and Heavy Duty Vehicles co-led by Drive to Zero, the European Clean Trucking Alliance, the eTransport coalition, the First Movers Coalition–Trucking, and the Fleet Electrification Coalition have increased their membership. They continue to advocate for more ambitious policies, such as accelerated sales targets and zero emission government fleets. \n\nIn the United States, there have been efforts to use demonstration projects to identify truck segments ripe for electrification. In June 2023, the North American Council for Freight Efficiency, together with the Rocky Mountain Institute, launched Run on Less - Electric DEPOT. Through this initiative, depots deployed almost 300 electric trucks of various sizes to gather telemetry data with the aim of identifying use cases where electric trucks are already a viable solution, as well as where challenges remain. \n\nSimilarly, the UK Government is investing USD 250 million under the Zero Emission HGV and Infrastructure Programme to run real-world trials of zeroemission trucks. The programme will deploy 370 trucks and almost 60 refuelling and electric charging sites. \n\nElectric truck adoption is also gaining momentum in EMDEs outside of China. In India, NITI Aayog launched the Electric Freight Accelerator for Sustainable Transport, a platform to pioneer collaboration between the government and private sector partners for large-scale freight electrification. This initiative has spurred 16 major manufacturing and logistics companies to collectively signal demand for 7 750 electric freight vehicles by 2030. To meet this demand, focused efforts will be needed on policy regulation, establishing market certainty, scalable pilot support, infrastructure development, and creating blended financing platforms to attract private investments.\n\nSources: IEA analysis based on country submissions and data from EV Volumes, as well as China EV100, CADA, CCVDA\nand Interact Analysis for sales data for China . \nElectric truck sales **and sales share by region, 2015-2023**\n\nChinese OEMs currently produce by far the largest number of models of battery electric HDVs - 430 in total - with a particular focus on buses suitable for urban public transport, which make up almost 40% of all models. 11 In 2021 alone, Chinese OEMs released almost 150 bus models, providing more choice and covering more applications in what was already the world's largest electric bus market. Since 2021, the number of additional new models has continued to grow, but with a more even distribution across different segments - over 65 new models for buses, and around 40 each for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks - thereby enabling wider electrification. A significant number of models is now available in each segment in China. \n\nNorth American OEMs produce a far smaller number of battery electric models - \nover 170 - with a greater emphasis on the medium-duty truck market, which accounts for more than 60% of all models. New brands such as Rizon are targeting the electric medium-duty segment in North America, where despite their higher upfront costs, electric trucks are already competitive with diesel trucks in terms of total cost of ownership, especially when charged at depot as opposed to highercost public charging. Costs are even more competitive when factoring in incentives available in the United States and Canada. Though both the United States and Canada also have policy incentives specifically targeting buses, they have relatively small public transport markets and, as a consequence, buses suitable for urban public transport make up just over 10% of all models. Instead, OEMs have targeted the school bus niche, producing nine different models excluding minibuses. \n\nDespite producing a lower number of battery electric models overall, at around 120, European OEMs offer the most even distribution of models across segments.

This has allowed European OEMs, in particular the Volvo group (which includes the Mack, Renault, and Dongfeng (joint venture) truck brands), to gain a large share of not only the European, but also the North American heavy-duty electric truck market. European OEMs also produce a significant number of niche vehicles such as refuse trucks (around 10% of all models), which - like mediumduty trucks - are already cost-competitive with their ICE counterparts. \n\nOn average, individual Chinese OEMs produce more models across segments, which differentiates Chinese OEMs from those in other regions.

This figure is based on a continuously updated inventory but may not be fully comprehensive due to new model announcements and small manufacturers not yet captured in the database. Values for 2020 include models released between 2016 and 2020 inclusive. The database contains coaches, school buses, shuttle buses, and transit buses, categorised here as \"Bus\", which refers to those with more than 25 seats. \"MD truck\" includes medium-duty (MD) trucks, MD step vans, and cargo vans with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of greater than 3.5 t but less than 15 t. \"HD truck\" includes all freight trucks with a GVW of greater than 15 t. \"Specialised truck\" includes garbage/refuse trucks, concrete mixers, and other specialised mobile commercial trucks. Buses with 25 seats or fewer and light commercial vehicles, which have a GVW of less than 3.5 t, are excluded from this analysis. Vehicles of the same model that appear more than once in the database, but with small variations in specifications, such as battery capacity, payload or seating, are counted as one model. Sources: IEA analysis based on the Global Drive to Zero ZETI tool database.\n\nModel availability is a key indicator of the growing maturity of the battery electric HDV market, but the number of OEMs is also important for assessing competition and ability to meet future demand. The number of OEMs producing electric HDVs in China trebled between 2020 and 2023, from 12 to 36, in response to increasing sales of electric trucks domestically, as well as increasing electric bus sales abroad. In addition to growth in the number of Chinese OEMs, companies such as BYD, Skywell, Dongfeng and Foton have also expanded their offerings, with models in the bus, MD truck, and HD truck segments, offering potential advantages in terms of economies of scale and supply chains. The strength of the domestic market may also have allowed Chinese firms to build more robust supply chains. \n\nNorth America also experienced an almost threefold increase in the number of HDV OEMs between 2020 and 2023, from 16 to 45. Early support in states such as California and anticipation of national policies supported investment in HDV \nmanufacturing, which was later boosted by demand incentives and regulations. \n\nUnited States-based OEMs typically specialise in models for a smaller number of segments than Chinese OEMs. Only Lion offers vehicles in the bus, MD truck, and HD truck categories, along with Exro's recently acquired SEA Electric, which builds vehicles for different applications by adapting its powertrain to glider chassis platforms from other OEMs. Europe had the highest number of HDV OEMs in 2020, but still saw a 50% \nincrease between 2020 and 2023 to reach 36, the same number as China but less than the United States. Established OEMs such as Volvo Trucks, MAN, Mercedes, and Quantron offer vehicles in three or more segments. This wide range of offerings, coupled with an already strong position in the global market, and relatively low sales shares in Europe prior to 2023, meant there was less space for new entrants to compete. Manufacturers in the rest of the world have not responded to the electric HDV \nopportunity in the same way, mirroring the slower uptake of electric HDVs to date and fewer supportive policies than in leading electric HDV markets. Of the OEMs outside of China, North America and Europe, nine produce models in the bus segment alone, with India's Tata Motors producing both buses and MD trucks. Korean OEM Hyundai produces only FCEV HDVs, while only three Japanese OEMs feature in the database. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 446, "text": "There are almost ten times as many private chargers as public **ones, with most owners charging at home**\nHome charging is currently the most common means of charging electric cars. EV \nowners with access to a private parking space that can be equipped for charging can charge overnight, which is not only convenient but also typically takes advantage of lower electricity prices while demand is relatively low. \n\nThe availability of home charging varies substantially between regions and is linked to differences in urban, suburban and rural populations, as well as income bracket. In dense cities, where most people live in multi-unit dwellings, access to home charging is more limited and EV owners rely more heavily on public charging. This is most apparent in Korea, which is one of the world's most densely populated countries and has the highest ratio of public charging capacity to EVs. \n\nThough access to charging is different to actual use, it is a useful proxy for the levels of home charging among EV owners across countries. The share of EVs in new car sales is over 90% in Norway, whereas it stands at under 2% in Mexico, yet the shares of EV owners reportedly charging at home are similar, at 82% and 71%, respectively. The United Kingdom has one of the highest reported shares of access to home charging, at 93%, more than half of which are smart chargers.12 This is partly due to the United Kingdom being the first country to release smart charge point regulations, but, importantly, it could also be attributed to the high share of early EV adopters that also own a home in which a charger can be installed. In India, 55% of consumers state that they have access to home charging today. Changes to building regulations in order to mandate chargers, as have been proposed by the European Union, are an effective way of increasing access over time, especially for people who live in rented accommodation. In regions where the voltage of the power grid is 220V or above, EV owners can charge their vehicle from a regular domestic socket overnight. This is the most common case and holds true in Europe, Australia, large parts of Latin America, and most of Asia. In regions where the voltage is lower, typically 100-120V, \nrecharging speeds from regular domestic sockets are much slower,13 and can present a safety risk. As such, in countries with a 100-120V power grid, the ability to recharge in under ten hours requires installation of a dedicated charger.\n\nInstalled public and private light-duty vehicle charging points by power rating (public) \nand by type (private), 2015-2023\n\nNotes: \"Private - other\" refers to charging points that are neither publicly accessible nor charging points at private residences. \n\nHome charging stock is estimated based on electric light-duty vehicle stock and regional assumptions on electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE)/electric vehicle (EV) ratios.\n\nSources: IEA analysis based on country submissions. \n\nAlthough there are many more private chargers, public charging and the interoperability of its infrastructure is key to enabling more widespread adoption of and more equitable access to EVs. The public charging stock increased by more than 40% in 2023, and the growth of fast chargers - which reached 55% - \noutpaced that of slow chargers.\n\nOverall, China leads electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) deployment, with more than 85% of the world's fast chargers, and around 60% of slow chargers. \n\nHaving achieved an electric car sales share of over 35%, thus already surpassing their policy ambition for 2025, China is shifting focus to charging infrastructure development, targeting full coverage in cities and on highways by 2030, as well as expanded rural coverage. China has also begun to support more sustainable charging behaviour, with the aim that 60% of EV charging occurs off-peak by 2025, starting with five pilot cities. \n\nIn late 2023, the European Union agreed on the text of the alternative fuels infrastructure regulation (AFIR), which will require public fast chargers every 60 km along the European Union's main transport corridors (Trans-European Transport Network [TEN-T]). This will ensure that 1.3 kW of publicly accessible chargers are available for each registered BEV, and another 0.8 kW for each registered PHEV. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 447, "text": "Other developed markets are also expanding support for EVSE while reducing funding for vehicle incentives. The United Kingdom has ended subsidies for private cars, but maintained incentives for private and public charging installations, with more than 53 600 installed as of 2023, and 300 000 public chargers expected by 2030. New regulations relating to payments and reliability also aim to improve the customer experience. Elsewhere, Korea has reduced the value of its EV \nsubsidy while committing funding to EVSE. This has attracted additional private investment to the sector, and allowed for the installation of over 200 000 public chargers to date. \n\nIn other countries, EVSE targets are being adopted alongside vehicle targets.\n\nNew Zealand released its charging strategy in 2023, targeting one charging hub16 every 150-200 km on main highways, and at least 600 charging stations installed in rural areas by 2028. The United States announced funding for new EVSE\nprojects, and has already installed more than 180 000 public chargers towards the goal of 500 000 by 2030, as well as funding the repair or replacement of existing chargers. Canada is currently on track to meet its target of 33 500 charging ports by 2026. Developing markets are also increasingly recognising the importance of EVSE, such as India, which provided funding for over 7 000 fast chargers in 2023. As the number of public chargers grows, attention is also turning to the interoperability of charging infrastructure. In the United States, SAE International announced it would use Tesla's charging connector (J3400) as the standard across North America under the North American Charging Standard (NACS). The aim is to ensure that any supplier or manufacturer is able to use and deploy the connector, providing EV drivers with more options for reliable, convenient charging across North America. \n\nBoth the AFIR regulation in Europe, and the NACS in North America, are examples of legislation enacted to enhance interoperability of the charging infrastructure. Achieving greater interoperability across more regions will require enhanced collaboration amongst all stakeholders in order to agree common standards and protocols.\n\nDeployment of EV chargers should be co-ordinated with power grid developments to ensure that new connections are consistent with the wider grid-planning horizon. When not managed appropriately, charging can lead to a surge in peak demand, meaning that it is increasingly important to ensure that transmission and distribution grids are appropriately sized and equipped.17 Strategies to manage charging, such as through time-of-use tariffs and smart-charging, will become more necessary as EV deployment grows. \n\nHigh ratios of publicly available charging capacity to EVs in use are crucial in regions where home charging is less accessible, and can help improve the consumer experience more widely. Sufficient coverage reduces concerns about range, and can allow for vehicles with lower battery capacity, thereby reducing costs and critical material demand. Accurately planning for the most appropriate ratio can prove challenging due to the varying supply and demand dynamics within individual countries. Insufficient public charging infrastructure (high EV:EVSE \nratio) could lead to considerable customer inconvenience, while excessive infrastructure (low EV:EVSE ratio) may prove uneconomical. Finding an appropriate balance is important to ensuring optimal utilisation and satisfaction among EV users. \n\nIt may be more relevant to consider the total charging capacity per EV rather than EV:EVSE ratio, given that fast chargers can serve more EVs per day than slow chargers. In the initial phases of infrastructure development, the ratio of charging capacity to EV is generally high, given that charger usage will likely be low until the market matures. As the market matures and utilisation increases, the capacity per EV tends to decrease.\n\nConnecting cities through EVSE along motorways is a priority for a number of governments. In 2023, the Australian Government announced that it will provide AUD 39.3 million (Australian dollars) to the National Roads and Motorists' Association, through the Driving the Nation Fund, to build EV chargers along national highways. This proposal (like that of New Zealand) aims to install chargers every 150 km along eligible routes.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 448, "text": "Number of electric light-duty vehicles per public charging point and kilowatt per electric light-duty vehicle, 2023 Charging ratios also illustrate the differing priorities of governments with regards to slow versus fast charging. Although New Zealand has the most vehicles per charger, it is ahead of countries such as Australia and Thailand when considering charging capacity per EV. This can be attributed to New Zealand prioritising fast public chargers over slow, resulting in the highest proportion of fast chargers to slow chargers globally, standing at 75%. Similarly, the next highest proportions globally are observed in South Africa, China, and Norway, with 53%, 44% and 41%, respectively. At the other end of this spectrum lie countries such as Brazil, the Netherlands and Korea, which have installed more slow public chargers, with the share of fast public chargers representing 0.1%, 4% and 10%, respectively.\n\nElectric HDVs can generally use the same charging points as LDVs, but the larger size of both the vehicle and battery, and the resulting longer charging times required can disrupt normal operations, ultimately creating a need for dedicated equipment and facilities. HDV charging facilities of this kind are still in the early stages of large-scale development and deployment. \n\nProgress is being made globally on developing standards for megawatt-scale chargers, with the aim of achieving maximum interoperability for electric HDVs. \n\nThis will be essential to enable a fast roll-out of the charging technology, and mitigate any potential risks and challenges faced by vehicle manufacturers, importers, international operators and equipment providers. In 2023, the European Union and United States produced a set of recommendations for charging infrastructure, including the harmonisation of standards between the two regions. In essence, this provided recognition of the adoption of the megawatt charging system (MCS) - which allows charging capacity up to 3.75 MW - by international standardisation organisations such as SAE International and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Some companies such as Kempower, who mainly operate in Europe but are expanding globally, are expected to introduce chargers designed to operate at up to 1.2 MW in 2024, ahead of the formal standardisation of the MCS, though this is not expected to cause issues of divergence. In Asia, predominantly in China and Japan, the ChaoJi-2 began demonstration in late 2023. Although ChaoJi-2 has a lower power rating than the MCS (up to 1.2 MW), it allows for compatibility with existing standards in the region.\n\nAccording to data collected by the Atlas EV Hub, a further 210 charging points are already operating in the United States to serve electric trucks, and another 1 020 are planned, around 75% of which are due to be completed in 2024. The weighted average capacity of chargers whose power was included in the database is 180 kW, with almost 95% being direct current fast chargers.\n\nTo date, there are around 160 truck-specific charging points deployed in Europe. \n\nIn early 2023, Europe's first truck charging corridor was launched along a 600 km stretch of the Rhine-Alpine corridor, one of the busiest road freight routes in Europe. All 6 public charging locations are fitted with 300 kW charging points. The company behind the corridor, BP pulse, is also electrifying one of the largest truck stops in the United Kingdom. Looking forward, the EU AFIR details the progressive roll-out of minimum coverage and capacity for HDV charging stations, specifying that each station must include at least one charger of at least 350 kW power output by the end of 2025. Alongside national policies, AFIR has sparked the creation of several pilot programmes dedicated to charging HDVs using MCS charging, such as HoLa, ZEFES, HV-MELA-BAT, and a joint ABB and Scania project. In late 2023, Milence, an independent joint venture established by Traton, Volvo and Daimler, presented their HDV charger. In collaboration with Hitachi Energy, they plan to build 1 700 public charging points across Europe by 2027, based on the MCS. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 449, "text": "Although high-powered charging can enable the decarbonisation of freight, it may also present challenges for the electricity grid, like fluctuations in power quality or supply-demand imbalances. These imbalances can cause grid congestion at the local level, and could affect entire regions where there is a large electric HDV fleet. Some countries, such as the Netherlands, are already developing policies to anticipate these issues. One way to mitigate challenges and avoid peak demand is through stationary storage batteries that are co-located with high-powered chargers. This solution would require significant capital expenditure (CAPEX) for the installation of large, stationary batteries, but it could also offer new revenue streams to charging station owners, such as through electricity price arbitrage or grid services provision. Co-locating renewable sources close to charging hubs can also decrease the stress on the local power grid. The electricity grid is a key enabling technology for HDV electrification, and careful planning and investment will be required in order to accommodate new loads. For further analysis of the impacts of HDV charging on the electricity grid, see the Outlook for electric vehicle charging infrastructure later in this report, as well as the recently published Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions. \n\nAlternative solutions for HDV charging may reduce uncertainty about the systemlevel costs associated with high-powered charging, and can already compete favourably in terms of total capital and operating costs. Two such solutions are battery swapping and electric road systems, both of which can potentially offer significant advantages compared to high-powered charging. \n\nBattery swapping can be completed in as little as five minutes, can help to extend battery life through more controlled charging, and can spread power demand over a longer period, thus reducing pressure on the electricity grid. Battery swapping is currently most developed in China, where it has been encouraged by national and local governments since 2020. As many as half of electric heavy-duty trucks sold in 2023 were enabled with battery-swapping technology. In late 2022, SAIC \nlaunched a joint venture to set up around 40 battery swapping stations in cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen, with the aim of installing 3 000 stations by 2025. In 2023, CATL, the world's largest producer of EV \nbatteries, launched QIJI Energy, an all-in-one heavy-duty truck chassis batteryswapping solution, which aims to reduce costs by building upon existing battery technology. \n\nElectric road systems (ERS) allow vehicles to charge while they are driving, using one of three main technologies: induction between the vehicle and the road, conduction connections between the vehicle and road, or catenary lines.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 450, "text": "Demand for batteries and critical minerals continues to grow, led by electric car sales Increasing EV sales continue driving up global battery demand, with fastest growth in 2023 in the United States and Europe The growth in EV sales is pushing up demand for batteries, continuing the upward trend of recent years. Demand for EV batteries reached more than 750 GWh in 2023, up 40% relative to 2022, though the annual growth rate slowed slightly compared to in 2021-2022. Electric cars account for 95% of this growth. Globally, 95% of the growth in battery demand related to EVs was a result of higher EV \nsales, while about 5% came from larger average battery size due to the increasing share of SUVs within electric car sales. The United States and Europe experienced the fastest growth among major EV \nmarkets, reaching more than 40% year-on-year, closely followed by China at about 35%. Nevertheless, the United States remains the smallest market of the three, with around 100 GWh in 2023, compared to 185 GWh in Europe and 415 GWh in China. In the rest of the world, battery demand growth jumped to more than 70% in 2023 compared to 2022, as a result of increasing EV sales. In China, PHEVs accounted for about one-third of total electric car sales in 2023 and 18% of battery demand, up from one-quarter of total sales in 2022 and 17% \nof sales in 2021. PHEV batteries are smaller than those used in BEVs, thereby contributing less to increasing battery demand. In recent years, Chinese carmakers have also been marketing more extended-range EVs (EREVs), which use an electric motor as their unique powertrain but have a combustion engine that can be used to recharge the battery when needed. EREVs typically have a battery size about twice that of a PHEV, enabling a real-world electric range of around 150 km compared to 65 km for traditional PHEVs. With an ICE on board, EREVs can reach ranges of around 1 000 km when needed. In 2023, EREVs accounted for 25% of PHEV sales in China, up from about 15% in 2021-2022. \n\nNegligible EREV sales are recorded in other regions.\n\nElectric vehicle battery demand by mode and region, 2017-2023 More batteries means extracting and refining greater quantities of critical raw materials, particularly lithium, cobalt and nickel Rising EV battery demand is the greatest contributor to increasing demand for critical metals like lithium. Battery demand for lithium stood at around 140 kt in 2023, 85% of total lithium demand and up more than 30% compared to 2022; for cobalt, demand for batteries was up 15% at 150 kt, 70% of the total. To a lesser extent, battery demand growth contributes to increasing total demand for nickel, accounting for over 10% of total nickel demand. Battery demand for nickel stood at almost 370 kt in 2023, up nearly 30% compared to 2022. High levels of investment in mining and refining in the past 5 years have ensured that global supply can comfortably meet demand today, not only for EVs but also in historical markets including portable electronics, ceramics, metals and alloys. In 2023, the supply of cobalt and nickel exceeded demand by 6.5% and 8%, and supply of lithium by over 10%, thereby bringing down critical mineral prices and battery costs. While low critical mineral prices help bring battery costs down, they also imply lower cash flows and narrower margins for mining companies. \n\nCompared to just a few years earlier, overcapacity means that many companies are now struggling to stay afloat (see later section on trends in the EV industry). \n\nMining and refining will need to continue growing quickly to meet future demand, to avoid supply chain bottlenecks and make supply chains more resilient to potential disruptions. Doing so will also require striking a balance between remaining profitable while competing on prices. Innovative technologies such as sodium-ion batteries can potentially mitigate demand for critical minerals, together with the rise of mature battery chemistries requiring lower amounts of critical metals, such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP). \n\nSupply and demand of battery metals by sector, 2017-2023", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 451, "text": "The majority of battery demand for EVs today can be met with domestic or regional production in China, Europe and the United States. However, the share of imports remains relatively large in Europe and the United States, meeting more than 20% and more than 30% of EV battery demand, respectively. China is the world's largest EV battery exporter, with around 12% of its EV batteries being exported. Production in Europe and the United States reached 110 GWh and 70 GWh of EV \nbatteries in 2023, and 2.5 million and 1.2 million EVs, respectively. In Europe, the largest battery producers are Poland, which accounted for about 60% of all EV \nbatteries produced in the region in 2023, and Hungary (almost 30%). Germany leads the production of EVs in Europe and accounted for nearly 50% of European EV production in 2023, followed by France and Spain (with just under 10% each). Battery production in China is more integrated than in the United States or Europe, given China's leading role in upstream stages of the supply chain. China represents nearly 90% of global installed cathode active material manufacturing capacity and over 97% of anode active material manufacturing capacity today. \n\nThe only countries with significant shares of cathode active material manufacturing capacity outside of China today are Korea (9%) and Japan (3%).\n\nDifferent supply chains are, however, required for different chemistries. China is home to almost 100% of the LFP production capacity and more than threequarters of the installed lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) and other nickel-based chemistries production capacity, compared to 20% in Korea. LFP is the most prevalent chemistry in the Chinese electric car market, while NMC \nbatteries are more common in the European and American electric car markets.\n\nChina's current leading role in battery production, however, comes at the cost of high levels of overcapacity. In 2023, excluding portable electronics, China used less than 40% of its maximum cell output, 20 and cathode and anode active material installed manufacturing capacity was almost 4 and 9 times greater than global EV cell demand in 2023. To take advantage of some of this excess capacity, China is the biggest exporter of EV cells, cathodes and anodes globally. However, this has significantly decreased producers' margins, which may put some at risk if they do not find enough customers outside of China. \n\nNotes: EV = electric vehicle; RoW = Rest of the world. The unit is GWh. Flows represent battery packs produced and sold as EVs. Battery net trade is simulated accounting for the battery needs of each region for each battery manufacturer, and assuming that domestic production is prioritised over imports. The eventual gap between domestic production and battery needs is filled through imports, which is assigned as a function of the unused manufacturing capacity of the other regions after satisfying their internal demand. This analysis does not consider battery production for stationary or portable electronics applications or stockpiling. \n\nSources: IEA analysis based on data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence and EV Volumes. \n\nIn 2023, the installed battery cell manufacturing capacity was up by more than 45% in both China and the United States relative to 2022, and by nearly 25% in Europe. If current trends continue, backed by policies like the US IRA, by the end of 2024, capacity in the United States will be greater than in Europe. As manufacturing capacity expands in the major electric car markets, we expect battery production to remain close to EV demand centres through to 2030, based on the announced pipeline of battery manufacturing capacity expansion as of early 2024. At the same time, international co-operation and trade in battery technologies will continue to underpin EV market expansion. Just as for current capacity, announcements for additional EV battery manufacturing capacity in Europe and the United States are primarily made by foreign companies headquartered in Asia. \n\nKorean companies, for example, account for over 350 GWh in manufacturing capacity outside Korea, Japanese companies for 57 GWh outside Japan, and Chinese companies for just under 30 GWh outside China. About 75% of existing European manufacturing capacity is owned by Korean companies, with LG's plant in Poland accounting for 50% alone. Capacity in the United States is currently led by four companies: Tesla, Panasonic, SKI and LG. China's capacity is slightly more fragmented across different manufacturers, but the three largest producers - CATL, BYD and Gotion - account for nearly 50% of domestic capacity.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 452, "text": "Stabilising critical mineral prices led battery pack prices to fall in 2023 Turmoil in battery metal markets led the cost of Li-ion battery packs to increase for the first time in 2022, with prices rising to 7% higher than in 2021. However, the price of all key battery metals dropped during 2023, with cobalt, graphite and manganese prices falling to lower than their 2015-2020 average by the end of 2023. This led to an almost 14% fall in battery pack price between 2023 and 2022, despite lithium carbonate prices at the end of 2023 still being about 50% higher than their 2015-2020 average. The last year in which battery price experienced a similar price drop was 2020. \n\nIn relative terms, the LFP chemistry was most affected by the surge in battery mineral prices in the last two years. Lithium is the only critical mineral in LFP, and its price grew more than that of other minerals, and remained above historical averages for longer. In comparison, NMC batteries were less than 25% more expensive than their LFP equivalents in 2023, down from a premium of 50% in 2021. LFP batteries remain significantly cheaper than NMC, and their price has recently decreased rapidly. \n\nFurther innovation-driven improvements are foreseen for both chemistries through recent battery pack configurations, such as cell-to-pack21 (already being adopted for LFP) and cell-to-chassis. In addition, continued innovation in manufacturing is helping to achieve improved battery performance, for example through multi-layer electrodes enabling ultra-fast charging. Efforts to increase the manganese content of both NMC and LFP are also underway, with the aim of either increasing energy density while keeping costs low (LFP) or reducing cost while maintaining high energy density (NMC).\n\nIn terms of regional competitiveness, batteries are cheapest in China, followed by North America, Europe and other Asia Pacific countries. However, battery prices across regions, including both batteries produced locally and imports, have been converging in the past few years, indicating that EV batteries are moving towards becoming a truly globalised product. Nonetheless, battery manufacturing in Europe and the United States remains more expensive than in China. For example, producing a battery cell in the United States is nearly 20%22 more expensive than in China, even when assuming that material costs do not vary regionally. In reality, Chinese manufacturers are likely to benefit from preferential prices from local material producers and a more integrated supply chain within China, which could mean the manufacturing cost gap is even larger. Moreover, contrary to the United States and Europe, most Chinese batteries are LFP, which is more than 20% cheaper to produce than NMC. \n\nAverage battery price index by selected battery chemistry and region, 2020-2023 \n\nOver the last five years, LFP has moved from a minor share to the rising star of the battery industry, supplying more than 40% of EV demand globally by capacity in 2023, more than double the share recorded in 2020. LFP production and adoption is primarily located in China, where two-thirds of EV sales used this chemistry in 2023. The share of LFP batteries in EV sales in Europe and the United States remains below 10%, with high-nickel chemistries still most common in these markets. LFP was first invented in the United States in 1997, and further developed in Canada through the early 2000s, but thanks to a favourable intellectual property agreement, China has been the only country mass-producing LFP batteries since the 2010s. In 2022, the core LFP patents expired, sparking interest in production outside of China. The recent surge in interest in LFP chemistries has led to major investments in Morocco, which is home to the world's largest phosphate reserves and, importantly, holds free-trade agreements with the United States and Europe. \n\nIn 2022, Morocco saw almost as many announced investments to as in the five previous years combined, reaching USD 15.3 billion.

CC BY 4.0.\nShare of battery capacity of electric vehicle sales by chemistry **and region, 2021-2023**\nFurther declines in battery cost and critical mineral reliance might come from sodium-ion batteries, which can be produced using similar production lines to those used for lithium-ion batteries. The need for critical minerals like nickel and manganese for sodium-ion batteries depends on the cathode chemistry used, but no sodium-ion chemistries require lithium. Similarly to LFP, sodium-ion batteries were initially developed in the United States and Europe, but today the announced sodium-ion manufacturing capacity in China is estimated to be about ten times higher than in the rest of the world combined. Manufacturing capacity outside China is still at the laboratory or pilot scale. \n\nIn 2023, leading battery manufacturers announced expansion plans for sodiumion batteries, such as BYD, Northvolt and CATL, which initially sought to reach mass production by the end of the same year. If brought to scale, sodium-ion batteries could cost up to 20% less than incumbent technologies and be suitable for applications such as compact urban EVs and power stationary storage, while enhancing energy security. The development and cost advantages of sodium-ion batteries are, however, strongly dependent on lithium prices, with current low prices discouraging investments in sodium-ion and delaying expansion plans. Supply chain bottlenecks, such as for high-quality cathode and anode materials specific to sodium-ion batteries, could also hinder near-term expansion. \n\nMaterial content in anodes and cathodes, by chemistry, 2023 Notes: EV = Electric vehicle ; Li metal = lithium metal anode; Si-Gr = silicon-graphite anode; Graphite = pure graphite anode; Na-ion = sodium-ion; LFP = lithium iron phosphate; NMC = lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide; NCA = lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide; PW = Prussian white; Oxide (Na-ion) = Na0.83Ni0.32Mn0.47Mg0.1Ti0.12O2, for which magnesium (Mg) \n(0.06 kg/kWh) and titanium (Ti) (0.14 kg/kWh) are not displayed for simplicity.

Return on investment has increased more over the 2019-2023 period for these companies than it has for others, in relative terms. The combined market capitalisation of pure play EV \nmakers boomed from USD 100 billion in 2020 to USD 1 trillion at the end of 2023, with a peak over USD 1.6 trillion at the end of 2021, though this trend was primarily driven by Tesla. The market capitalisation of battery makers and battery metal companies also increased significantly over the same period.\n\nBehind this overall upward trend, however, there has been significant volatility. \n\nSupply chain disruptions and battery metal price fluctuations - notably in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine - as well as increasing competition, price wars among OEMs and expectations of slower relative annual growth as major EV \nmarkets mature, and of possible consolidation, are having an important downward impact on investor confidence and EV stocks.

Many emerging EV players - such as VinFast from Viet Nam, Polestar from Europe, and Canoo, Fisker, Lucid and Nikola from the United States - are missing sales targets and trading low. Fiercer competition and shrinking profits also have an impact upstream, among EV battery makers: in the first weeks of 2024, CATL \nwas trading near a three-year low, with a market capitalisation at its lowest point since the end of 2020. In the first quarter of 2024, the combined market capitalisation of pure play EV players fell below that of major incumbents, even if their financial stock performance remained robust.\n\nKey financial indicators for major car, battery, mining and cleantech companies As we reported last year in GEVO-2023, companies and investors are exploring new opportunities upstream in EV supply chains, especially as competition intensifies. Carmakers are seeking to secure direct deals with battery makers and companies involved in the mining and processing of critical minerals. Investors including large banks and funds are pouring capital into the metal industry. In 2023, Stellantis announced a partnership in Argentina to secure projected copper demand, investing USD 155 million. Volkswagen, Glencore and Chrysler each invested USD 100 million in a Special Purpose Acquisition Company operating nickel and copper assets, supported by several global investment banks for an overall USD 1 billion deal. In 2024, Tesla and several Korean battery makers, including LG and SK, met with Chilean government agencies regarding lithium supply, primarily with the aim of supplying the US market with the support of IRA tax credits. AustralianSuper, Australia's largest pension fund, announced plans to double its exposure to lithium stocks over the next five years, with investments in 2023, such as in Pilbara Minerals, worth AUD 560 million (USD 370 million). \n\nAs a result of increasing investor appetite and growing EV markets, the valuation of critical mineral companies has increased significantly in the last few years. Over the 2015-2022 period, the market capitalisation of companies involved in the extraction and processing of lithium increased sixfold. The margins for lithium, nickel and copper companies typically outperformed those of the top 100 mining companies over the same period, including relative to gold or iron ore.\n\nHowever, the picture in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 is changing. The volatile metal prices seen in the past few years, the increasing competition and pressure to drive down EV and battery prices, and the current overcapacity for several critical minerals (see earlier section on batteries), mean that major mining companies are revisiting growth and performance forecasts. After several years of important cash flows as a result of high prices and increasing volumes, many companies are now starting to struggle to finance both existing and new projects with their own revenues, suggesting external sources will be needed for largescale capital expenditure. \n\nIn Australia, for example, Albemarle, Core Lithium, Liontown Resources and Pilbara Minerals announced project spending reductions, lower dividends, and job cuts in 2024. Albermarle expects capital expenditures to drop by around USD 500 million from USD 2.1 billion in 2023 to USD 1.6-1.8 billion in 2024, and plans to reduce annual costs by nearly USD 100 million. Pilbara Minerals expects annual exploration spending to be cut by up to AUD 100 million (USD 66 million). Nickel and cobalt projects in Australia have also been delayed or halted, involving companies like BHP, First Quantum Minerals and Wyloo Metals. First Quantum Minerals expects a 30% staff cut as a result of reduced operations. In the United States, Piedmont Lithium Inc. is letting go of 25% of staff. Over the 2024-2026 period, we could see progressive consolidation of critical mineral extraction and refining projects and businesses around lowest-cost producers.

BYD and Tesla's rise as global front-runners has primarily dented the market share of major incumbents, which accounted for 55% of global electric car sales in 2015 but have been falling behind ever since. In 2022, BYD had already overtaken Tesla as the world's best-selling EV company when accounting for plug-in hybrid cars. In the second half of 2023, BYD also became the world's best-selling battery electric car company. Counting both BEV \nand PHEV models, BYD's share of global electric car markets was just over 20%. \n\nIn China, BYD also became the top-selling car company with over 2.4 million new registrations or 11% of the domestic market, ahead of Volkswagen, which had been China's best-selling brand for over 15 years. BYD's worldwide sales exceeded 3 million, making it one of the world's top 10 car sellers. \n\nShare of global electric car markets by selected carmakers (left) and gross margin of selected companies (right), 2015-2023\n\nIn China, since the end of 2022, greater competition among front-runners has led electric car prices to fall quickly. The price of compact electric cars and SUVs dropped by up to 10% in 2023 relative to 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla once again slashed prices, by up to 6% or CNY 15 000 for its Models 3 and Y, \nforcing competitors to follow by squeezing margins. BYD proceeded with a 1020% cut on model prices, such as a CNY 10 000 reduction on its flagship Qin Plus; XPeng with a CNY 20 000 cut on its G6 series; and the GM-SAIC-Wuling joint venture with a CNY 6 000 cut on its Xingguang sedan. \n\nTesla has been able to afford such a strategy thus far thanks to a focus on highend models and greater profits per car sold, around USD 10 000 to USD 15 000 per electric car sold in 2022-2023 against around USD 6 000 for BYD, which also explains why Tesla's market value in 2023 remained 7 times higher than that of BYD. BYD's preferred strategy has been to sell cheaper models and protect margins by developing in-house battery supply chains. Other Chinese makers are now actively seeking to catch up by announcing new models. For example, XPeng announced new models for 2024 priced at around CNY 100 000-150 000, far more affordable than the premium models typically priced in the range of CNY 300 000.

In the United States, Tesla accounted for over 45% of all the battery electric cars ever sold as of 2023. However, Tesla's share in new US electric car sales has been shrinking, from over 60% in 2020 to 45% in 2023. Hyundai-Kia overtook GM and Ford in 2023, and now accounts for 8% of US electric car sales, second only to Tesla. Hyundai-Kia plans to start manufacturing operations at a Georgia-based factory in 2024, qualifying for IRA benefits. European carmakers accounted for 25% of US electric car sales, their highest share since 2017, led by Stellantis. About 15% of BMW's sales were electric, meeting its 2023 sales target, and in the same year the company went on record as saying that a tipping point for ICE cars had been reached, and that EVs would lead future growth. Meanwhile, other US carmakers accounted for 15% of electric car sales, half their share back in the 2015-2017 period, and GM and Ford announced a step back from their earlier sales objectives (see later section on Industry Outlook). In Europe, the share of electric car sales by local carmakers has been falling since 2015. In 2023, European carmakers accounted for 60% of electric car sales in the region, compared to over 80% in 2015. Volkswagen, Stellantis and BMW aggregated to 45% of European electric car sales in 2023, but competition is getting tougher among front-runners. The share of Stellantis jumped from under 2% in 2015 to nearly 15% in 2023, while Volkswagen's fell from 27% to 20%. Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance accounted for nearly 40% of European electric car sales in 2015, but just 7% in 2023. Tesla's share has stagnated around 10% \nbetween 2015 and 2023, while Chinese carmakers have seen important growth, from 5% in 2015 to just under 15% in 2023. \n\nGlobal competition is expected to further intensify in the coming years, especially as Chinese carmakers look to export in the context of battery and EV oversupply. \n\nJust as for steel and solar PV, China's subsidised industrial strategy for EVs, which was initiated 15 years ago, has led to significant excess capacity. Capacity utilisation stood below 70% among the top 10 sellers in the first months of 2023. There are also far more EV companies in China than can possibly survive in a competitive market. In 2014 alone, ten years ago, over 80 000 companies registered in China entered the electromobility sector. In 2023, over 80% of electric car sales in China were concentrated in just over 30 companies. In 2024, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology noted its concern that too many carmakers remain unprofitable. Nio, for example, recorded net losses of USD 3 billion in 2023. \n\nAs shrinking margins push the least profitable out of the race, China's EV industry is consolidating around a smaller number of robust champions - and they are looking abroad for expansion. Chinese auto exports grew steeply in 2023, up 60% relative to 2022, making China the world's largest car exporter, ahead of Japan and Germany. Despite high import taxes (e.g. 27% in the United States and 10%\nin the European Union) and tight regulatory scrutiny (e.g. the anti-subsidy EU \ninvestigation on EV imports since October 2023 and possible introduction of new tariffs from July 2024), Chinese OEMs often remain more competitive than incumbents. They could be well-placed to capture market share in the near term, especially in the small car segment. In early 2024, for example, BYD chartered its first cargo ship, with a capacity of 7 000 cars sailing to Europe. \n\nEuropean and US carmakers are under growing pressure as Chinese carmakers start to export at scale, and are adjusting corporate strategy accordingly. In February 2024, for example, Ford and GM expressed that they could even be open to partnering to compete against Chinese carmakers, and BYD in particular. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 457, "text": "Ford estimates losses on EV investments of up to USD 5.5 billion in 2023, and expects even tougher future competition from more affordable Tesla models and Chinese carmakers. Another example comes from Stellantis, which - considering the growing importance of Chinese pure play EV manufacturers on the global market - recently became an important shareholder of China's Leapmotor brand. \n\nVenture capital (VC) funding to EV start-ups has boomed in the past decade. \n\nFinancial investors such as banks and VC or private equity funds see in EV startups a potential for significant future returns. Many companies - including major incumbent carmakers - also use corporate VC to fund start-ups to develop new technology, or to acquire concepts developed by new entrants. Whereas in the past century, most carmakers typically developed ICE technology and manufacturing through in-house R&D, investing in start-ups has now become a notable trend. This allows incumbents to bolster their own position and maintain a competitive edge in quickly evolving markets and regulatory environments.\n\nIn 2023, however, global VC investments in clean energy start-ups fell considerably relative to 2022, and EVs and batteries were no exception. Earlystage investments (i.e. seed and series A, referring to the first rounds of financing and the earlier stages of development) in start-ups developing EV and battery technologies dropped 20% to USD 1.4 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, growth-stage investments (i.e. series B and growth equity, which refer to the later rounds of financing as start-ups increase activity) dropped 35% to USD 10.1 billion. Several important factors are contributing to this downward trend. As competition intensifies in EV and battery markets, and as incumbents ramp up their own investments and manufacturing plans, barriers to entry for new actors get higher, and so do investor perceptions of risk. The front-running start-ups that raised funds over the 2015-2020 period are now maturing and transitioning to other sources of capital, leaving fewer alternatives for newcomers - early-stage VC for electric carmakers dropped radically in 2023. Geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, high energy prices, and rising inflation and interest rates limit the availability of higher-risk capital. We also observe a cooldown following the postCovid-19 boom of 2021-2022, which was fuelled by investment restraint during the pandemic and the expectation of significant economic recovery packages afterwards.\n\nDespite the drop, investments remain far greater than in 2019, prior to the Covid19 pandemic. Start-ups developing EV charging technology attracted over USD 400 million in early-stage VC, and battery and battery component makers USD 260 million, together accounting for half of early-stage VC. There was also a surge for two- and three-wheeler start-ups, which raised USD 200 million in earlystage VC in 2023, up from below USD 100 million in previous years. While earlystage funding for electric carmakers has dried up, and in 2023 fell far short of the 2018-2022 rounds, investors continue to show interest in upstream and downstream segments of EV supply chains, as well as other EV types, especially if these can scale quickly. \n\nNotable deals in 2023 included Germany-based Jolt Energy's first round of VC \nfunding, which raised USD 160 million. The company seeks to bring its fastcharging technology to urban areas of Europe and the United States, and claims to provide 100 km of driving range in just 5 minutes. Similarly, German EV charging start-up Numbat raised USD 75 million in series A funding through the European Infrastructure Fund, as well as another USD 75 million in loans. Indian start-up Charge Zone also raised nearly USD 55 million to develop nearly 300 charging stations. \n\nChinese electric truck maker DeepWay raised USD 110 million in series A funding to start mass production, after having raised USD 70 million in 2022 to fund R&D \nand early-stage manufacturing. In the 2/3W space, Benin-based start-up Spiro raised USD 60 million, Indonesian Maka Motors raised over USD 37 million and Volta Indonesia USD 35 million, Brazilian Vammo raised USD 30 million, and Indian Simple Energy India raised USD 20 million, illustrating the importance of this segment in EMDEs. In India, Evera, a provider of all-electric cab services and management, raised USD 7 million to expand operations in Delhi, and Zyngo, an operator of electric last-mile delivery fleets, raised USD 5 million.

{"doc_id": 458, "text": "At the growth stage, battery technology developers attracted USD 5 billion, and electric carmakers USD 2.5 billion, with significant support from public investors, indicating interest from governments to help new entrants ramp up manufacturing capacity or accelerate expansion and deployment. However, growth-stage investor appetite for electric trucks and EV charging dried up relative to previous years. \n\nNotable deals include French battery maker Verkor, which raised USD 900 million in growth equity from investors including public-private EIT InnoEnergy and BPI France, and major incumbent carmaker Renault. The company also received a nearly USD 700 million grant from the French Government and another USD 650 million in debt from the European Investment Bank to develop a 16 GWh gigafactory project in Dunkirk. To support its global expansion, Swedish battery maker Northvolt raised USD 400 million from Ontario's asset manager, USD 1.2 billion and then another USD 150 million in debt from public Canadian investors and private banks, a USD 740 million grant from the German Government, and a USD 5 billion loan from the European Investment Bank and Nordic Investment Bank. Chinese lithium-ion battery maker Hithium also raised over USD 600 million. \n\nEarly-stage (left) and growth-stage (right) venture capital investments in start-ups \n\nChinese electric carmakers continued raising money in 2023, such as Hozon and Rox Motor, which each raised around USD 1 billion. Like other Chinese new entrants, Hozon Automobile is looking to expand in overseas markets as well as domestically, and could go public in Hong Kong. Rox Motor launched its first model in 2023, an electric SUV priced under USD 50 000. Premium electric carmaker Avatr raised USD 400 million, after having raised a similar amount in series A funding in 2022. \n\nIn the electric taxi fleet space, India-based BluSmart, a start-up providing ridehailing services, raised two rounds of USD 42 million and USD 24 million in growth equity in 2023, and another USD 25 million in 2024. However, there has been fierce competition with larger taxi fleet apps and operators in the past few years in EMDEs. In 2023, for example, electric ride-sharing app Beat, owned by Free Now, withdrew from Latin America.\n\nSimilarly to for other clean energy technologies, start-ups for EVs are predominantly headquartered in the United States, Europe or China. There is, however, significant variability across different EV technology areas. Over the 2018-2023 period, in cumulative terms, about 70% of the VC investments in startups developing electric cars were made in China, 20% in the United States and 10% in Europe. Meanwhile, about 95% of the VC investments in electric trucks, buses, and commercial vehicles were made in the United States. India, the only EMDE other than China that has a significant share in global VC \nmarkets, accounted for 70% of the investments in start-ups developing electric 2/3Ws. Over the 2018-2023 period, Indian EV start-ups raised USD 2.7 billion, of which over 70% was for electric 2/3Ws. Policy support has contributed to building investor appetite for the EV sector, and the high investment levels seen in 2022 and 2023 will warrant further examination in 2024 and beyond if the FAME subsidies are reduced or phased out. The investment potential in India's EV sector is estimated at around USD 200 billion, suggesting there are still considerable opportunities ahead for Indian entrepreneurs and start-ups.\n\nWith regards to batteries, start-ups based in the United States attracted most VC investments - from 30% to over 80% of global investments over the 2018-2023 period. Investments in battery makers, however, were split evenly among major VC markets, with 30% each for China, Europe and the United States. It is noticeable that battery VC remains extremely limited in historic battery-producing countries such as Japan and Korea, where technology innovation through startups is generally less common. \n\nCumulative **venture capital investment, by technology, country or region, 2018-2023**\nNotes: Includes both early- and growth-stage deals.

{"doc_id": 459, "text": "As VC investors look for new opportunities across EV supply chains, novel battery concepts and critical mineral extraction and refining are gaining momentum. Over the 2018-2020 period, cumulative early-stage VC flowing to battery and component makers stood around USD 430 million, nearly 75% of which was for lithium-based battery chemistries. Over the 2021-2023 period, cumulative investments for batteries not only more than tripled, to nearly USD 1.4 billion, they also diversified. Lithium chemistries accounted for just 60% of the total, while the share of emerging concepts such as metal-hydrogen, redox-flow, solid state and sodium-ion batteries rose, growing from less than 15% to more than 25%. \n\nNot all the start-ups active in the battery space today will eventually serve EV supply chains. In fact, many companies in our sample have so far announced that long-duration power storage is their primary target market. However, there are important spillover opportunities between those two closely related technology fields. For example, sodium-ion batteries can be used for both grid-level storage and EVs, and learnings in one sector can inform technology development in the other. \n\nNotable early-stage VC deals in novel battery chemistries in 2023 included rounds by Chinese WeView (USD 90 million), United States-based Noon Energy \n(USD 30 million) and XL Batteries (USD 10 million), and Singapore's VFlow Tech \n(USD 10 million), all of which are developing redox-flow batteries. Peak Energy, based in Colorado, was established in 2023 and raised USD 10 million in seed money to develop sodium-ion batteries. Similarly, Inlyte Energy raised USD 8 million in seed funding, after having received at least USD 250 000 in grants from the US Department of Energy (DoE) Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E) in 2022. In the battery recycling space, notable deals in 2023 included a USD 540 million round of growth equity funding to US-based Ascend Elements, a start-up that also received two grants from the DoE totalling USD 480 million in 2022. The company, which raised another USD 160 million in 2024, aims to build North America's first cathode precursor manufacturing facility using black mass, the typical output of lithium-ion battery recycling. Chinese Tianneng New Materials raised a series A of USD 140 million, and French MECAWARE USD 40 million. \n\nAs reported last year, critical minerals VC is also expanding, standing just under USD 400 million in 2023, or nearly twice as much as in 2021 or 2022. This technology field attracted under USD 75 million in cumulative VC over the 2018-2020 period. Cobalt extraction attracted nearly USD 200 million in 2023, just like in 2022. Lithium extraction and refining attracted USD 135 million, much higher than the dip of 2022 but still below the record year of 2021. We now observe deals for nickel extraction, suggesting investors are also looking for opportunities beyond cobalt and lithium.\n\nIn 2023, several governments have also launched critical raw material funds. For example, France committed EUR 500 million to the EUR 2 billion private equity Critical Metals Fund managed by InfraVia, as part of France 2030. Similarly, EIT \nInnoEnergy launched the European Battery Alliance's Strategic Battery Raw Material Fund, targeting investments of EUR 500 million. Other announcements and projects are mentioned in the later section on Industry Outlook in this report.\n\nNotable critical mineral deals in 2023 included a series A of USD 50 million by Canada-based Summit Nanotech to scale its more sustainable lithium extraction technology, after it received grants from public investors such as Sustainable Development Technology Canada and Natural Resources Canada. In the United States, Kobold Metals raised USD 195 million in growth equity to expand cobalt extraction, Energy Exploration Technologies raised USD 50 million for direct lithium extraction from GM Ventures, and Atlas Materials raised USD 27 million in seed money to develop nickel extraction technologies.\n\nVenture Capital investments in start-ups developing battery technologies by chemistry\n\nNotes: \"Other lithium\" includes lithium metal-based and lithium-sulphur batteries. \"Flow\" includes redox flow (including vanadium-based) as well as other flow batteries (e.g. iron-based, hydrogen-bromine). \"Other\" includes lead acid, metal-air, organic materials, and polymer batteries.

{"doc_id": 460, "text": "In this part of the report, we focus on pathways to electrify road transport over the period to 2035, expanding the time horizon by five years compared with previous editions of the Global EV Outlook. A scenario-based approach is used to explore the outlook for electric mobility, based on recent market trends, policy drivers and technology developments. \n\nThe purpose of the scenarios is to assess plausible futures for global electric vehicle (EV) markets and their potential implications. The scenarios do not make predictions about the future. Rather, they aim to provide insights to inform decision-making by governments, companies and other stakeholders about the future of EVs. \n\nThe projections in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) consider historical data through the end of 2023, as well as stated policies and ambitions as of the end of March 2024. The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) is consistent with the 2023 update to the IEA Net Zero Roadmap and the World Energy Outlook 2023. \n\nDeployment of electric vehicles is projected by road transport mode and by region. \n\nRegional results are presented for the STEPS and APS, while the discussion of the projections in the NZE Scenario focuses on global results. These projections are then compared to announcements by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and battery manufacturing capacity expansion announcements. These scenario projections incorporate GDP assumptions from the International Monetary Fund and population assumptions from the United Nations.\n\nThe Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) reflects existing policies and measures, as well as firm policy ambitions and objectives that have been legislated by governments around the world. It includes current EV-related policies, regulations and investments, as well as market trends based on the expected impacts of technology developments, announced deployments and plans from industry stakeholders. The STEPS aims to hold up a mirror to the plans of policy makers and illustrate their consequences. \n\nThe Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) assumes that all announced ambitions and targets made by governments around the world are met in full and on time. \n\nWith regards to electromobility, it includes all recent major announcements of electrification targets and longer-term net zero emissions and other pledges, regardless of whether these have been anchored in legislation or in updated Nationally Determined Contributions. For example, the APS assumes that countries that have signed on to the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) \ndeclaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emissions cars and vans will achieve this goal, even if there are not yet policies or regulations in place to support it. In countries that have not yet made a net zero emissions pledge or set electrification targets, the APS considers the same policy framework as the STEPS. Non-policy assumptions for the APS, including population and economic growth, are the same as in the STEPS. The difference between the APS and the STEPS represents the \"implementation gap\" that exists between the policy frameworks and measures required to achieve country ambitions and targets, and the policies and measures that have been legislated. \n\nThe Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario) is a normative scenario that sets out a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The scenario is compatible with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C with no or limited temperature overshoot, in line with reductions assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C. There are many possible paths to achieve net zero CO2 emissions globally by 2050 and many uncertainties that could affect them. The NZE Scenario is therefore a path and not the path to net zero emissions. The difference between the NZE Scenario and the APS highlights the \"ambition gap\" that needs to be closed to achieve the goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nIn the STEPS, the stock of EVs across all modes except for two/three-wheelers \n(2/3Ws),23 grows from less than 45 million in 2023 to 250 million in 2030 and reaches 525 million in 2035. As a result, in 2035, more than one in four vehicles on the road is electric. On average, the EV stock grows by 23% annually from 2023 to 2035.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 461, "text": "In the APS, the stock of EVs (excluding 2/3Ws) reaches 585 million in 2035, over 10% higher than in the STEPS, and 30% of the vehicle fleet (excluding 2/3Ws) is electric. Compared to the STEPS, the average annual growth in the EV fleet is only slightly higher, with an average 24% growth between 2023 and 2035. In the NZE Scenario, the fleet of EVs grows even more quickly, at an average annual rate of 27% to 2035, reaching 790 million (excluding 2/3Ws).\n\nNotes: STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; APS = Announced Pledges Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario; BEV = battery electric vehicle; PHEV = plug-in hybrid electric vehicle; PLDV = passenger light-duty vehicle; LCV = light commercial vehicle.\n\nIn the STEPS, EV sales (excluding 2/3Ws) reach almost 45 million in 2030 and close to 65 million in 2035, up from around 14 million in 2023. The sales share of EVs grows from around 15% in 2023 to almost 40% in 2030 and over 50% in 2035 in the STEPS. In the APS, the sales shares are higher, approaching 45% in 2030 and two-thirds in 2035. In the NZE Scenario, EV sales shares accelerate over the next few years, reaching about 65% in 2030 and 95% in 2035. \n\nElectric vehicle sales by region and scenario, 2030 and 2035\n\nIEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nThe global sales shares of electric light-duty vehicles (LDVs), buses and trucks are fairly similar in both the STEPS and APS to 2030, suggesting that the gap between policy implementation and announced ambitions is small over the near term. This gap grows to 2035, given that many policies are focused on the nearto medium term, while strategy documents outlining ambitions tend to be longersighted. \n\nFurther, the gap between announced ambitions and a global trajectory to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is larger than the policy implementation gap. In the NZE Scenario, 100% of light vehicle sales, including 2/3Ws, cars and vans, are zero-emission vehicles by 2035. This compares to an EV sales share of only around 75% of 2/3Ws and 70% of LDVs in the APS. Ambition for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), in particular, is lagging behind the net zero by 2050 pathway. \n\nThere are, however, differences by region. China, Europe and the United States, \n- the largest vehicle and EV markets today - all have both ambitious targets and ambitious policies to achieve those targets. This is well illustrated by the extremely small gap between electric car sales in the STEPS and in the APS in 2030. In fact, electric car sales in 2030 in the STEPS in China, Europe and the United States together reach a sales share of over 60%, close to the global electric car sales share in the NZE Scenario. For other countries with less developed markets, the \n\nElectric vehicle sales share by mode and scenario, 2030 and 2035\n\nLight-duty vehicles (LDVs), including passenger light-duty vehicles (PLDVs) and light commercial vehicles (LCVs), are expected to continue to make up the majority of EVs (excluding 2/3Ws) through 2035. This is a result of strong policy support, including light-duty vehicle fuel economy and CO2 standards, as well as the availability of EV models and, more generally, the sheer size of the LDV market. For example, over the past year, Canada and the United Kingdom implemented policies to increase zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales in 2030, targeting 60% and 80% of PLDVs, respectively. \n\nAs a result, electric LDV sales are projected to triple to over 43 million in 2030 in the STEPS, accounting for 40% of total LDV sales. By 2035, sales reach 60 million, representing a share of almost 55%. In this scenario, the number of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars on the roads worldwide is set to decline over time as the number of electric cars grows. The stock of electric LDVs reaches about 245 million in 2030, meaning that almost one in six LDVs on the road is electric. In 2035, electric LDV stock increases to 505 million: approximately one out of three LDVs on the road. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 462, "text": "Passenger light-duty vehicle stock by powertrain and scenario, 2023-2035 In the APS, sales of electric LDVs reach 47 million in 2030 and 75 million in 2035, representing two-thirds of sales in 2035. This reflects government electrification ambitions and net zero pledges, such as the Zero Emission Vehicles Declaration to achieve 100% zero-emission LDV sales by 2040, and by 2035 in leading markets, which has been signed by 40 national governments spanning six continents. The fleet of electric LDVs reaches more than 565 million in 2035, representing one in three LDVs. Of these, 525 million are electric PLDVs, with only 7% being LCVs.\n\nChina is set to remain the leading region for electric LDV sales in the STEPS, though its share in global sales is expected to shrink from almost 60% in 2023 to around 40% in 2030 and 2035. The relative decline in China's global share is due in part to the United States nearly doubling its share of global electric LDV sales to around one-fifth in both 2030 and 2035, thanks to a combination of policy efforts and industry ramp-up (see below). Despite strong growth in electric LDV sales in the STEPS, Europe's share of global sales remains broadly stable through 2035, at around 25%.\n\nThe stock of 2/3Ws is currently the most electrified among all road transport segments, with around 65 million electric 2/3Ws on the road today, representing about 8% of the fleet. In the STEPS, the number of electric 2/3Ws reaches 210 million by 2030 and 360 million in 2035, over one-third of the total fleet. \n\nThis trend has been supported by policy measures such as purchase subsidies in countries including India and Indonesia, and targets for electrifying the 2/3W fleet, predominantly in emerging and developing economies, which represent 90% of the global conventional 2/3Ws stock today. For example, the Dominican Republic aims for 5% of the private motorcycle fleet to be electric by 2030, Pakistan targets 50% electric 2/3W sales by 2030, and Rwanda targets a 30% fleet share of electric 2/3Ws. In the APS, the stock grows to 430 million in 2035, meaning 40% of all 2/3Ws on the roads are electric. The sales share of electric 2/3Ws in 2035 reaches 60% in the STEPS and 75% in the APS. China is the front-runner, with a sales share of around 90% by 2035 in both scenarios. \n\nIn the NZE Scenario, the global electric 2/3W sales share reaches close to 80% \nby 2030 and 100% by 2035. Getting on track with the NZE Scenario is achievable with no technological breakthroughs or major market adaptations. Given the light weight and limited daily driving distance of 2/3Ws, electrification is relatively easy and already makes economic sense on a total cost of ownership basis in many countries. However, unlike for cars, vans and HDVs, there are currently no global initiatives to reach 100% zero-emission 2/3W sales. Strengthening regulations on emissions (or even noise pollution) from 2/3Ws can play a key role in increasing the adoption of electric 2/3Ws, along with purchase subsidies to ease any barriers for lower-income households presented by higher purchase prices compared to ICE 2/3Ws. \n\nIn recent years, a number of governments have announced new funding for electric and zero-emission buses. For example, the United Kingdom has launched a second iteration of its zero emission bus programme that will provide GBP 129 million (almost USD 160 million) to support deployment over the next few years. As announced in late 2023, India is targeting 50 000 electric buses on its roads by 2027. There are also longer-standing programmes, such as the Zero Emission Bus Rapid-deployment Accelerator partnership that was launched in 2019 to accelerate the deployment of zero-emission buses in major Latin American cities.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 463, "text": "Funding programmes of this kind, and heavy-duty vehicles regulations, including the European Union's revised CO2 emission standards for HDVs and California's Advanced Clean Fleets, are expected to increase the sales shares of electric buses. In the STEPS, electric bus sales increase fourteen-fold from 2023 levels, to about half a million in 2035, representing 30% of bus sales. The stock reaches 4.5 million in 2035 in the STEPS, or 20% of the total. \n\nThere are also ambitious targets for electrifying bus fleets, including Chile (100% \nzero-emission vehicle sales for public transport by 2035), Colombia (100% zeroemission bus sales by 2035), Chinese Taipei (full conversion of the urban bus fleet to electric by 2030), Ecuador (100% electric new public transport vehicles by 2025), and Israel (all new municipal buses to be electric by 2025). Further, the Philippines and Solomon Islands recently joined countries including the Dominican Republic, Nepal, Pakistan and Panama in setting specific targets for decarbonising their bus fleets.24 Perhaps the biggest push for electric buses in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) has been at the city level. \n\nJakarta, Indonesia, aims to electrify its fleet of 10 000 buses by 2030, with the first 100 purchased in late 2023. Uzbekistan aims to purchase 300 electric buses in its capital Tashkent and in Samarkand. Buenos Aires is targeting a 50% zeroemission bus fleet by 2030, and a wider study of 32 Latin American cities expects that 25 000 electric buses will be deployed by 2030, and 55 000 by 2050. \n\nSuch targets mean that in the APS, sales of electric buses in 2035 are almost 40% higher than in the STEPS, reaching almost 1 million sales. One in four buses on the road in 2035 is electric. In the NZE Scenario, electric bus sales reach significantly higher levels: by 2035, almost 90% of bus sales are electric. \n\nZero emissions vehicles could achieve total cost of ownership parity in many HDV \napplications this decade, including long-haul trucks, according to recent research. \n\nAnd the adoption of stringent emissions standards could also help to make electric options more attractive by increasing the cost of ICE buses and trucks. Nevertheless, medium- and heavy-duty trucks may prove more difficult to electrify than other segments, in part due to the size and weight of their batteries, as well as charging requirements. \n\nRecent emissions standards in the United States and European Union will support electric HDV adoption in the coming years. In the STEPS, sales increase more than 30-fold by 2035, albeit from around 54 000 in 2023. As a result, more than 20% of medium- and heavy-duty truck sales are electric in 2035. \n\nAt COP 28, six countries25 joined the Global Memorandum of Understanding on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles (Global MOU), bringing the total to 33 nations26 committed to reaching 100% zero-emission sales in 2040 and 30% by 2030. In aggregate, these signatories currently represent almost 25% of the global medium- and heavy-duty truck market. This brings the global electric truck sales share in the APS close to 30% in 2035.\n\nIn the NZE Scenario, electric truck sales represent over 55% of total medium- and heavy-duty truck sales in 2035. \n\nElectric vehicle sales share by mode and region, 2035\n\nNotes: STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; APS = Announced Pledges Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario; 2/3Ws = two/three-wheelers; LDVs = light-duty vehicles; BEV = battery electric vehicle; PHEV = plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. See the annex for regional groupings. Regional projected EV sales and sales shares data can be explored in the interactive Global EV Data Explorer. \n\nThe current momentum in electric car sales has led to anticipation in China that passenger new energy vehicle (NEV) sales could reach a 50% share as soon as 2025, as stated in the recent Automotive Industry Green and Low-Carbon Development Roadmap 1.0 developed under the supervision of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. If this materialises, it would be a decade ahead of the 50% sales in 2035 target laid out in the Energy-saving and New Energy Vehicle Technology Roadmap 2.0 published just a few years ago. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 464, "text": "Moreover, it would be well above the official target of 20% new energy car sales by 2025, and would even exceed the recently announced 45% NEV sales share target for 2027.\n\nAfter achieving this milestone, the sales share of electric cars and vans continues to grow in the STEPS, exceeding two-thirds of total sales in 2030 and almost reaching 85% in 2035. Given that the current trend is tracking ahead of government targets, the electric LDV sales shares are the same for STEPS and APS through 2035. However, it will be critical for China to roll out public charging infrastructure in a timely manner to enable such growth. Electric LDVs are generally cost-competitive in China even at purchase, and so the phasing out of EV purchase subsidies in 2023 is unlikely to affect further growth. Announced EV \nbattery manufacturing capacity is well above projected sales share (see below), \nwith an eye to potential exports, and so even higher shares are theoretically achievable.\n\nChina is also the global leader in terms of electric share of the 2/3W fleet, with over one-third of all 2/3Ws being electric today, and is expected to remain the leader in electric 2/3W sales in both the STEPS and APS. In the STEPS, the sales share of electric 2/3Ws reaches nearly 90% in 2035; in the APS, the share is slightly above that by 2035. China also has one of the highest stock shares of electric buses, with more than one in four buses being electric. By 2035, the sales share of electric buses increases to over 70% in both scenarios, up from 50% in 2023. While sales of electric medium- and heavy-duty trucks are significantly lower than other road modes, China held over 90% of the world's total global electric truck stock in 2023. \n\nElectric truck sales are projected to reach a sales share of almost 50% in 2035 in both scenarios. \n\nThe sales share of EVs across all road transport modes (excluding 2/3Ws) reaches around 80% in 2035 in both scenarios. Across all modes, the current market dynamics, and the policy landscape as considered in the STEPS to 2035, are sufficient to bring EV sales shares into line with China's ambition of climate neutrality by 2060, as well as with provincial electrification targets. As such, in China there is no gap between existing policy frameworks and future targets, and even more ambition is conceivable.\n\nEurope remains one of the most advanced EV markets under stated policies. Last year, the United Kingdom passed the Vehicle Emissions Trading Schemes Order 2023, which mandates certain sales shares of zero-emission cars and vans, setting a target for annual ZEV sales shares for cars to increase from 22% in 2024 to 80% in 2030. Considering the policy landscape across Europe, including the UK ZEV mandate and the EU CO2 standards for cars and vans, the sales share of electric LDVs in Europe reaches nearly 60% in 2030 and 85% in 2035 in the STEPS. The ZEV sales share in 2035 does not reach 100% for a couple of reasons. First, in the United Kingdom, the annual ZEV targets for 2031-2035 have not yet been set out in the legislation and thus the 100% ZEV sales target for 2035 is not reflected in the STEPS. Secondly, the European car market includes national markets that are not covered by such strong regulations as in the European Union and the United Kingdom. \n\nGiven that the European Union has legislated to the level of its climate and EV ambitions (resulting in zero-emission LDV sales reaching 100% in 2035), and since the United Kingdom has also passed legislation for zero-emission LDVs, at least through 2030, the EV sales shares in the APS are similar to in the STEPS.

{"doc_id": 465, "text": "Electric LDVs represent over 60% of sales in 2030 and over 90% of sales in 2035 in the APS. For buses and trucks, the revised EU HDV CO2 standards drive up electric HDV \nsales in the STEPS. The standards will require 100% of city bus sales to be zeroemission from 2035, and other HDVs to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 45% in 2030, 65% in 2035 and 90% from 2040, compared to 2019 levels. A number of European countries also offer grants and other financial support for the purchase of electric buses and trucks. For example, the second round of Zero Emission Bus Regional Areas (ZEBRA) funding in the United Kingdom is expected to add an additional 955 zero-emission buses to the UK fleet. In the STEPS, the sales shares of electric buses and trucks reach around 65% and 35% in 2035 in Europe. \n\nWithin the European Union, sales are higher, reaching shares of 80% for buses and around 50% for trucks in 2035. \n\nThe APS takes into account the ambitions of the 18 European national governments who have signed the Global MOU on Zero-Emission Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles, committing to reach 30% zero-emission HDV sales shares in 2030 and 100% in 2040. Other targets are also included in the APS, such as the UK aim to phase out the sale of any heavy goods vehicles weighing 26 tonnes and under that are not zero emissions by 2035. As a result, in Europe in the APS, electric bus sales reach around 80% in 2035 and electric truck sales almost 45%. In Europe, the EV sales share across all modes (excluding 2/3Ws) is 85% in 2035 in the STEPS. In the APS, Europe has a combined EV sales share of over 90% in 2035 (for electric LDVs, buses and trucks), which is in line with the global trajectory in the NZE Scenario.\n\nElectric car sales are expected to continue growing in the United States, thanks to successive policies that are driving up adoption. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Model Years 2024-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks requires fuel economy improvements that are likely to increase the share of EV sales in just the next few years. From 2026, California's Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, which have been adopted by twelve other states and Washington DC,\n27 will begin to further increase zero-emission PLDV sales, with the stated aim of reaching 100% by 2035. Combined, these states represent around one-third of light-duty vehicle sales in the United States, with a significant impact on overall electric car sales and, therefore, on OEM strategy. This could create a ripple effect across the wider market, as OEMs harmonise around the regulations in order to bring down production costs through standardisation. In addition, in March 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also released the final rulemaking for Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles, which it estimates could bring electric PLDV sales to around 70% of total sales in 2032.\n\nThe United States is also supporting an expansion of charging infrastructure to support increased EV adoption. At the end of 2023, construction of the first EV \nchargers funded under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure programme had begun, with around USD 100 million already awarded to projects. There is now around USD 2.5 billion available to states to be allocated to EV charging projects \n(about 60% of the total programme funding). The policy landscape in the United States, combined with already-committed industry investments (see below), is boosting confidence in EV market expansion. \n\nAs a result, electric LDV sales reach approximately 55% in 2030 in the STEPS, \nhigher than the Administration's previously announced target, and hit more than 70% in 2035. Due to the recent policy developments, the electric LDV sales in the STEPS match government ambition and thus are the same as in the APS. Funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the US EPA has awarded almost USD 2 billion to fund approximately 5 000 school bus replacements, with another USD 3 billion to be provided to 2026, as part of the Clean School Bus Program.

With respect to trucks, 11 states, representing around one-quarter of HDV sales in the country, have adopted California's Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, which sets ZEV sales requirements for trucks that range from 40-75% in 2035. Bringing the national standards more in line with the Californian regulation, the US EPA finalised GHG \nstandards for HDVs for model years 2028-2032, which aims to reduce emissions from trucks and heavy buses by 25-60% in 2032 compared to 2026. In the STEPS, \nthe electric truck sales share across the United States reaches around 50% in 2035. \n\nThe United States is also a signatory of the Global MOU, which targets 30% zeroemission M/HDV sales shares by 2030 (on aggregate, across bus and truck sales) \nand 100% by 2040. In the APS, the US electric bus sales share reaches around 75% in 2035 and the electric truck sales share reaches almost 70% in 2035.\n\nThe EV sales share across all modes (excluding 2/3Ws) reaches more than 70% \nin both the STEPS and the APS in 2035. \n\nJapan has fuel economy standards for both light- and heavy-duty vehicles, and offers purchase subsidies for EVs. Historically, Japan has also had a relatively high sales share of hybrid (non-plug-in) vehicles, as one way to reduce emissions from cars and improve the average fuel economy. In the STEPS, the electric LDV sales share increases from about 3% in 2023 to around 20% in 2030, and 30% in 2035. In Japan's Green Growth Strategy, the government sets a target for 100% of new car sales to be electrified by 2035 - for which their definition includes BEVs, PHEV, FCEV and hybrid electric vehicles \n(HEVs). In the APS, which reflects this target, about 70% of LDV sales in 2035 are electric (BEV or PHEV). With respect to HDVs, electric bus sales reach about 25% in 2030 and increase to 50% in 2035 in the STEPS. In the APS, electric bus sales increase to 75% in 2035 to support climate targets.

{"doc_id": 467, "text": "India's Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) \nII scheme, which provided subsidies for EVs and funding for EV charging, ended on 31 March 2024. The Ministry of Heavy Industries announced in March 2024 a limited scheme for the period between 1 April 2024 and 31 July 2024, which outlays over INR 4.9 billion (Indian rupees) (almost USD 60 million) to subsidise electric 2/3W purchases. This may be a stopgap until the announcement of a FAME III scheme, which is expected to detail new subsidy provisions for EVs. In addition, the government's Production Linked Incentive scheme for Automobile and Auto Components and for manufacturing of Advanced Chemistry Cell Battery Storage aims to attract investments in domestic EV and battery manufacturing. Based on the current policy landscape, electric LDVs represent one in four LDVs sold in India in 2035. The APS takes into account that India signed the COP 26 declaration to transition to 100% zero-emission LDV sales by 2040. As such, electric LDV sales in 2035 reach over 60% in the APS. India has the largest stock of two-wheelers of any country and represents almost 30% of the global stock of three-wheelers. Electrifying the 2/3W segment will therefore be important for decarbonising India's road transport system. India has made good progress to date, and almost a quarter of the country's three-wheelers are electric. The sales share of electric 2/3Ws increases from around 8% in 2023 to almost 60% in 2035 in the STEPS. In the APS the electric sales share reaches 70% in 2035. As announced at COP 28, India is aiming to reach a stock of 50 000 electric buses by 2027, backed by a USD 390 million fund supported by both the Indian and US \ngovernments to provide loans to expand electric bus manufacturing. In both the STEPS and the APS, electric bus sales shares increase to about 35% in 2030 and 60% in 2035. Electric truck sales remain low in both scenarios to 2035, at under 10%. Across all modes (including 2/3Ws), the EV sales share in India is about 50% in 2035 in the STEPS (and closer to 25% if 2/3Ws are excluded). In the APS, EV \nsales shares in India scale up to over 65% in 2035 across all road vehicle modes (and to almost 60% excluding 2/3Ws).\n\nEach year, more and more countries around the world are setting out a clear vision or targets for electromobility. However, in emerging and developing economies, in particular, adoption of EVs can be hindered by limited funding available for fiscal incentives and other measures to overcome purchase price hurdles. Importantly, there are still some 750 million people without access to electricity, mainly in subSaharan Africa, and others with grid reliability issues, which also affects the prospects for charging EVs. However, efforts are being made to support governments in EMDEs to advance deployment of EVs, such as through the Global Electric Mobility Programme, as well as proposed reforms that could improve financing options from Multilateral Development Banks. In many EMDEs, the main targets of vehicle electrification initiatives are 2/3Ws and public transport. In Colombia, for example, there has been a major focus on electrifying mass transportation systems (buses), cargo vehicles and taxis. \n\nTargets for electric 2/3Ws have been set in countries as diverse as Cambodia, Morocco and the Dominican Republic.\n\nIn the STEPS, the average EV sales share across regions and countries outside of those described in the preceding sections is about 45% for 2/3Ws, 20% for buses, 18% for LDVs and 3% for trucks in 2035. In the APS, sales across these other regions reach 65% of 2/3Ws, 40% of LDVs, 30% of buses and 10% of trucks. \n\nThe countries that have adopted EV-related policies and set ambitions tend to have higher EV sales shares than these averages. In particular, Canada tends to align with the most ambitious standards in North America. In December 2023, Canada amended its GHG regulations to include new requirements to increase the availability of zero-emission passenger cars and light trucks, targeting at least 20% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2026, at least 60% by 2030 and 100% zeroemission vehicle sales by 2035.

{"doc_id": 468, "text": "As of 2023, the ten largest global automakers all have established clear electrification targets. Together, these automakers sold over 40 million cars in 2023, representing about 55% of global sales. Although some manufacturers have missed or postponed near-term targets - often pointing to underwhelming consumer demand - they have not scaled back their longer-term ambitions. If each company in the top ten meets their target, over 20 million new electric cars could be sold in 2030. Notable examples include BMW's target of 50% of deliveries in 2030 to be BEVs; Toyota's 3.5 million BEV sales target in 2030; Stellantis's 5 million BEV sales target in 2030; and GM's target of a global EV manufacturing capacity of 2 million per year by 2025. In addition, Tesla is targeting production of 20 million electric cars in 2030, which - combined with the targets of the top ten - would be roughly equivalent to the projected sales in the STEPS in that year.\n\nIn total, more than 20 OEMs, together representing over 90% of car sales in 2023, have set some sort of target for future EV deployment. The global electric car sales envisaged in announcements by manufacturers have increased by several percentage points based on developments over the past year. If all manufacturers' targets on vehicle electrification are combined, between 42% and 58% of car sales in 2030 could be electric. This range encompasses the sales share for cars in the STEPS (almost 45%) and the share implied by government ambitions in the APS (almost 50%). Regional examples include:\n In China, major carmakers, including incumbents, have increased their electrification ambitions. For example, SAIC and Geely are targeting 50% NEV \nsales by 2025. \n\nSeveral important car makers have also announced a phase-out date for ICE vehicle sales. For example, ICE phase-outs have been announced by Jaguar from 2025, Mini and Rolls-Royce from the beginning of the 2030s, Lexus from 2035, Land Rover from 2036, and Honda from 2040. 28 Combined, these brands represented over 5% of global car sales in 2023. Even more automakers have pledged to phase out ICE vehicle sales in the European market specifically, including include Ford, Volkswagen, Stellantis, Lancia, Renault and Nissan. \n\nBattery and EV manufacturers have faced new challenges and opportunities as major markets including the United States and the European Union introduced new industrial policies. Domestic content requirements introduced by these policies have supported the expansion plans of major battery and EV manufacturers, with billions in investments already committed as of early 2024. \n\nWorldwide, reported investment announcements from 2022 and 2023 alone exceed USD 275 billion in EVs and USD 195 billion in batteries, with around USD 190 billion of the total already committed. The level of investments observed in the past 2 years boosts confidence in the electrification of road transport.\n\nIn **China**, committed battery manufacturing capacity is well above what is needed to supply domestic electric car sales in 2030. In fact, just two-thirds of the alreadycommitted battery cell manufacturing capacity would be sufficient to cover 100% \nof electric car sales in China in 2030. This excess capacity, which is today driving down margins, implies that battery producers are banking on export markets, at least in part. This will bring both opportunities and challenges. Countries that have electrification targets but lack sufficient battery manufacturing capacity could reach these targets through imports from China, whereas companies outside of China will see increased competition from the arrival of Chinese manufacturers.\n\nGovernments will seek to find the right balance between supporting local producers at the same time as ensuring consumers can benefit from the low prices offered by Chinese manufacturers, which would accelerate road electrification.

Now, to qualify for the tax credit of up to USD 7 500, vehicle assembly must take place in North America and meet the critical minerals and battery components requirements. 29 In December 2023, guidance was released defining the \"Foreign Entities of Concern\" as part of the tax credit exclusions: vehicles with batteries containing components manufactured or assembled by a foreign entity of concern (which includes China) cannot qualify for the tax credit. The number of eligible electric car models has therefore fallen from more than 40 in the second half of 2023 to around 27 from the beginning of January 2024.30 In 2025, restrictions may be expanded such that EVs cannot qualify if their batteries contain any critical minerals that were extracted, processed, or recycled by a foreign entity of concern. From September 2022 to the end of 2023, after the IRA was signed into law, investments of more than USD 60 billion were announced to support the EV \nindustry, in EV manufacturing, charging and batteries in the United States.31 The vast majority - about 80% - of these investments are for batteries; with just around USD 5 billion announced for EVs, though there are, of course, strong links between battery manufacturing and EV manufacturing. For example, in February 2024, Volkswagen-backed Scout Motors started building a USD 2 billion electric sports utility vehicle (SUV) manufacturing plant in South Carolina. In mid-2023, BMW broke ground on their high-voltage battery manufacturing plant (USD 700 million) to supply batteries for their announced EV production lines \n(USD 1 billion) in South Carolina. Hyundai-Kia, which in 2023 overtook GM and Ford in terms of electric car sales share, plans to manufacture EVs in the state of Georgia by October 2024 to qualify for IRA benefits. Announced battery manufacturing expansions in the United States, in part resulting from signals sent by the IRA, would be more than enough to satisfy carmaker electrification targets and government ambitions in 2030. Of course, the announced investments in battery manufacturing will first need to be realised, and we estimate that it would require around USD 100 billion in capital expenditures32 to reach the level of battery manufacturing capacity necessary to meet demand for electric cars in 2030 in the APS. According to the Clean Investment Monitor, actual expenditures in EV battery manufacturing from 2020 to 2023 totalled around USD 45 billion. Around 45% of the capital expenditure (CAPEX) needed for battery manufacturing has therefore already been spent. \n\nIn the **European Union**, the Net Zero Industry Act and the subsequent relaxing of state aid rules in March 2023 are boosting public support for road transport electrification. For example, in January 2024, Swedish battery maker Northvolt received approval for EUR 700 million in direct grant and EUR 200 million in guarantee from Germany, which was described as \"proportionate and limited to the minimum necessary to trigger the investment in Europe\". Northvolt's project is expected to require a total investment of EUR 4.5 billion, creating 3 000 jobs and starting battery manufacturing in 2026. The company also secured a USD 5 billion green loan - touted as the largest green loan in Europe to date - with the support of European and Korean banks and export credit agencies. The loan will enable further expansion for the production of cathodes, cell manufacturing and a recycling plant in northern Sweden. As of 2024, the market signals provided by the Net Zero Industry Act have been sufficient to attract enough committed investments in battery manufacturing capacity in the European Union to satisfy government electrification targets out to 2030. Across the whole of Europe, committed investments come close to meeting these targets. While investments that are already committed today tend to be more heavily geared towards battery than to EV manufacturing, it is important to note that battery manufacturing and EV expansion plans typically go hand in hand, often being situated close to demand centres to create integrated supply chains. This close collaboration is important in order to deliver on targets, avoid bottlenecks and decrease costs. In addition, in the event that committed EV battery manufacturing capacity outpaces demand from EV manufacturers, it is unlikely that it would find alternative outlets, as other key battery markets such as consumer electronics are already well supplied and have different technical specifications. Failure to deliver on EV manufacturing capacity and sales therefore creates a risk of massive sunk investment in battery manufacturing, if manufacturers are unable to export significant quantities.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}

Committed refers to plants that have reached a final investment decision and are starting or have already started construction works. Battery manufacturing capacity refers to the mobility sector only and assumes utilisation factors of 85%.\n\nSources: IEA analysis based on companies announcements and data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, Bloomberg New Energy Finance and EV Volumes. \n\nFor example, in Europe, Volkswagen benefits from close co-operation with two of the biggest regional battery manufacturers, LG Energy Solutions and Samsung, which together provide batteries for 95% of Volkswagen's European electric car sales. In China, on the other hand, Volkswagen works with CATL, which provides almost all the batteries for its Chinese electric car sales. Similarly, Tesla works with Panasonic's Nevada plant in the United States, but with CATL and LG Energy Solutions in China. When considering expansion plans, battery manufacturers often seek to bring operations closer to the production facilities of partner OEMs. CATL is currently developing manufacturing facilities in Hungary to provide regional car makers like Stellantis, which sources nearly 50% of its European EV \nbatteries from CATL and the other half from LG and Samsung SDI. A similar trend is already observable outside of the biggest EV markets, such as in Türkiye, where the Turkish brand Togg and Farasis Energy created a joint venture in April 2023. \n\nDuring 2023 the Togg T10X model reached almost 20 000 registrations in Türkiye, becoming the fourth most sold car model in November 2023. Continued co-operation between EV and battery makers is expected to continue to support road transport electrification into the future. As of early 2024, half of the committed battery manufacturing capacity in the United States will be delivered by joint ventures between an EV and a battery manufacturer (e.g. LG-GM, LG-\nHonda, LG-Hyundai, Samsung-GM, Samsung-Stellantis, Panasonic-Tesla, LGToyota, SKI-Ford, SKI-Hyundai). Many similar joint ventures are seen in Europe \n(e.g. Northvolt-Volvo, Envision-Nissan). There are even joint ventures for battery components, such as between Volkswagen and Umicore to produce battery cathodes. Globally, on the basis of industry announcements, committed battery manufacturing capacity in 2030 would be sufficient to support the electric car sales share reaching more than 55%, higher than the sales shares implied by automaker targets and both the STEPS and APS projections. In fact, the committed and existing battery manufacturing capacity would meet over 90% of the EV battery demand in the NZE Scenario in 2030. \n\nA few new announcements on zero-emission vehicle strategies have been seen in the HDV market, such as the agreement signed by Hino Motors Sales USA that could result in the delivery of up to 10 000 electric trucks by 2030. For the United States, the range of OEM targets in 2030 encompasses the zero-emission vehicle sales shares in the STEPS (around 20%). Chinese OEM Foton has also announced a target of 50% NEV sales by 2030. Similarly, BAIC Trucks also plans to sell 50% new energy trucks by 2030 and 80% \nby 2035. On aggregate, OEM targets would imply that zero-emission truck sales represent 13-32% of Chinese truck sales in 2030. \n\nThere have been no big announcements from truck makers in Europe over the past year, but OEM targets for this market still exceed what would be necessary under the EU HDV CO2 standard, as reflected in the STEPS sales share. \n\nZero-emission heavy-duty vehicle sales shares implied by original equipment manufacturer targets and projected in the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges Scenarios, 2030 Range of OEM declarations (estimate) Stated Policies Scenario (2030) Announced Pledges Scenario (2030) 2023 IEA.

OEM pledges cover the European Union and the European Free Trade Association whose members are Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The figure compares OEM targets for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) (which for some OEMs include buses) relative to IEA projections for zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty truck sales (including fuel cell electric vehicles). Since annual sales of trucks substantially outnumber sales of buses, achieving HDV targets will require selling zero-emission trucks, which is currently more challenging than selling electric buses. The regional average market share in 2030 is calculated by collating announcements that explicitly mention zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) market shares or ZEV sales by the top 10-25 OEMs in each region. Electric bus and truck registrations and stock data can be interactively explored via the Global EV Data Explorer. \n\nLarge-scale adoption of EVs hinges on the simultaneous roll-out of accessible and affordable charging. The early adopters of electric cars have tended to live in single-family detached homes with affordable and convenient access to home charging. As a result, most charging to date has been private (at home and other private locations). At the same time, public chargers have tended to be installed in urban areas, where utilisation rates are likely to be higher. Looking forward, however, chargers must also be installed outside of urban areas to enable continued adoption beyond cities and suburbs. \n\nIn a 2021 survey of EV drivers in the United Kingdom, over 90% of the respondents reported having access to home chargers, whereas a 2023 study showed that only 55% of Indian consumers had such access. The build-out of charging in workplaces and publicly accessible areas will be key for increasing adoption among groups without access to home charging. Charging speed - slow or fast - is also an important consideration for consumers looking to switch to electric, especially when considering a vehicle for long journeys. Charging services should also be easy to use, reliable and transparently priced. Further, ensuring interoperability is important when making investments in charging infrastructure and services, so that a wide customer base is able to benefit. \n\nIn the STEPS and APS, the global number of public charging points exceeds 15 million by 2030, up four-fold compared to the almost 4 million operating in 2023. \n\nBy 2035, this number reaches almost 25 million in the APS, a sixfold increase relative to 2023. Among today's major EV markets, China is where the population's access to home charging is most limited and where public charging has been most widely rolled out as a result. China accounted for 70% of global public LDV charging in 2023 and is expected to remain a leader with a similar share in 2035 in the STEPS. \n\nWhile the current availability of public chargers in China already appears to be above the global average (<10 electric LDVs per public charging point), the government recently issued new guidelines for deploying high-quality charging infrastructure. The number of electric LDVs per public charging point increases from around 10 in 2023 to around 15 in 2035 in the APS, remaining lower than other major markets.\n\nCurrently, China has one of the highest shares of fast chargers out of total public charging stock, at around 45%. In both the STEPS and APS, the stock of public fast chargers reaches around 7.5 million in 2035, almost six times 2023 levels. \n\nThe number of slow chargers reaches 8.2 million in 2035 in the APS. \n\nIn Europe, the stock of public LDV chargers increases to around 2.7 million in 2035 in both the STEPS and APS, up from about 730 000 in 2023. In both scenarios, roughly 80% of the European public charging stock is in the European Union, or around 2.3 million chargers in 2035. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 472, "text": "Policies focused on charging infrastructure play an important role in increasing the number of charging points per EV. Specifically, the EU Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) requires member states to ensure publicly accessible charging stations offer in aggregate at least 1.3 kW of power output per BEV and 0.8 kW per PHEV. The capacity requirements can be relaxed once 15% \nbattery electric stock share has been reached. In the APS, the average charging capacity per EV is close to 1 kW, despite over 80% of electric LDVs being battery electric, given that battery electric LDVs reach a 30% stock share. The AFIR \nregulation also requires that from 2025 onward, DC fast charging (at least 150 kW) \nbe installed every 60 km along the EU Trans-European Transport Network\n(TEN-T). As such, the share of fast chargers is set to increase from the 2023 share of approximately 15%.\n\nThe United Kingdom expects to install at least 300 000 public chargers by 2030. \n\nIn the APS, the roll-out of public chargers is slightly slower but maintains adequate coverage in terms of charging capacity available, with the stock reaching only 220 000 in 2030, with 1.2 kW of charging capacity per electric LDV available, and reaching 300 000 5 years later in 2035. Considering the stock of electric LDVs approaches 20 million in 2035 in the APS, this corresponds to over 60 electric LDVs per public charging point, up from around 30 in 2023.\n\nIn the United States, the government has announced nearly USD 50 million to subsidise projects that aim to expand access to convenient charging, in line with its objective of building a national network of 500 000 public EV charging ports by 2030. In the APS, the number of public chargers reaches 900 000 in 2030 and 1.7 million in 2035, many of which will likely be funded by private investment and go beyond highway corridors. This translates to about 55 electric LDVs per charging point in 2035. Japan's Green Growth Strategy aims to deploy 150 000 charging points by 2030, including 30 000 fast chargers, with the objective of reaching a comparable level of comfort as for refuelling conventional vehicles. In the APS, the number of LDV \ncharging points reaches 160 000 by 2030, of which approximately 55 000 are fast chargers. By 2035, the number of public charging points reaches 190 000 in the APS. The number of electric LDVs per public charging point increases from around 18 in 2023 to over 80 in 2035 in the APS. \n\nIn India, FAME II has offered financial support and set targets for charging infrastructure, such as the requirement for chargers to be installed every 25 km along major highways. Additionally, in March 2023, the Ministry of Heavy Industries announced financial aid for the development of charging infrastructure. In the APS, the ratio of electric LDVs per public charging point remains low, like in China, with the number of charging points projected to reach almost 2 million by 2035 in order to supply around 25 million electric LDVs.\n\nFollowing the formal adoption of the EU AFIR in 2023, EU member states are now implementing the regulation through the public and private entities that operate European motorway networks. This process is helping to build up the knowledge base on how to ensure that reliable charging points are deployed quickly and effectively through competitive tendering, thereby fostering the emerging market for EV charging infrastructure. Key learnings include:\n\nCarrying out a market consultation with charging point operators (CPOs) ahead of publishing a tender can help to ensure that the tenders are designed to encourage bids that follow best practices and use the latest technologies in this emerging sector. \n\nTenders should include criteria to ensure that EV charging stations are well designed and easily accessible. This includes making sure that charging stations have sufficient space to accommodate EVs of different sizes, including HDVs, camper vans and vehicles with caravans, as well as users with limited mobility, so that drivers are not required to perform potentially dangerous manoeuvres. Criteria can also be designed to ensure that chargers can service the newest generation of BEVs, as well as older models, and that sites have the potential to expand as the EV market increases.

{"doc_id": 473, "text": "For successful long-term operation and ensuring EV drivers are not dissuaded, CPOs need to be held accountable for providing a reliable service. Competitive tenders should set criteria for quality, with penalties for those that do not meet required standards, for example 99% uptime and regular charger maintenance. Further, selection criteria can be used to ensure chargers are smart-ready, able to share data within the charging ecosystem, provide fair and transparent pricing, and meet interoperability obligations. \n\nCharging stations located at sites with higher traffic often have a higher utilisation rate and thus are more profitable than those with lower traffic. In order to prevent CPOs from only bidding on the most desirable locations, tenders can bundle the motorway locations into several \"lots\" composed of higher- and lower-traffic sites.\n\nGiven that the EV market is still relatively nascent, many EV charging stations will not be profitable for a number of years. ChargeUp Europe, an industry association, recommends that a contract duration of at least 15 years is necessary for CPOs to recover initial investments and for sites to become profitable. In general, the lower the current EV stock share, the longer the tender terms should be for CPOs to feel confident in the business proposition.\n\nFurther, to best enable CPOs to assess the business case for a tender, only one CPO should be selected to serve each service area, as is the case with conventional petrol stations. The presence of multiple CPOs makes it very difficult to predict revenues given low EV penetration rates. Different CPOs could be selected on consecutive service areas to provide greater customer choice and market competition. Local monopolies should be avoided. \n\nEstablishing a grid connection can be a lengthy, complex process, which can delay development of charging stations. To overcome this potential hurdle, motorway operators can request grid connections in advance of or in parallel to issuing a tender. Governments can also set requirements for grid operators to respond to requests within a set time and ensure there are no conflicts of interest between grid operators and parties requesting grid connections. In countries where grid operators also operate as CPOs, they can be in direct competition with operators requesting connections. \n\nStatistics on the availability of home chargers are scattered, and our analysis therefore assumes that access to home charging covers 50-80% of the electric LDV fleet, based on various surveys, depending on the share of population residing in dense urban areas.33 We estimate that globally there were 27 million home chargers in operation in 2023, or 150 GW of charging capacity and 1.6 electric LDVs per home charger. The stock grows more than tenfold by 2035 in the STEPS to reach over 270 million. In the APS, the home charger stock reaches around 300 million in 2035. \n\nThe stock of other private chargers increases up to 14-fold by 2035 in the APS, \nwhile public chargers increase sixfold. In both scenarios, the charging capacity offered by public chargers in 2035 is higher than that offered by private chargers outside of homes. In total, there are an estimated 1.2 electric LDVs per charging point, including public and private, 2035 in the APS, up from just over 1 in 2023. Even with access to home charging, EV owners rely to some extent on public charging. As EV adoption broadens, the share of charging from other private or public charging stations (in terms of electricity delivered to vehicles) is expected to grow over time. By 2035, the share of electricity coming from chargers other than home chargers reaches almost 45%, compared to less than 35% in 2023. \n\nFor commercial vehicle operators, similarly to owners of personal EVs, overnight charging of electric HDVs at depots offers a convenient way to charge stationary vehicles. Charging overnight also has the benefit of being able to charge at relatively low power rates given the amount of time available. This kind of charging strategy requires a close to one-to-one ratio of depot charger per electric HDV. \n\nIn the near term, it is expected that electrification of HDVs will proceed most quickly for segments with relatively short (under 200 km/day), predictable daily routes, such as city buses, urban and even some regional delivery services. Overnight depot charging could likely meet most of the needs of these fleets. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 474, "text": "In addition, there will also be a role for opportunity chargers. Opportunity chargers can be at the end of a bus line or at a truck loading dock, where vehicles can take advantage of waiting time to charge without disrupting typical operations. Opportunity chargers also include public chargers along motorways that allow for en-route charging. For some HDVs, such as intercity buses and long-haul trucks, en-route fast charging may be needed to supplement depot charging in order to enable long-distance driving. While these segments could be slower to electrify, their relatively high share of activity today - and thus emissions - mean they will be important to decarbonise. \n\nOptions other than wired charging could also be used to support electric HDVs, such as electric road systems and battery swapping. In China in particular, battery swapping for trucks may become a widespread means of recharging. However, the current analysis of charger needs does not take into account non-wired charging options, as the future role of these alternative technologies remains uncertain.\n\nHeavy-duty vehicle charger stock and capacity in the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges Scenarios, 2023-2035 In the STEPS, over 99% of HDV chargers are depot chargers in 2030, though about 10% of electricity is provided by opportunity chargers. By 2035, there is greater deployment and utilisation of opportunity chargers, with the stock more than tripling compared to 2030 to reach 100 000 in 2035. In total, the installed capacity of chargers for HDVs reaches 2 000 GW in 2035 in the APS. For reference, the installed global renewable electricity capacity in 2022 was around 3 600 GW. Despite the average capacity of an opportunity charger being assumed to be around four times as high as a depot charger (especially considering the role of MW-scale charging), less than 5% of the total installed capacity for heavy-duty chargers in 2035 is from opportunity chargers. \n\nPolicy has an important role to play in fostering infrastructure roll-out. The EU \nAFIR, for example, includes requirements for coverage of HDV charging points with a power output of at least 350 kW along TEN-T Network by the end of 2025. \n\nIn March 2024, the United States released the National Zero-Emission Freight Corridor Strategy, which aims to guide infrastructure deployment, catalyse public and private investment; and support utility and regulatory planning and action at local, state and regional levels. As of the end of 2023, cumulative private investment in medium- and heavy-duty vehicle charging infrastructure in the United States amounted to USD 4.2 billion. Industry will certainly also play a major role in HDV charging infrastructure development. For example, joint venture Milence plans to build and operate 1 700 HDV charging points in Europe by 2027. \n\nThe CharIN industry alliance is supporting the development of charging systems rated up to 3.75 MW, as well as the associated charging standards. \n\nA key challenge for rolling out charging infrastructure is ensuring that it can provide secure, low-emissions and affordable electricity. Decision makers will need to assess the impacts of HDV charging on the expansion and operation of power systems, and to plan accordingly. In this section, we explore the implications of different HDV charging strategies for power systems, through an analysis at the bulk power system level for three regions (China, the European Union and the United States) and a case study of a local high-voltage grid. We also discuss some strategies and technologies to mitigate the impacts of HDV charging on power grids. EV charging creates both challenges and opportunities for electricity systems. \n\nBeyond local issues such as variations in power quality (e.g. harmonic distortion), \nEV charging can have an impact on electricity systems, mainly via demand-supply imbalances, either locally (e.g. by causing grid congestion) or - if there is a large enough fleet - at the system level. The electricity system impacts of EV charging can be principally understood by a combination of three dimensions: the **when** (at what time and for how long), the **where** (in which location of the grid), and the **how** much (the charging power that the vehicle is using). ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 475, "text": "As an example, EV charging could create stress on the electricity system if it takes place in an area of the grid that is already congested at that time. On the other hand, charging could become a beneficial opportunity if it is possible to charge the fleet at a different time of the day, when there is less congestion or greater renewable power availability, or if it is possible to charge in a different location. This analysis is based on four cases that only differ with regards to the charging location and the power availability. There is no difference in technical parameters such as battery size or average daily mileage. All these cases represent feasible ways of meeting heavy-duty truck charging needs with different charging location options. \n\nEn-route charging is studied under two different cases:\n\nThese cases are similar to the charging taxonomy described in a recent European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E) study on the impacts of heavy-duty EV charging on the power system. \n\nComparison of selected approaches to heavy-duty truck fleet charging and their effects on the electricity load of a 1 000-vehicle **fleet**\n\nNotes: Case 1 represents charging overnight at a depot; Case 2 represents charging during the day at a loading dock in addition to overnight charging; Cases 3 represent en-route fast charging, for example along highways, in addition to overnight charging, with power ratings of either 350 kW or 1 MW. The values plotted are based on a simulation of 1 000 trucks over 24 hours using the IEA Electric Vehicle Charging and Grid Integration Tool. Fleet behaviour is represented by assuming that vehicles arrive, stay and depart at different times because of the underlying probabilistic distribution, resulting in a charging profile that is not fully simultaneous for all vehicles in the fleet. As part of the simulation inputs, it was assumed that each truck has a battery capacity of 500 kWh, consumes 1.4 kWh/km and travels 300 +/- 50 km per day. \n\nElectric truck charging adds to electricity demand from other end uses and can have a significant impact on the average daily load curve, depending on the structure of the underlying demand. For instance, in 2035 in the APS, the United States has an evening peak resulting in part from the charging of passenger cars, while in the European Union and China, midday demand is high because of significant industry consumption. \n\nAcross regions, the largest impacts by 2035 in the APS are in the European Union and the United States, where demand from electric trucks accounts for around 3% \nof total electricity demand. In China, truck charging has less of an impact on total electricity demand profiles in the APS (less than 1% by 2035), as other sectors such as industry play a much larger role. \n\nDifferent charging behaviours can lead to peaks in total system power demand at different times throughout the day. Overnight charging at truck depots increases night-time demand and limits daily load variations, smoothing the truck charging load curve. Opportunity charging (at the loading dock) or en-route charging shifts power demand to the daytime, potentially creating new peaks in consumption. MW-scale chargers reduce charging times, producing high demand spikes that can be challenging for local grids. Fast chargers reinforce afternoon peaks, potentially overtaking the typical evening peak from residential consumers and passenger car charging.\n\nDifferent charging approaches also lead to different results in terms of how well they support the integration of renewables. Daytime charging can more directly support solar PV integration, as loading dock or en-route charging increases demand between midday and the afternoon, when solar PV production is high, and electricity prices are potentially low. Increasing daytime power demand via charging could facilitate balancing supply and demand at the system level, and reduce the need for measures such as curtailment to manage excesses in solar PV output. Daytime charging can also be directly coupled with solar through the installation of solar panels on the roofs of charging depots. In contrast, while overnight charging at truck depots may (at times) coincide with high wind output, and could potentially benefit users if electricity prices are low at night, it does not directly contribute to solar PV integration. \n\nImpact of different electric truck charging cases on total daily electricity load and net load in China, the European Union and the United States in the Announced Pledges Scenario, 2035 \n\nFast daytime charging of electric heavy-duty trucks could reduce the need for electricity system flexibility35 in the early evening - typically the most challenging period of the day in terms of power system operation. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 476, "text": "In the early evening, demand from several end uses tends to increase quickly, precisely when solar PV supply declines at sunset. As a result, the net load (i.e. total demand minus generation from solar PV and wind) ramps up, requiring higher short-duration flexibility - a need that will become all the more important as the share of solar PV increases in the overall system. This flexibility can be met by several sources, including dispatchable generation units, storage, or demand response. Additional flexibility needs can lead to operational challenges and higher costs, as maintaining a precise balance of electricity supply and demand requires either the use of power plants that have ramp-up constraints and start-up costs, or other measures that each have their own limitations (such as the state of charge of energy storage) and costs. \n\nAverage early-evening electricity system flexibility needs relative to a case of \n\nAverage electric truck charging contribution to early-evening electricity peak load by region and charging case in selected regions in the Announced Pledges Scenario, 2035 \n\nMW-scale truck charging could lead to notable hikes in the utilisation rates of local grids Drawing from these case studies of HDV charging patterns, grid simulation techniques can be used to examine the possible impacts on the grid, considering the time and location of various loads and generation units. The impacts on local grids will vary greatly depending on the particularities of each system. However, our analysis, based on a simulated local high-voltage grid, suggests that greater use of daytime fast charging for heavy trucks can result in significantly higher utilisation rates of power lines. This highlights the need for anticipatory grid investment planning, and for consideration of available grid-hosting capacities to deploy and operate HDV charging stations without putting security and affordability at risk. In our analysis, fast daytime charging, particularly MW-scale charging, would be the main driver of investments in the grid (although overnight charging may also necessitate grid upgrades). With higher shares of EVs in the fleet, fast daytime charging can induce much higher average system-utilisation rates of power lines, which suggests that targeted improvements may be needed. Our analysis shows that, at electric truck stock shares of 50%, average line utilisation can increase by up to 5 percentage points in the mid- to late-afternoon (13% with 90% electric truck stock), compared to a case without any electric truck charging. At lower EV stock shares, impacts seen in the networks could be more local. However, higher average system-utilisation rates point to a growing, systemic need for anticipatory investments in either grid expansion or upgrade, non-wire alternatives such as demand management or stationary batteries, or a combination of measures. \n\nMoreover, high utilisation rates could threaten electricity security if there is not enough spare capacity in the grid in the case of an unexpected failure. \n\nSmart charging will be an essential tool for managing the impacts of charging on the electricity grid. Not only can it help with co-ordinating supply and demand at the system level, but it can also help send adequate locational signals that ensure that local constraints are respected, and that charging takes place during the best moments for the system. In the specific case of HDVs, smart charging schemes at overnight depots can help ensure that the flexibility opportunity provided by the long charging window can be exploited as much as possible. Similarly, smart charging can incentivise drivers at loading docks or en-route chargers to either maximise or minimise their use of the charger, leaving space to complete the charge later at the depot if needed. Several other measures can reduce the impacts of fast charging, and even provide additional grid services. While grid upgrades will be necessary in many cases, other solutions such as electric road systems can be of great help. Measures such as battery swapping can also reduce strain on grids by charging replacement batteries over longer timeframes, reducing the peak power needs. Alternatively, co-located stationary batteries and/or renewable generators can enable the CPO to meet some of their own charging needs. This can combine the advantages of intra-day charging using solar energy, which can be used to charge the stationary batteries, and night discharge to reduce power grid load, where trucks can be charged using the stationary batteries. Additionally, these assets could be used to provide grid services such as energy arbitrage or frequency regulation (provided that the regulatory framework supports it), which can enhance the profitability of such projects. The business cases of each of these measures must be carefully assessed to decide which solution (or set of solutions) could be cheapest for each charging station and for the system.

{"doc_id": 477, "text": "Co-ordinated, anticipatory measures will be essential to balance the bulk power system benefits of fast charging with local grid impacts This analysis highlights the need to consider multiple aspects for the smooth rollout of HDV charging infrastructure, in particular, but also all charging infrastructure in general, including:\n **Co-ordinated charging infrastructure development**: collaborative planning between stakeholders such as policy makers, utilities, system fleet managers and CPOs can optimise system development and reduce costs, particularly as fast charging could create a need for network upgrades in different segments of the grid.\n\nAs EV sales continue to increase in today's major markets in China, Europe and the United States, as well as expanding across more countries, demand for EV \nbatteries is also set to grow quickly. In the STEPS, EV battery demand grows fourand-a-half times by 2030, and almost seven times by 2035 compared to 2023. In the APS and the NZE Scenario, demand is significantly higher, multiplied by five and seven times in 2030 and nine and twelve times in 2035, respectively. To put this in context, in the APS in 2035, there could be as much EV battery demand per week as there was in the entire year of 2019. \n\nCars remain the primary driver of EV battery demand, accounting for about 75% in the APS in 2035, albeit down from 90% in 2023, as battery demand from other EVs grows very quickly. In the STEPS, battery demand for EVs other than cars jumps eightfold by 2030 and fifteen-fold by 2035. In the APS, these numbers reach tenfold by 2030 and more than twenty-fold by 2035. Battery requirements differ across modes, with a 2/3W requiring a battery about 20 times smaller than a BEV, while buses and trucks require batteries that are between 2 and 5 times bigger than for a BEV. This also affects trends in different regions, given that 2/3Ws are significantly more important in emerging economies than in developed economies.\n\nAs EVs increasingly reach new markets, battery demand outside of today's major markets is set to increase. In the STEPS, China, Europe and the United States account for just under 85% of the market in 2030 and just over 80% in 2035, down from 90% today. In the APS, nearly 25% of battery demand is outside today's major markets in 2030, particularly as a result of greater demand in India, Southeast Asia, South America, Mexico and Japan. In the APS in 2035, this share increases to 30%. Stationary storage will also increase battery demand, accounting for about 400 GWh in STEPS and 500 GWh in APS in 2030, which is about 12% of EV \nbattery demand in the same year in both the STEPS and the APS.\n\nBattery demand for electric vehicles by mode and region, 2023-2035\n\nBattery production has been ramping up quickly in the past few years to keep pace with increasing demand. In 2023, battery manufacturing reached 2.5 TWh, adding 780 GWh of capacity relative to 2022. The capacity added in 2023 was over 25% higher than in 2022. \n\nLooking forward, investors and carmakers have been fleshing out ambitious plans for manufacturing expansion, confident that demand for EV and stationary batteries will continue to grow as a result of increasing electrification and power grid decarbonisation. Global battery manufacturing capacity by 2030, if announcements are completed in full and on time, could exceed 9 TWh by 2030, of which about 70% is already operational or otherwise committed. When assuming a maximum utilisation rate of 85%, this translates to the potential for almost 8 TWh of batteries to be produced in 2030, of which over 5.5 TWh is from plants already operational today and those with committed announcements. This level of production would be sufficient to meet global deployment needs in the APS and over 90% of the deployment needs in the NZE Scenario by 2030. Most of the announced manufacturing capacity remains concentrated geographically in today's major EV markets. Of course, as EVs and stationary storage reach global markets and battery demand diversifies, new opportunities will be created around the world to produce batteries near demand centres. \n\nHowever, today's front-runners, which have thus far dominated the supply of batteries to EV makers in China, the European Union and the United States, are still expected to play a critical role in the coming decade.

{"doc_id": 478, "text": "In China, the total committed battery manufacturing capacity is over two times greater than domestic demand in the APS by 2030, opening opportunities for export of both batteries and EVs with batteries made in China, but also increasing financial risks and reducing margins of battery producers. Notably, in both the United States and European Union, battery manufacturing capacity that is already operational or otherwise committed is almost or already sufficient to meet projected battery demand in the APS by 2030. Companies operating in these regions will, however, need to scale up production rapidly and demonstrate that they are cost-competitive in order to satisfy all or a large share of their domestic demand. \n\nAbout 70% of the 2030 projected battery manufacturing capacity worldwide is already operational or committed, that is, projects have reached a final investment decision and are starting or begun construction, though announcements vary across regions. This encouraging signal from the battery industry indicates that it is ready to produce the batteries needed to achieve road transport electrification and stationary storage targets in full. Over 40% of announced manufacturing capacity in China relies on the expansion of current plants, indicating the strengthening of industrial actors that are already part of the Chinese market. \n\nElsewhere, 80% of announced US and EU manufacturing capacity is expected to come from new plants, with a significant number of new actors entering those markets in the coming years. \n\nThe announced manufacturing capacity outside of China, the European Union and the United States, of which 85% is already committed, together with today's capacity, can meet almost half of APS needs in 2030 in these other regions. \n\nAlmost all the committed manufacturing capacity is divided among other European countries and Canada (about 35% each), India (12%), other Southeast Asian countries (8%), particularly Viet Nam, Malaysia and Singapore, and Japan and Korea (5%). Korea and Japan, however, also account for over 80% of today's capacity in these regions.\n\nThere is significant space for growth in South American countries, which today have no significant announced battery manufacturing capacity by 2030, and in countries with manufacturing capacity that falls short of their pledges, such as India, whose announced capacity would cover only a quarter of its demand in the APS.

{"doc_id": 479, "text": "The main sources of supply for battery recycling plants in 2030 will be EV battery production scrap, accounting for half of supply, and retired EV batteries, accounting for about 20%. Of course, scrap materials remain in an almost pristine state, and therefore are much easier and cheaper to recycle and feed back into the manufacturing plant. While the supply of both battery scrap and retired EVs will increase, current expansion plans and outlooks suggest that battery recycling capacity could be in significant overcapacity in 2030: total supply in 2030 could account for only one-third of the announced recycling capacity in the STEPS and APS. In the short term, overcapacity could also have important financial implications for the business models of recycling companies unable to secure stable sources of end-of-life batteries, resulting in significant consolidation of the market. However, the outlook could still change depending on whether announcements translate into final investment decisions (FIDs), and it is important to note that a rapid growth in retired EV batteries is expected starting from the second half of the 2030s. In Europe and the United States, in particular, EV \nmarkets are large, but battery recycling businesses are only just emerging and in need of further investment. \n\nCurrent and announced global battery recycling capacity and potential supply of endof-life batteries according to existing and announced policies, 2023-2030\n\nNotes: EV = electric vehicle. \"Micromobility\" refers to batteries contained in electric bikes or small electric scooters. \"Stationary storage\" includes uninterruptible power supply batteries, which are assumed to have a shorter life than EV batteries due to more frequent utilisation.

A maximum utilisation factor of 85%, an average cell energy density of 180 Wh/kg, and a battery manufacturing scrappage rate ranging from 10% (2023) to 6% (2030) are assumed. Supply of retired batteries for stationary storage, portable electronics, and micromobility refers to data provided by Circular Energy Storage. Battery production and EV retirements are based on the Announced Policy Scenario (APS). \n\nSources: IEA analysis based on data from Circular Energy Storage. \n\nPolicy also has an important role to play, such as for traceability, quality, safety, and sustainability of recycling practices. In China, for example, a new regulation announced in December 2023 will assign responsibility for EV battery traceability and recycling to EV manufacturers and to battery manufacturers for battery-as-aservice applications, with the view to bring the suppliers and consumers of endof-life EV batteries closer together. This policy move comes as supply for recyclers in China grows rapidly, and as the number of small, unofficial and unregulated recycling companies increases accordingly. This has raised concerns that they are operating without extensive battery technology expertise, environmental and safety standards, nor reliable traceability systems. \n\nStrong regulation for battery recycling already exists in some regions outside of China, especially in Europe. However, these regulations could still be made more comprehensive to solve existing challenges, notably the transport of end-of-life batteries and black mass, 36 and to improve tracking systems and safety and environmental standards. This is even more important given that the future geographical distribution of retired batteries is uncertain, and might differ from their first purchase location as a result of the EV second-hand market or other secondlife applications. \n\nThe evolution of battery chemistries and technology innovation will also have an impact on the recycling landscape of 2030. Of the two principal battery chemistries of today, nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP), \nthe former is particularly well suited for recycling because it contains greater quantities of valuable metals. In contrast, LFP batteries have a lower residual value after recycling, which could put pressure on recycling business models. \n\nNonetheless, regulations can fill this gap by either incentivising or mandating the recycling of end-of-life batteries regardless of their residual value. This is already the case for lead-acid batteries used in ICEVs, which have significantly lower residual values compared to any type of lithium-ion battery but whose recycling rate can be up to almost 100% thanks to regulation. \n\nThe lower residual value of LFP makes recycling uneconomical in Europe and the United States today, but LFP recycling is already economical in China, even though this is strongly affected by the market price for lithium. In this regard, the Chinese recycling industry is preparing to build sufficient LFP recycling capacity to meet future demand. If all announced plants are built in full and on time, capacity suited to recycle LFP is expected to be two times greater than potential supply by 2030.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}

In 2023, the global EV fleet consumed about 130 TWh of electricity - roughly the same as Norway's total electricity demand in the same year. Zooming out to the global scale, EVs accounted for about 0.5% of the world's total final electricity consumption in 2023, and around 1% in China and Europe. \n\nThe contribution of different EV segments to electricity demand varies by region. For example, in 2023 in China, electric 2/3Ws and buses combined accounted for almost 30% of EV electricity demand, while in the United States, electric cars represented over 95% of EV electricity demand. \n\nShare of electricity consumption from electric vehicles relative to final electricity consumption by region and scenario, 2023 and 2035 China remains the largest consumer of electricity for EVs in the STEPS, despite its share of global EV electricity demand decreasing significantly from about 45% \nin 2023 to less than 30% in 2035. In the APS, this share falls further, to just over 20% in 2035, as a result of strong EV growth in Europe, the United States and other countries. In 2035, the United States ranks first, ahead of China and Europe in terms of EV electricity demand in the APS. The size of the EV fleet becomes an important factor for power systems in both the STEPS and APS, with implications for peak power demand, transmission, and distribution capacity. As the fleet grows, careful planning of electricity infrastructure, peak load management and smart charging should be priorities for near-term decision-making. Effective management of fast charging, in particular, will be needed to allow for optimal planning and resilience of power systems and to mitigate peak power demand. In both the STEPS and APS, over 80% of the electricity demand for electric LDVs in 2035 is met with slow chargers. \n\nTo support policy-making and help countries prioritise charging strategies according to the size of their EV fleet and power system configuration, the IEA has developed a guiding framework and online tool for EV grid integration.\n\nGrowing EV stocks reduce the need for oil. Globally, the projected EV fleet displaces 6 million barrels per day (mb/d) of diesel and gasoline in 2030, a sixfold increase on displacement in 2023. By 2035, even less oil is needed for road transport, with displacement reaching 11 mb/d in the STEPS and 12 mb/d in the APS. In fact, we expect global demand for oil-based road transport fuels to peak around 2025. \n\nDisplacement is largely attributed to electric LDVs, followed by trucks, buses and 2/3Ws.37 In particular, it will be important to closely track the uptake of electric 2/3Ws and their role in oil displacement: electric 2/3Ws may displace active modes of travel such as walking or cycling, rather than just fossil-powered transport, which is the assumption underpinning the STEPS and APS. This highlights that while EVs are an important component of transport decarbonisation, they are far from being the only one. \n\nOil displacement by region and mode in the Stated Policies, Announced Pledges and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenarios, 2023-2035 IEA. CC BY 4.0.\n\nNotes: STEPS = Stated Policy Scenario; APS = Announced Pledges Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario; RoW = Rest of the world; LDV = light-duty vehicle. Oil displacement is based on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle fuel consumption to cover the same mileage as the EV fleet. Oil displacement is calculated by assuming that the distance \n(total kilometres) travelled by EVs by segment each year would have been otherwise travelled by ICE vehicles or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). In the case of PHEVs - where the powertrain uses both oil-based fuel and electricity, only the distance covered by electricity is included. This method of estimation assumes that EVs replace ICE or hybrid vehicles of the same segment, and that these vehicles follow the same driving behaviour. The accuracy of this assumption is uncertain. \n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that EVs are driven further than their ICE counterparts, for example.\n\nFossil fuel excise taxes can represent a major source of income for governments, and they are often used to fund road infrastructure. The shift to EVs may significantly reduce revenues under current schemes, as additional revenue from electricity taxes tends to be insufficient to cover the loss. Indeed, the rates of taxation per kilometre driven by EVs are lower than for their fossil fuel equivalents. ", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 481, "text": "In 2023, EVs displaced almost USD 12 billion in gasoline and diesel tax revenues globally. Meanwhile, the use of EVs generated close to USD 2 billion in electricity tax revenue, resulting in a net loss of USD 10 billion. As the stock of EVs (including 2/3Ws) is projected to grow globally to 460 million by 2030 in the STEPS and nearly 500 million in the APS, net tax revenue losses are set to increase by more than 5 times in the STEPS and APS. By 2035, net tax loss reaches USD 105 billion in the STEPS and USD 110 billion in the APS, doubling from 2030 levels as road transport electrification accelerates.\n\nNet tax implications of electric vehicle adoption by region **in the Stated Policies and** ![151_image_0.png](151_image_0.png)\n\nAlthough China leads global EV stock uptake, 60% of current revenue losses are in Europe, because the taxes for gasoline and diesel are far greater. For example, the gasoline tax rate in France, Germany, and Italy is more than six times that in China. In Europe, fuel tax revenue drops by nearly USD 70 billion by 2035 in the STEPS. In China, tax revenue losses reach USD 17 billion, and they remain under USD 300 million in the United States due to low federal taxation of gasoline and diesel (though greater impacts could be seen at the state level). \n\nHowever, for oil-importing countries, lost tax revenues could be balanced by reduced fuel import costs. For example, a 2020 study estimated that a total shift from ICE to electric 2Ws in Rwanda could reduce government revenue from fuel taxes by RWF 6.1 billion (Rwandan francs), but would save around RWF 23 billion \n(around USD 25 million) on fuel imports. \n\nLonger-term measures to stabilise tax revenues will be needed in the transition to electromobility. Policy strategies could involve more wide-ranging tax reforms, such as coupling high taxes on carbon-intensive fuels with distance-based charges. For example, Israel recently approved a new usage tax on kilometres travelled, which will apply to EVs as a way to compensate for lost revenues from excise duty on gasoline and diesel. Road tolls could charge users of road infrastructure. When used in city areas, tolls could also reduce traffic congestion, noise pollution and road infrastructure damage, while encouraging the uptake of alternative modes such as public transport, walking and cycling. Further, the EV transition can also bring monetary benefits due to health improvements associated with reductions in air pollution, for example by reducing health expenditures, preventing premature deaths and avoiding workdays lost due to illness. A study of the benefits of electric cars in Shanghai estimated that benefits exceed USD 6 000 per EV when replacing an average Chinese ICEV. \n\nAbout 40% of this monetary benefit is attributed to health benefits, and the remainder to climate benefits. \n\nRoad transport electrification at the global scale is expected to unlock substantial emission reductions in the coming decades. While it will be important to keep in check any additional emissions coming from electricity generation for EVs, these emissions will be more than outweighed by the emissions reductions resulting from a switch to electric. In the STEPS, the emissions avoided by using EVs rather than ICE equivalents (alongside continued improvements to ICE fuel economy) \nreach over 2 Gt of CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) in 2035. Additional emissions from electricity generation for EVs are far smaller, at over 380 Mt CO2-eq, meaning there is a net saving of 1.8 Gt CO2-eq in 2035 in the STEPS. Sustained decarbonisation of power generation helps deliver even more emission reductions in the APS, in which net emissions avoided by switching to electric reach around 2 Gt CO2-eq in 2035.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 482, "text": "However, there remains a substantial ambition gap between announced pledges and what would be required to put the world on a path consistent with the NZE \nScenario. This is especially true in the near term: in 2030, 40% more emissions are avoided in the NZE Scenario compared to the APS, in which only around 5% \nmore emissions are avoided than in the STEPS. By 2035, the gap between the NZE Scenario and APS emissions savings narrows to less than a 35% difference. At the same time, the APS net emissions reductions increase to over 10% relative to the STEPS. Current policies are not aligned with a net zero by 2050 pathway, and nor are announced pledges, calling for greater ambition in policy and corporate decision-making. Chinese passenger LDVs alone accounted for about 35% of global road transport avoided emissions in 2023, an important reminder of the benefits of switching to electric sooner rather than later to unlock greater cumulative CO2 benefits. As other segments and regions catch up, this share falls to 25% in 2035 in the STEPS. By 2035, trucks account for almost 15% of avoided emissions globally, and buses nearly 5%. Early adoption of electric 2/3Ws meant that they accounted for almost 10% of avoided emissions in 2023. While this share falls to 5% by 2035, electric 2/3Ws are providing substantial cumulative emissions savings in the interim. \n\nThe prospect of retail price parity between electric and ICE cars in some regions and segments by 2030 (see section on Electric car availability and affordability), combined with stronger policy support for electrification of cars than for other vehicle segments, means that the LDV segment is more closely aligned with the NZE Scenario than other segments. In the STEPS and APS, the LDV segment achieves more than 80% of the net avoided emissions by 2035 seen in the NZE Scenario. In contrast, buses are the least aligned with the NZE Scenario, with the STEPS accounting for 20% and the APS only 30% of the emission reductions in the NZE Scenario. For trucks, the STEPS achieves almost half of the net avoided emissions seen in the NZE Scenario in 2035, while the APS delivers almost 70%\n- a reflection of strong policies in the United States and European Union and pledges across a wider variety of countries. \n\nToday, there are already substantial emissions benefits to switching to EVs when emissions are considered on a lifecycle basis, which includes the emissions associated with the production of the vehicle as well as the well-to-wheel emissions (i.e. well-to-tank and tank-to-wheel emissions). In both the STEPS and APS these benefits increase over time as the electricity mix is decarbonised further.", "filename": "GlobalEVOutlook2024.md"}
{"doc_id": 483, "text": "Globally, in the STEPS, the lifecycle emissions of a medium-size battery electric car are about half of those of an equivalent ICEV that is running on oil-based fuels, more than 40% lower than for an equivalent HEV, and about 30% lower than for a PHEV over 15 years of operation, or around 200 000 km. These emissions savings increase by around 5 percentage points in the APS, as the grid decarbonises more quickly than in the STEPS. When comparing vehicles purchased in 2035, an ICE car produces almost two-and-a-half times the emissions of a battery electric car in the STEPS, and over three times as many in the APS, over the vehicle lifetime. For a medium-sized car, this equates to 38 t CO2-eq over the ICE car lifetime compared to 15 t CO2-eq for a BEV.38 Power grid decarbonisation around the world is crucial for maximising the environmental benefit of BEVs. In terms of global averages for medium-size vehicles sold in 2023, well-to-tank emissions decrease by 25% to 35% thanks to electricity emissions intensity improvements foreseen in the STEPS and APS. For vehicles purchased in 2035, well-to-tank emissions decrease by 55% (in the STEPS) and 75% (APS) thanks to grid decarbonisation, as the emissions intensity of electricity generation drops 50-65% between 2023 and 2035. However, even without these improvements, BEV emissions would still be about 30% lower than those from ICEVs. Grid decarbonisation in the APS also causes emissions from battery production to fall by about 10% by 2035. Vehicle size also plays an important role in determining lifecycle emissions. Many consumers are choosing larger vehicles than previously, prompted in part by model availability. Though smaller vehicles are clearly preferable in terms of both production and operation emissions across powertrains, the greater efficiency of an electric powertrain means electrification mitigates much of the negative impact of larger vehicles. While some large ICE SUVs can emit up to 50% more emissions than a medium-sized ICE car, a large battery electric SUV emits only around 20% more than a medium-sized battery electric car over its lifetime. Choosing a battery electric SUV over an ICE vehicle represents a lifecycle emission saving of about 60%. Even compared to a medium-size ICEV, a battery electric SUV results in 40% lower lifecycle emissions. See the earlier section on model availability for more information. PHEVs purchased in 2023 produce around 30% less emissions than ICEVs over the course of their lifetime in the STEPS, while this gap reaches 35% for vehicles purchased in 2035 in the APS, thanks to further decarbonisation of electricity generation. This analysis assumes that the utility factor (share of kilometres travelled on electricity) of PHEVs is 40%.39 Greater lifecycle emissions savings can be achieved if the utility factor is higher. In fact, the rated utility factor for PHEVs with range of 60 km is around 65%.\n\nHowever, analysis from the past few years has shown that the real-world utility factor is significantly lower than the official values from vehicle type approvals \n(such as the World Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure). The European Commission published a report finding that the real-world CO2 emissions from PHEVs were on average 3.5 times higher than the laboratory values. A main factor behind this discrepancy is that PHEVs are not charged and driven in full electric mode as frequently as assumed. A separate study has suggested that the realworld utility factor is lower for company cars compared to privately owned cars, because those vehicles tend to be charged less frequently. Increasing PHEV \ncharging and the use of the battery mode would result in greater reductions in emissions, but such measures are difficult to enforce.\n\nComparison of global average medium-car lifecycle emissions by powertrain in the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges Scenarios, 2023-2035\n\nIEA.

Sources: IEA analysis based on the Global Energy and Climate Model, IFP, GREET, EV Volumes, Dai et al., Degen et al., \nFrith et al.. \n\nRegionally, the lifecycle emissions benefits of BEVs vary, depending in particular on the local grid emissions intensity, average annual driving distance, and fuel economy of ICEVs. The potential for emissions savings from BEVs is relatively high in the United States, thanks to the high annual mileage of cars and projected rapid power grid decarbonisation. The emissions intensity of the US average grid mix falls by 70% by 2035 in the STEPS. As a result, the lifecycle emissions of a BEV purchased in the United States today are around 45%, 60%, and 65% lower than those of a PHEV, HEV and ICEV. Compared to the ICEV, this amounts to a net lifetime savings almost 50 t CO2-eq for a medium-sized BEV. In the United Kingdom, annual mileage is lower than in the United States - and closer to the global average - and, as a result, the lifetime emissions savings for a battery electric car compared to an ICE car amount to less than 20 t CO2-eq per vehicle. The average annual mileage in India is broadly similar to the United Kingdom, but the emissions intensity of power generation is higher, given a high use of coal. As result, BEV lifecycle emissions are similar to PHEV and HEV (<10% difference), and just 20% lower than ICEV. Thus, a battery electric car in India saves less than 10 tonnes of CO2-eq over its lifetime compared to an ICE medium-sized car. However, it is worth noting that there are significant efforts to decarbonise electricity generation in the country: the emissions intensity of the grid falls to 60% of today's level by 2035 in the STEPS. The environmental benefit of road electrification in India will therefore increase rapidly in the next years. Even today, electrification can already offer important public health advantages by decreasing air pollution in India's mega cities, like Mumbai. In China, BEV emissions are about 20%, 30%, and 40% lower compared to PHEV, \nHEV and ICEV, respectively, equivalent to almost 5 tonnes of CO2-eq (compared to a PHEV) and up to 10 (compared to an ICEV) for a medium-sized vehicle. \n\nDespite the emissions benefits of BEVs being lower in China than in Europe and the United States, its larger battery electric car fleet - over 16 million vehicles compared to over 6.5 million in Europe and around 3.5 million in the United States - makes China the leading country for GHG emissions saved through road electrification.\n\nLifecycle emissions of a medium-sized car by powertrain relative to a gasoline internal \n\nIEA.

{"doc_id": 485, "text": "The importance of vehicle lifecycle emissions is being increasingly recognised in the policy sphere. The EU battery regulation requires a battery passport that includes the battery carbon emissions and, in 2023, France announced new eligibility rules for EV subsidies. These set a cap on the carbon intensity of vehicle production to promote vehicles with lower emissions across their full lifecycle, and include the calculation methodology. Elsewhere, the Brazilian government has issued a provisional measure to establish a programme that would set minimum recycling requirements in vehicle manufacturing and reduce taxes for companies with lower pollution and emissions levels. The EU HDV CO2 standards include a review clause to evaluate the possibility of developing a common methodology for the assessment and reporting of the full lifecycle CO2 emissions of new HDVs. \n\nBattery chemistry plays an important role in defining the lifecycle emissions of EV batteries. In order to decarbonise battery manufacturing, policy ambition and concerted action to define common LCA methodologies and improve transparency will be required across the entire battery supply chain. Initiatives like the battery passport are particularly important towards this aim. \n\nOf the two main chemistries currently used, high-nickel NMC and LFP, the emissions per kWh of LFP batteries are about one-third lower than NMC batteries at the pack level. In the context of carbon tariffs, or eligibility rules for EV subsidies based on lifecycle emissions, EV and battery producers might therefore be incentivised to rely more on LFP batteries, which today are almost exclusively produced in China, rather than the more emissions-intensive NMC batteries. \n\nThe main source of emissions across the battery lifecycle depends on the chemistry. Critical minerals processing accounts for 55% of total emissions for NMC, compared to 35% for LFP. Battery manufacturing accounts for almost 50% \nof LFP total emissions, against 15% for NMC. The production of active material for both cathode (NMC or LFP) and anode (graphite) materials is also important, and currently accounts for about 25% of NMC and 15% of LFP emissions. Strategies to reduce emissions from high-nickel chemistries should focus on critical minerals processing, such as for nickel ores. Improving energy and process efficiency for critical minerals processing, active material production and battery manufacturing can also help, as can electrification along different steps in the supply chain, whenever possible. At the same time, as more retired EV batteries become available, replacing increasing shares of material inputs with recycled content will not only reduce emissions but also improve overall battery supply chain sustainability. In the case of LFP batteries, in particular, decarbonisation strategies should focus on reducing battery manufacturing emissions through higher efficiency and electrification, while reducing emissions associated with lithium ore processing. Using low-carbon electricity can also support the decarbonisation of battery production. Electricity-related emissions today account for about 20% and 25% of NMC and LFP total lifecycle emissions, respectively. Sourcing this electricity from lower-carbon sources 40 is therefore important, but it is not sufficient for deep battery decarbonisation, which would require higher levels of electrification compared to today's 20-25% electrification rates over the entire battery cell supply chain. Other important strategies to reduce battery-related emissions are increasing the energy density, which decreases the battery material intensity, and recycling. In the APS, battery lifecycle emissions decrease by about 35% for both NMC and LFP through 2035, thanks to 30% higher energy density at the battery pack level, decarbonisation of power grids, and 20% of the cathode active material sourced through recycling. \n\nAssumptions behind emission values used in this report Emission values for car production are for a medium-sized passenger light-duty vehicle and based on weighted global averages by production of the materials. \n\nThe battery electric vehicle (BEV) is considered to have a real-world range of 350 km with a battery capacity of 60 kWh. The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is considered to have a gasoline engine, a battery capacity of 15 kWh to enable a 60 km electric range, and a utility factor of 40%, meaning 40% of the kilometres are electrically driven.

{"doc_id": 486, "text": "For the world average, a lifetime activity of about 200 000 km over 15 years is assumed. For the regional analysis, lifetime activity of about 330 000 km, 170 000 km, 120 000 km, and 260 000 km is assumed for the United States, United Kingdom, China, and India, respectively. Calculations of lifecycle emissions account for mileage decay, assuming that highest annual mileage occurs in the first year of operation, with mileage in each subsequent year being equal to around 95% of the previous year. This means that by year 15, the car is driven for around half of the annual mileage of year 1. By taking into account mileage decay, our LCA results place more emphasis on the near term, as opposed to assuming constant mileage over the car's lifetime. Biofuel blending is not considered. Improvements in the emissions intensity of gasoline production are included, in line with those of IEA modelling in the respective scenario.\n\nFor car production, world averages related to energy inputs and emissions intensity of mining and material production are assumed. Actual vehicle production emissions would vary based on regional energy mixes associated with each supply chain step.\n\nBattery emissions are calculated using the 2023 chemistry sales-weighted average. NMC811 (lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide \n(LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2)) is used as a representative chemistry of the high-nickel class, given its larger market share today and considering that lifecycle emissions for individual battery designs within that class are similar.
