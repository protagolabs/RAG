{"29": ["The systematic review identified seven themes regarding autonomous vehicles (AVs): benefits, user attitudes, perceptions, and behavior; climate mitigation; legislation and regulations; sustainability; and infrastructure.", "A systematic review was conducted based on studies from 2003 to 2023 using the PRISMA approach to establish the current state of knowledge regarding the role of AVs in urban areas."]}
{"63": ["Sub-themes provide more depth to each of the seven main themes, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of AVs."]}
{"61": ["There is a social dilemma surrounding AVs as people believe in utilitarian benefits but also have personal motives to prioritize their safety."]}
{"52": ["Scholarly discourse focuses on examining the legal frameworks and sustainable practices associated with the implementation of AVs."]}
{"65": ["A significant geographic bias exists in the research, with a concentration of studies from Europe and North America. This may lead to findings not being applicable to regions with different urban transport systems and socio-economic contexts, particularly in the Global South."]}
