| ABSTRACT   |
|------------|

Emerging technologies are changing our preferences for transportation solutions, which focus on service efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Mobility as a service (MaaS) is a user-oriented transportation solution that integrates both public and private operators into the same platform. The implementation of MaaS aims to simplify users' booking procedures and increase the usability of various kinds of transportation resources. 

However, the integration of a myriad of transportation subsystems raises interpretation challenges from associated multi-stakeholder and subsystems. To overcome these challenges, the authors have involved different stakeholders from related subsystems to reveal concerns. This study aims to analyse a novel public transportation system - the self-driving mini-bus service in Shenzhen. The result shows that system characteristics and stakeholder concerns can be established using an Action, Factor and Goal structure. Stakeholders involved described their perceptions of self-driving bus integration in MaaS. The description could be used by analysts to uncover integration gaps further and could be updated by involving more stakeholders according to project developments. This study highlights the complexity of self-driving mini-buses integration challenges in MaaS from a stakeholder perspective, which provides learnings to advance the MaaS adoption in the future. 

## 1. **Introduction**

Mobility as a service (MaaS) is a comprehensive service package for fulfilling travellers' needs by both public and private mobility operators through a unified platform (Hensher, 2017; Viswanath & Mathew, 2014). MaaS is the evolution of 'as a service' 1 transportation solutions, which are expected to bring a wide range of social and economic benefits through personalised mobility (Datson, 2016). Since 2014, the idea of MaaS has received much attention from companies and authorities in providing integrated mobility services (Frank, 2018). Several ongoing projects in EU are furthering the MaaS concept and the self-driving bus service separately (KPMG, 2017; Smith, Sochor, & Karlsson, 2018 a; Smith, Sochor, & Sarasini, 2018 b). For example, the MaaS Global company has already launched the Whim app for MaaS in Finland, and the UK with different transportation services (public transportation, taxi, car, bike) integrated (MaaS Global - Mobility as a Service, 2018). 

Although there are examples of MaaS, there are still challenges caused by complex engineering disciplines and organisations involved. Changes

Sebastiaan). 1 *Anything as a service* refers to the integration of tools, technologies and solutions for one service for customers over a platform, instead of customers buying services from providers separately (Rouse & Bigelow, 2017). 

Contents lists available at ScienceDirect in transportation systems can enable social transformation such as a sharing economy, environmental awareness, and personalised consumption trends (Milakis, Van Arem, & Van Wee, 2017). For example, with the development of vehicle and infrastructure technology, the Kutsuplus project could be tested on the demand-responsive bus service 
(Honabach & Sargent, 2016). Whereas the efficiency of transportation resources and usage are essential drivers for ITS and MaaS development, few studies have examined the extent to which these developments are aligned with the needs and wishes of stakeholders (Nikitas, Kougias, Alyavina, & Njoya Tchouamou, 2017). 

System-level assessments call for a new integration of methods for structuring stakeholder perspectives that have rarely been applied to the ITS and MaaS domain. Some studies focus on the technology acceptance analysis of ITS or MaaS separately. In Sweden, system thinking methods are being applied to the stakeholder perspective to analyse how MaaS and autonomous transportation systems can create value for an urban system (Karlsson, Sochor, & Stromberg, ¨ 2016). A systematic analysis from the actor perspective is necessary in order to illustrate the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.retrec.2021.101070 Received 15 March 2020; Received in revised form 2 March 2021; Accepted 8 April 2021 Available online 4 May 2021 0739-8859/© 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

complexity and solve potential conflicts (Nguyen, Mohamed, & Panuwatwanich, 2018), (Christiaanse, 2019, pp. 83–92). In the public sector, the complexity of decision making has increased because the control process relies more on multiple actors than on single actors (Dewulf, 2007). To understand gaps from different stakeholders and subsystems, the authors conducted actor analysis to learn the opportunity for small self-driving bus service integration in a MaaS solution. 

Actor analysis methods can capture an actor's views of a policy problem to help analysts and decision-makers to understand the mechanisms behind complex situations (Bijlsma, Bots, Wolters, & Hoekstra, 2011; Hermans & Cunningham, 2013) to make better decisions. The actor analysis method was also implemented in a complex technology innovation case using the electric road system as the case study to reveal different stakeholders' perceptions and challenges at the early stage 
(Wang, Hauge, & Meijer, 2019; Wang, Hauge, & Meijer, 2019). The emergence of ITS solutions and the intention to integrate MaaS also involved multi-systems and stakeholders, in which the actor analysis method is needed to sort out the complexity uncover more insights from different stakeholder perspectives. 

This paper addresses the following question: What challenges influence the self-driving mini-bus system integration in MaaS using the actor analysis approach to revealing the stakeholders' concerns? To answer these questions, the authors first summarised the characteristics of the MaaS and ITS self-driving bus system from the current literature and projects and then revised these characteristics with experts in order to compile Action, Factor and Goal (AFG) list Va, Vb1 and Vb to describe stakeholder perceptions. This study builds on the China Bus System of the Future (CBFS) project in Shenzhen. The development of a new generation urban bus system involved a combination of new vehicle technologies and infrastructures. The gaps for self-driving mini-bus systems integration in MaaS are analysed combined with stakeholder's perspective. This study also discusses the potential future directions and the acceptance of the combination of a self-driving mini-bus system and the MaaS service. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the methodology and related research work in MaaS and ITS self-driving mini-buses cases. Section 3 introduces MaaS state-of-art, system characteristics and AFG list Va. Section 4 introduces self-driving mini-buses state-of-art, system characteristics and AFG list Vb1. Section 5 illustrates and discusses gaps for the adoption of self-driving buses in MaaS. Section 6 concludes the paper with future directions. 

## 2. **Methodology And Related Work** 2

In order to understand the integration gaps based on the different stakeholders' perceptions using interviews, actor analysis methods were selected in this study to uncover the integration gaps from stakeholders' perspectives for self-driving bus system integration in MaaS. The selection of the methods considers the availability of existing resources, the multi-stakeholder and subsystems characteristics of studied cases, and the possibility of involving different stakeholders. Actor analysis methods are applied in the policy analysis domain to help analysts having insight views in the multi-actor complex policy-making process 
(Hermans & Thissen, 2009). Actor analysis provides the chance to understand different stakeholders' perceptions, especially in complex systems. To be specific, actor analysis methods could help uncover the concerns of different actors and collect relevant knowledge from a multi-actor base. Bots (Bots, 2008) developed the dynamic actor network analysis (DANA), which provides the analyst with competitive insights into multi-actor opinions about complex policy problems. The causal map structure of DANA method can be translated to formal semantic definitions, which allow inference of intuitive meaning (Bots, 2009). This method had been implemented in water resource management problems to help experts gain a holistic view of the issues and make considered decisions (Hermans, 2005). 

Few preparations are needed before conducting actor analysis methods: understand what outcomes that are expected and what information the analysis needs. Strauss and Corbin described the research process of emerging theory from systematically inductive data collection through open coding data collection, axial coding, and selective coding, instead of placing concepts and speculation at the beginning of research as grounded theory (Wuetherick, 2010). In this study, the authors created a novel system-level AFG (Action, Factor and Goal) checklist Va 
(MaaS checklist) and Vb1 (ITS checklist) through desk research and expert reviews in order to collect key stakeholders' perspective through face-to-face interviews. The AFG list is a system-level summary list that provides stakeholders with inspiration and selections to describe their perceptions in a causal diagram during interviews. Two steps were conducted to reach the AFG list, as shown in Fig. 1. The first step was to classify subsystems and summarise MaaS characteristics and ITS conceptions from the desk research. The system characteristics were summarised into the first version of lists (Va and Vb1) and then revised by experts from the related fields. After these two steps, the list was revised and used in interviews with stakeholders in order to uncover the potential challenges of adopting self-driving buses in MaaS. The ITS AFG 
checklist Vb was used in stakeholder interviews to describe their concern, how they reacted, and the goals they wanted to achieve when a self-driving min-bus service is implemented in MaaS in the future. The analysis process is shown in Fig. 1 below. 

In the following section, the literature review was conducted focuses on MaaS topics and the self-driving mini-bus studies in published journal articles, conference proceedings, book chapters, and reports using the 
"snowballing technique" until repeated literature appears. Since MaaS is a newly emerging concept for which there is limited published scientific literature, the authors combined rigorous and non-rigorous search engines to include the relevant literature. The rigorous search engines for published scientific literature are Web of Science core and ACM digital library. Google Scholar was also used to add related grey literature 
(Haddaway, Collins, Coughlin, & Kirk, 2015) in order to provide a complete picture of MaaS and ITS, taking into account the emergence of the technology. The authors chose search results by reading the titles and abstracts and then selected the literature for MaaS and stakeholder topics in order to summarise the system characteristics in the next section. The searching details are listed in Table 1 below. The composition of stakeholder groups and subsystems depends on the development stage and specific scenarios of MaaS projects. More details of potential stakeholder groups and subsystems are discussed in Section 3.2. 

Transportation systems require a multidisciplinary approach to solve the challenges of its relations to the complexity of the sectionociety it enables (Sarasini, Marcus, Karlsson, Stromberg, ¨ & Friman, 2016). 

Spickermann et al. (Spickermann, Grienitz, & Von Der Gracht, 2014) 
discussed the complexity of urban mobility systems that require more organisations to fulfil all stakeholder needs. Wong et al. (Wong, Hensher, & Mulley, 2017) proposed an efficiency framework and situated current transportation options in order to assess their efficiency and convenience from a spatial and temporal perspective. Wong et al. also suggested MaaS could be an integrative alternative to bringing together temporal effectiveness and spatial efficiency. Stakeholders are derived from both users of social systems and from the numerous organisations involved in producing and regulating transportation. An analysis from a stakeholder perspective will help researchers uncover the internal relationships in different organisations (Fru et al., 2009). What's more, the societal evolutions will depend on stakeholders' acceptance of the on-demand autonomous mobility (Distler et al., 2018). The identification of stakeholders in organisations is critical in a multisystem project, which also links to the alignment of subsystems. A system engineering approach that focuses on the dynamic management of coherent elements in interdisciplinary complex systems can also be applied to the study of a MaaS project (Moser, 2014). 

Qualitative approaches provide powerful tools for understanding the complexities of the transportation system and travel behaviours. Expert interviews are a standard method used in social research. Talking to

crystallisation experts in the exploratory project phase is a more efficient way of gathering data than sending surveys and participatory observation (Bogner, Littig, & Menz, 2009). Moradi and Vagnoni (Moradi & 
Vagnoni, 2018) interviewed 11 stakeholders to discuss the regimes and dynamics of future mobility. Sochor et al. (Sochor, Stromberg, ¨ & 
MariAnne Karlsson, 2015) discussed the incentives for users to adopt new mobility services using participant questionnaires, interviews, and travel diaries. Miramontes et al. (Miramontes et al., 2017) conducted only surveys to learn users' behaviour for multimodal mobility services in Germany. Smith et al. (Smith, Sochor, & Karlsson, 2019) used participatory observations in meetings conducted by the public transport organisation in Western Sweden and identified seven aspects that are potentially important to the procurement of MaaS. They considered it was still too early for MaaS services to go for public procurement. 

Sarasini conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with car-sharing organisations and initiatives in four Nordic countries in order to analyse the business models for sustainable forms of car sharing in the Nordic region. He also examined MaaS business models that could generate lasting value that extends beyond the 'profit norm' (Sarasini, Sochor, & Arby, 2017; Sarasini & Langeland, 2015). Karlsson et al. (Karlsson et al., 
2016) used questionnaires and interviews based on UBiGo participants and identified the key attributes of MaaS, including a concept called 
"transportation smorgasbord". The success of MaaS business modelling raises the requirements for 'customer-oriented', multi-stakeholder collaborations between the public and private sectors, which rarely exist in the traditional transport sector (Sarasini et al., 2016). 

MaaS is intended to contribute to more sustainable transportation of people using integrated multimodal mobility services. Shared mobility services bring more innovative solutions for users, particularly in combination with public transport, to enable various modes of transport to serve as a substitute for private vehicles (Kamargianni, Li, Matyas, & 
Sch¨afer, 2016). Nowadays, the isolated all-purpose commute with a personal car and easier access to mobility service showing the sign of car ownership decreasing (Liyanage et al., 2019). The adoption of MaaS could lead to a reduction in car ownership and fits a trend in which younger city dwellers no longer want to own a car (Nikitas et al., 2017). Kamargianni et al. (Kamargianni et al., 2016) stated that a higher integration level of mobility is more appealing to travellers and will potentially shift the demand away from private vehicles to public transport. The direct mobility services consumption instead of having car ownership also leads to behavioural changes, after which the fixed costs will be reduced or disappear (Arby, 2016). Utriainen and Poll ¨ ¨anen (Utriainen & Poll ¨ ¨anen, 2018) discussed the role of different transport modes and services in potential MaaS. The car ownership will have significant changes from private owners to car-sharing companies, and the public transportation service needs to be more customer-centred, when MaaS solutions are implemented. Huwer (Huwer, 2004) discussed the dynamic relationship between public transportation and car-sharing and found that car-sharing could complement with public transport and provide integrated service to users. Some researchers also discussed that on-demand transportation services could bridge the gaps between public and private transportation (Inturri et al., 2019). The raising of MaaS services also brings up the discussion of how to capture values in a sustainable MaaS business model (Sarasini et al., 2017), 
(Faber et al., 2018, pp. 88–93). Hensher (Hensher, 2017) provided a think piece about the future development of a bus transport contract. He stated that a multi-modal mobility service could be appealing for contractual settings. A public transport agency could potentially contribute to MaaS by coordinating and integrating various service providers using a conceptual architecture that Ambrosino el at

focus on the potential threat of individual operators and MaaS providers and present an overlay networking architecture as a countermeasure to mitigate the problem. 

At the current stage, the implementation of self-driving bus systems is still limited due to the self-driving technology readiness, related regulations readiness, and social obstacles (Pettigrew & Cronin, 2019). A 
lot of research discuss the hardware, the planning, and Bae et al. discussed the comfortable criteria and time-optimal velocity planning for self-driving bus service (Bae et al., 2019). Besides the technological aspects, some ongoing discussions attempt to uncover the potential influence self-driving vehicles have on society. Geldmacher et al. 

(Geldmacher & Plesea, 2016) conducted the SWOT analysis of self-driving sharing vehicle future implementation from the users' perspective. Milakis et al. (Milakis et al., 2017) summarised aspects influenced by autonomous driving with ripple effects at the system level. 

Haboucha et al. (Haboucha, Ishaq, & Shiftan, 2017) analysed long-term user preferences when choosing to own or share autonomous vehicles by developing a model and collecting data from questionnaires. Self-driving vehicle adoption in a transportation system could also lead to changes in travel behaviour and habits. Nikitas et al. (Nikitas et al., 2017) provided an analysis of a selection of mobility initiatives, including autonomous vehicles, BRT, Hyperloop and MaaS, and how these new mechanisms could change travel behaviour norms. Docherty et al. (Docherty, Marsden, & Anable, 2018) discussed how essential governance should be developed to enhance public value under the new era of the 'Smart Mobility" transition. 

## 3. **Maas And Afg List Va**

In this section, the authors compared the MaaS definitions through published literature, ongoing MaaS projects to discuss the involved subsystems and potential stakeholders, as preparation to generate the AFG list Va for the stakeholder interviews. In this study, we only focus on the self-driving bus integration in the road public transportation sector of MaaS. 

## 3.1. System Characteristics Of Maas

In order to summarise the characteristics of MaaS, the authors started by comprising the definitions of MaaS in recent published literature. Even though MaaS is still in an early stage of development, there are various recent definitions that all share three keywords '*integrated,* 

mobility service and *user-centric*', as shown in Table 2 below. There are several similar definitions regarding Mobility as a Service (MaaS), Combined Mobility (CM), and Integrated Mobility Services (IMS). MaaS 
focuses on customer demand and integrated service packages, CM emphasises a combination of transportation modes (Christiaanse, 2019, pp. 

83–92), while IMS focuses on integrated information, booking, and payment services (Sochor et al., 2017). 

Mobility as a service (MaaS) is one of the solutions inspired by ITS 
technology and sharing economies, such as route planning, ridesharing, pop-up bus services, and e-hailing services (Utriainen & Poll ¨ anen, ¨
2018). MaaS solution initiates from the user perspective to integrate all kinds of transportation solutions into a service package. MaaS is unified and simplified for users so they can submit their travel requests. The integration of different transportation solutions in MaaS increases efficiency but also creates challenges regarding the cooperation of multi-layer and multi-stakeholder systems. After MaaS was first introduced in Helsinki, several MaaS solutions have been tested and implemented in different countries, as summarised below. The implementation of MaaS demo project needs to fit the local transportation situations, the stakeholders' requirements, and be lead by the local government with suitable governance solutions (Veeneman, van der Voort, Hirschhorn, Steenhuisen, & Klievink, 2018), (Hirschhorn, Paulsson, Sørensen, & Veeneman, 2019). 

In Sweden, MaaS service has been implemented by UbiGo as a result of the research project Go Smart 2012–2014, supported by the EUH2020 CiViTAS Eccentric project (In the Spotlight: MaaS in Stockholm - UITP Summit, 2018). The aim of forming the UbiGo Company was to test the business model for MaaS operators under real commercial conditions. 

During the research, 83 households in Gothenburg paid UbiGo to provide their everyday travel needs for six months (Arby, 2016). The reasons for participation in the field tests were curiosity, flexibility, economic and environmental concerns, to gain access to cars, test living without cars, and some were encouraged by family members (Karlsson et al., 2016). Researchers found that users expected to have personalised integration mobility services with more personal support services in the mobile phone (Sochor, Stromberg, ¨ & MariAnne Karlsson, 2015). The environmental friendly transportation modes should also be prioritized in order to achieve a sustainable transportation system (Sochor, Stromberg, ¨ & Karlsson, 2015 a). 

In Finland, the Ministry of Transport and Communications proposed that citizens towards using environmentally sustainable, economic and safe modes of transport, which encouraged the development of new, customer-oriented transportation services in 2009 to reform the transportation market legalization (LVM, 2009). There were two phases for improving; the first one is 'tearing down silos between transport markets,' and the second is to 'enhance the interoperable data and interface' 
(Smith et al., 2018 b). The MaaS concept was then first introduced, and MaaS Global is the first MaaS operator in the world to implement MaaS services in Finland and the UK using the Whim app. In Whim, the

traveller can select three subscriptions: Whim to go - for no commitment and no surcharges, Whim Urban - as regular travellers, or Whim Unlimited - for access to all transport services (MaaS Global - *Mobility as a* Service, 2018). 

Besides Sweden and Finland, the integrated mobility service projects were also tested in Vienna and Berlin. WienMobile is the MaaS application in Vienna, Austria. It provides travellers door-to-door mobility services using different modes of transport (public transport, bicycle, car sharing, and taxi, on foot or using a combination of these modes of transport) for their personalised journeys in one app. This service offers more convenience to travellers, and they can purchase a mobility service and also display their ticket in the app (The Mobility as a Service MaaS success story: WienMobil, 2017; Wiener Linien, 2018). In Berlin, the SiMobility project has been launched to create the mobility platform 
'Smile,' which provides users with all available transportation solutions. 

Before the project ended, there were 1000 pilot users registered who could discover the smile app and experience the future of mobility as a service. The benefits of Smile implementation are on-demand offerings increased the transportation system efficiency with also increase customer satisfaction. The SiMobility project has also been implemented in London and Abu Dhabi to test the influence on local transportation systems (SiMobility Flow - Mobility - Siemens, 2016; smile - simply mobile The future of mobility, 2018). 

Futhermore, in Asian countries such as Singapore, MaaS was tested by the joined forces of Nanyang Technological University, JCT Corporation, and SMRT Service Pte Ltd. The project testbed was on the NTU 
campus and JTC CleanTech Park, as shown in Table 1 above. In the test eScooters, bicycles and autonomous vehicles were integrated with shuttle buses and MRT networks in current transportation systems 
(Jalan Mobility, 2017; Shen, Zhang, & Zhao, 2018). China, with the vast populations, which face the challenges of high travel demand, also initiates the concept of MaaS based on the booster of sharing economy and the development of ITS technologies (KPMG, 2018). According to some researches, China will become one of the largest markets of MaaS by 2030. The reasons for the rapid growth of shared mobility adoption are: the large percentage of non-drive populations, the pay-out for vehicle ownership, and the difficulty of apply for license plates (Keeney, 2017). Although there are several mobility service companies start providing the MaaS form products, the governments need to participate more to lead the integration of multi-modal transportation solutions (Streeting, Chen, Teng, Edgar, & Koh, 2016). 

## 3.2. Potential Subsystems And Stakeholders In Maas

Potential stakeholders play a crucial role in user-centric MaaS systems. In the integration of a variety of services in MaaS, the composition of potential stakeholders is also complex and depends on the implementation scenarios. Several MaaS cases involve stakeholders discussing the challenges of implementation. Gonzalez el at (Gonzalez-Feliu et al., 2018). addressed the functional classification of stakeholders in the urban transportation system. Steven el at (Sarasini et al., 2016). 

discussed critical stakeholder groups, including mobility providers, private and public sector organisations, infrastructure providers, urban developers, and citizens, while Sochor el at (Sochor et al., 2017). discussed key stakeholders, including MaaS operators, transport service providers, researchers, and funders in Table 3 below. 

Smith el at. (Smith et al., 2018 a) explored how MaaS could be developed by interviewing 19 MaaS actors in Western Sweden. The emergence of MaaS has also resulted in changes to the transport ecosystem by bringing more stakeholders on board, as shown in Fig. 2 below. 

From the limited literature, the authors found two studies discussed the components of MaaS system. A scalable IT platform brand recognition and acceptance are crucial for the future adoption of MaaS (Callegati et al., 2017). Kamargianni et al. (Kamargianni et al., 2016) 
discussed three key components for integrated and seamless MaaS 
implementation: ticket and payment integration, mobility package service, and ICT integration. Fig. 3 shows an example of users submitting and paying for their travel requests through the MaaS app according to their needs. 

In considering the functionality of the future implementation of MaaS, combined with the discussion from the literature, as shown in Table 3, the authors summarised MaaS potential stakeholders in 6 groups, corresponding to 6 MaaS subsystems: operating group, regulatory group, energy, and environment group, technology group, road group, and social group, as shown in Fig. 4 below. The composition of each stakeholder group will depend on different implementation scenarios. In Section 4, the introduction of involved stakeholders is summarised.

## 3.3.  Maas Afg List Va Gaps. 3.4. Expert Validation Of Va List

In order to visualise potential stakeholders' concerns in the interviews, the AFG list was summarised based on the MaaS ongoing project and characteristics in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 . In order not get lost when selecting the related elements to compose the list, the AFG
list Va was generated by combining the existing literature, the six stakeholder group categories in section 3.1 to identify potential MaaS
stakeholders' actions, factors, and goals as shown in Table 4 . From the literature, we find that currently, most studies discussed the designed MaaS operation process, related variety of challenges, and preparation of MaaS testing. In this table, the columns from left to right comprise 9 action selections, 29 factor selections, 12 before project testing goals, and 6 during project testing goals. The AFG list will be revised by experts and compared with the self-driving bus AFG list, then used as a tool for stakeholders to describe their perceptions to uncover the integration To revise the MaaS Va, we conducted an online validation discussion with two MaaS experts each works more than five years in public transportation and MaaS domain: one from Finland (interviewee F) and one from China (interviewee C). The interview F is the CEO of a MaaS service company and has extensive experience in MaaS implementation and operation in several cities. Interviewee C has extensive research experience and serves as a member of an expert group in several international MaaS and public transportation research projects. These two experts are from the operation and society subsystems, as shown in Fig. 4 . In the validation discussion, the authors talked with expert F and C separately through online calls and showed the Va list and discussed if anything in the Va list should be revised.

Both interviewees stated that complex multisystem integration and the negotiation process to bring different stakeholders onboard are the biggest challenges in the start phase (GB 1-9 and GD2-3). In the initial stage, authorities and key stakeholders should take the lead and encourage discussions, training and information sharing during the project testing stage (A1-9). At the same time, related regulations, policies, and licenses (F1-4, F9) should be established. During the testing process, the technology solution will be improved (F5-8). The operational factors will also be tested and improved for better solutions (F1023). According to the experts' experience, the interest and trust of MaaS appeal to more service collaboration and involved users' selection. Also, the interviewee F emphasised the importance of the MaaS system reliability (F8) is essential and will influence potential partners' decisions. 

The information and communication technology (F6) are crucial enablers for the MaaS service implementation to integrate current taxis, car sharing, and rental services. The self-driving vehicles will bring more flexible mobility services, based on dynamic travel requests through the MaaS platform (F10, F18). At the same time, different stakeholders could learn from the mobility services demo process (F19–20, F23). The results will also strengthen the development of fully L5 self-driving vehicles in the near future. The successful implementation of MaaS is aiming to provide convenience to customers and increase the efficiency of the entire transportation system in the long-term (GB10-12 and GD1, GD4-6), there are a variety of considerations, expectations (F25) and goals from each stakeholder groups like listed in the Va list. Both interviewees agreed that MaaS is a complex and multi-layered system that needs to be analysed from the system level to get clear structures and potential challenges. The interviews conducted by researchers using the Va list can collect different stakeholders to express their opinions at the system level. This process will help to shorten the negotiation process for MaaS implementation. 

## 4. **Self-Driving Bus Systems And Afg List Vb**

In the literature, several terms are used to describe whether a vehicle can drive on its own, such as autonomous vehicles or connected and automated vehicles (Elliott, Keen, & Miao, 2019). Brenden el at (Pernestål Brenden, Kristoffersson, & Mattsson, 2017). discussed the definition of a self-driving vehicle: a road automated transport solution that can operate fully or partly with no driver on-board during the operation process. The key question is whether a car can operate without external system support. SAE International established the five-level classification of autonomous driving from L0 no automation to L1 adaptive cruise control or driver assistance, L2 partial automation for two or more primary control functions, L3 conditional automation, L4 high-level automation and L5 full automation (Greenblatt & Shaheen, 2015). The more automation level, the more technologies and systems integration will need. In this section, we will discuss the AFG list Vb by considering the needs of the CBFS L3 Self-driving mini-buses system as the starting point and discuss the future implementation of the L4 and L5 self-driving bus system. 

In a self-driving bus system, vehicles range from last-mile mini-buses 
(6–12 persons per vehicle) to artery mini-buses (10–20 passengers per vehicle). There are various self-driving bus demo cases worldwide. The Easymile company, which started with the CityMobil2 project, has now launched its EZ10 autonomous shuttle bus in 20 countries (in Europe, North America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East) to test self-driving smart mobility solutions (EasyMile, 2014). In Japan, Softbank's self-driving bus HINNO has also been tested in rural areas. China is currently engaged in several self-driving mini-buses research projects (Apollo self-driving small bus information, 2018), (Yutong L4 self-driving small bus testing in public road, 2019). The CBSF project is the first open road-testing self-driving bus that combining MaaS 
concept, which aims to achieve next-generation sustainable and self-driving mini-bus systems. 

In this section, two cases were involved in establishing the selfdriving bus AFG list Vb. The first self-driving mini-bus case is used in Section 4.1 to summarise the characteristics of self-driving mini-bus systems using stakeholder surveys. The second case CBFS project in Section 4.2 and 4.3 is used for conducting the actor analysis and involved different stakeholders in describing their concerns of selfdriving mini-bus integration with MaaS. See below for details. 

## 4.1. Self-Driving Bus System Vb1 List In Case1

A self-driving bus system, which aims to improve the operational efficiency of the existing transportation facilities, involves a wide range of traffic information and services. A self-driving bus system involves many subsystems for technology and service integration. It is a complex system with multiple stakeholder groups, including governments, transport authorities, industries, passengers, and research institutes involved. Appropriate role orientation and task-sharing collaborations are essential prerequisites for effective system development. A selfdriving bus system integrates many technical fields such as vehicle engineering, traffic engineering, information engineering, control engineering, communications technology, and computer technology. A selfdriving bus system will be supported by information and communication technology such as mobile communication, broadband networks, RFID, 
sensors, and cloud computing. Besides the technological supports, the challenges and real stakeholders' concerns rose from the testing process should also be collected and considered to overcome the gaps between technology feasible and implementation feasible. 

In order to summarise the characteristics of a self-driving mini-bus system, a survey was conducted in an adoption self-driving mini-bus project in Changzhou, China, to complement the system characteristics list from real stakeholders. This project, which was based on the selfdriving bus prototype of a British company Westfield, aimed to uncover the challenges of a wireless charging self-driving bus system in the Chinese transport environment. The questionnaires were handed out at one of the project meetings. The participants were asked what they will concern for self-driving mini-bus system implementation in the current transportation system. The workshop included 25 participants from different stakeholders shown in Fig. 4: local government (6), the local transportation authority (4), national transportation authority (3), the vehicle industry (2), public transportation service providers (2) technology and infrastructure providers (5) and research institutes (3) to be representative and comprehensive. The participants were the key stakeholders who make decisions in the project. The results of the questionnaires are summarised in the AFG structure, which is the Vb1 list, as shown in Table 5 below. 

From Table 5, we found that the action selections relate more to the promotion of self-driving solutions, staff training, and system setup at the current stage. The factor selections are focus on the policy and regulation, technology, and the operational related issues for the selfdriving system. The goal selections focus is on technology acceptance, implementation and achieving a more efficient and sustainable transportation system. This list is used in the CBFS stakeholders' interviews in the following section. 

## 4.2. Case 2: Cbfs Introduction

The CBFS project is the first commercialized L3 self-driving mini-bus system with MaaS concept in China in 2017 (Autonomous buses go on trial in Shenzhen - YouTube, 2017), which aimed at testing an autonomous bus service and increasing the attractiveness of an urban bus system. In the CBFS project, the test route is 1.5 km long with three bus stops, as shown in Fig. 5 below. The bus can avoid pedestrians, accelerate, decelerate, make emergency stops, change roads and navigate traffic lights at speeds of up to 30 km/h - and it can carry up to 19 passengers. 

Five subsystems have been defined in the future implementation of CBFS, as shown in Fig. 6 below. The passenger flow management system will receive real-time passengers' travel demand and send the mobility service request to the CBFS central control system for bus scheduling and operation. The safety management system will check the bus operation process and send a potential risk report to the central management system. The charging management system will receive the bus operation schedule and pre-charge for each bus while the maintenance system will keep monitoring the real-time operation status to increase system reliability. 

In the CBFS project testing stage, six stakeholder groups that cover

the subsystem structure, as shown in Fig. 4 are involved in the project: the national transportation authority, the technology provider company, the research institute, the bus operation company, the local transportation authority and the urban road association. The representatives of the six groups of stakeholders participated in the interviews. 

## 4.3. Stakeholder Interview And Afg List Updates

Due to the project being at demo testing stage, the face-to-face interviews were conducted with the available stakeholder representative of six groups, as shown in Table 6. During the interviews, stakeholders were providing the Vb1 list to describe their perceptions for self-driving bus adoption in the CBFS case study. Their perception of the CBFS working process and concerns is shown in Appendix 1. Some updates were made by the interviewees based on Vb1, and the revised AFG list Vb are summarised in Table 7 below. 

As shown in Table 7, several selections were eliminated (marked with crossed line), several selections were added (*in italic*), and some are modified (marked with underline) by CBFS stakeholders. The action 
'regulation study' was removed due to the involved stakeholders were

mobility system shares common concerns with the MaaS system. The technology provider also pointed out that the implementation of MaaS self-driving mini-bus service will lead to a transportation service revolution. 

From the literature, we find that the main drivers that bring in MaaS 
concept are resources utilization and user-centred service satisfaction which also shows in the summarised AFG list Va. After the implementation of actor analysis with stakeholders, the authors summarised the stakeholders' concerns in Vb. The factors in MaaS AFG list Va as shows in Table 4 starting with technology, infrastructure and regulation 
already familiar with the existing regulations and will propose updates and suggestions to improve the current regulations for self-driving bus and MaaS. A21-24 were newly added actions by national ITS research centre, local public transport operator and technology provider for more information sharing, operation planning, and the system and vehicle maintenance. In the factor selections, F14 (route planning) and F18 (vehicle maintenance) were removed and considered as the actions A22 and A24 by stakeholders. F3 (subsidy) and F6 (job opportunity) in Vb1 also didn't select by involved stakeholders due to no subsidy and unknown influence of job opportunity at the current stage. F12 (VI

related factors (F1-10). Then the factors are operational and economic concerns (F11-22). The factors from F23 to F29 are user experiencerelated factors. Table 4 has few action selections since there are insufficient studies or cases could show the real MaaS implementation process. Therefore the goal list is long due to the high expectation from different stakeholders. The goal selections are focused on the service integration, cost, business model and environment impacts. The compassion of Va and Vb shows the potential gaps of self-driving bus integration in limited MaaS practices: In Vb, there are more operation level action selections than Va due to the stakeholders who participated in the CBFS interviews encountered more detailed operational level concerns. In comparison with factor selections, Va and Vb share a similar amount which Va has 29 selections, and Vb has 27 selections. The selections in Vb relate more to vehicle and infrastructure while the selection in Va relates more to passenger behaviour and satisfaction. In the goal selection, Va has two groups of selections with GB represents the goals which stakeholders want to achieve during MaaS testing and GD are the goals which stakeholders want to achieve after MaaS testing for large-scale implementation. The GB selections also show several potential benefits that MaaS will bring to the transportation system. The GD selections focus more on the long-term in order to improve the entire transportation system and customer satisfaction. In Vb, goal list is shorter than Va with focus on the system recognitions, interoperability, efficiency and acceptance. 

In order to understand what stakeholders were most concerning, the authors listed the action, factor and goals selections which mentioned by half (3) and more than half of stakeholders, and shows the causal influence with arrows among these selections as shown in Fig. 7 below. 

The causal map can be translated into formal semantic definitions, which allow inference of intuitive meaning. The structure of the diagram follows directly from the DANA method as mentioned in Section 2. The blue arrow shows the negative causal influence while the black arrows show the positive causal influences among the AFG elements. The number on the arrows means the frequency of the causal influence mentioned by different stakeholders. Most linked action, factor and goal selections are 'promote MaaS', 'system reliability' 'safety', 'MaaS system implementation', 'technical recognition' and 'transportation system efficiency'. From the diagram, we can find, 'promote MaaS', will provide more chance for MaaS test, which increase the 'system reliability'. The mobility service 'safety' factor helps society to accept the innovation service to achieve 'MaaS implementation' and 'technical recognition' goals. In the end, 'transport system efficiency' goal will be increased with MaaS implementation, technical recognition, technology interoperability and social acceptance. More road facilities will help reduce the operation cost to increase the social acceptance. 

## 6. **Conclusions And Future Works**

The major contribution of this paper is to analyse the integration challenges of self-driving mini-bus system integration in MaaS using the actor analysis method. In this study, the AFG list was used in the interviews and analysis to illustrate the relationships between different subsystems from stakeholders' perspective. The analysis and result in this study show the process about how to collect and analysis different stakeholder's concerns in a complex system. The AFG list will be iterated according to the project stage and stakeholders' focus. This study will help potential stakeholders of a self-driving bus system to foresee the inherent challenges when a self-driving bus system is integrated with MaaS in reality. What's more, the involvement of different stakeholders also contributes to providing future modelling opportunities for selfdriving bus system implementation in MaaS using the AFG list. A 
system-level analysis will also encourage stakeholders from different groups to further communicate in order to reduce potential conflicts and accelerate the integration and acceptance of new technologies. 

The goal of combining the self-driving vehicle service and MaaS is to achieve a seamless user-centred end-to-end mobility solution to realise a sustainable and efficient transportation system. To achieve this, the dynamic on-demand supply and opened data-sharing subsystems need to integrate with existing transportation systems gradually. As more mobility services are integrated into MaaS system, more sub-systems will be required. The negotiation process and incomplete regulations among this process between different systems will be the main challenges, as reflects from CBFS stakeholders' updates in AFG selections. 

The adoption of self-driving mini-bus systems in MaaS provides a chance for travellers to use on-demand service at a lower price compared to carpooling or ridesharing solutions. The connection between selfdriving mini-bus and MaaS also been emphasised by the interviewee

F, which he stated that self-driving vehicles were one of the crucial enablers for the MaaS solution. The self-driving mini-bus is more convenient than traditional public transportation services and at the same time, help save the road space and increase service efficiency with high user satisfaction. 

From the analysis in this study, we can confirm that an understanding of system structure and stakeholder perception is essential for the encouragement of a technological innovation project implementation. Developing a self-driving mini-bus technology is an engineering problem. However, the implementation of a self-driving mimi-bus in MaaS is a more complex problem involving multiple subsystems and stakeholders. For the emerging concept system, being aware of stakeholder perceptions by applying the AFG structure could help to align the complex relationships and get ready for future self-driving mini-bus and MaaS implementation. 

As MaaS and the self-driving mini-bus system are at a very early stage, the available scientific published literature and data are limited. The composition of the AFG list will be influenced by the project stages and involved stakeholders. Several European researchers conducted the survey and interviews at the project testing stage also to learn the stakeholder expectations and current travel behaviour. In the next step, more relative key stakeholders need to be involving to extend the dataset. The enriching of the dataset both from the published literature
