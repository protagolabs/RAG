|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

As the advancement of driverless technology, together with information and communication technology moved at a fast pace, autonomous vehicles have attracted great attention from both industries and academic sectors during the past decades. It is evident that this emerging technology has great potential to improve the pedestrian safety on roads, mitigate traffic congestion, increase fuel efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

However, there is limited systematic research into the applications and public perceptions of autonomous vehicles in road transportation. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to synthesise and analyse existing research on the applications, implications, and public perceptions of autonomous vehicles in road transportation system. It is found that autonomous vehicles are the future of road transportation and that the negative perception of humans is rapidly changing towards autonomous vehicles. Moreover, to fully deploy autonomous vehicles in a road transportation system, the existing road transportation infrastructure needs significant improvement. This systematic literature review contributes to the comprehensive knowledge of autonomous vehicles and will assist transportation researchers and urban planners to understand the fundamental and conceptual framework of autonomous vehicle technologies in road transportation systems.

## 1. Introduction

Road transport system is significant in the transportation of goods and people from one place to another via the road network. The transportation of goods and people relies on the distance, weight, volume, and type of cargo, as well as the local road infrastructure. The demand for travel within an area is met by the availability of transportation services, collectively referred to as transportation systems. Analysing the relationship between road capacity and traffic volume is crucial in transportation studies. However, there have been significant issues with road transportation systems, such as traffic gridlock, road accidents, and inadequate road infrastructure, especially in a connected and automated driving environment (Alex et al., 2023; Barberi et al., 2022; Pappalardo et al., 2022).

The movement of people from one place to another is the core framework of the transportation planning and decisionmaking of urban planners in metropolitan cities. These cities primarily focus on walking, cycling (Zhang et al., 2023), and public transportation, which are starting to depend on electric vehicles and other intelligent shared mobility. These intelligent shared mobilities assists in accelerating the conversion of fuel-driven vehicles to electric vehicles and minimizes global warming and air quality failures. Urban areas have created and developed mechanisms to encourage people to use electric vehicles and not fuel-driven cars and single-passenger public taxis to achieve this aim. This is to convince people that sustainable transportation will continue in the future. Recently, metropolitan cities have invested financially in road infrastructure and intelligent transportation systems, which are necessary to assist connected multimodal transportation systems. This comprises of shared autonomous electric vehicles to replace less effective bus lines (Alonso Raposo et al., 2019). In addition, previous research carried out by transportation and logistics researchers on autonomous vehicles stated that the aim is to minimize the dangers of vehicular collision (Glaser et al., 2010), and Gelbal et al. (2020) suggested a new approach to the prevention of collision with reference to low-speed autonomous shuttles comprising of pedestrians in a real-life traffic situation in comparison to other approaches. Their objective was to focus on the immediate environment and safety of their driving environment, such as steering or braking, without any human intervention.

The importance of introducing autonomous mobilities into the transportation of goods and services cannot be underemphasized (Gonzalez-gonz  alez et al., 2019  ; Stead and Vaddadi, 2019; Ukaegbu et al., 2021b). In recent years, researchers such as Severino et al. (2021), Stead and Vaddadi
(2019) and Mattas et al. (2021) have argued that the demand for autonomous mobilities will play a significant role in mobility in urban areas and its effects on the transportation of goods and services coupled with the risks associated with this disruptive technology on road transportation. There may be a reduction in the production of carbon and travel time spent in the vehicle, which allows the driver to engage in some other things rather than driving all day. However, it is not impossible to reduce traffic congestion and vehicular accidents, which are majorly caused by excessive drinking of alcohol, drivers not adhering to traffic rules, and tiredness
(Olayode et al., 2022a). The primary objectives of autonomous vehicles are illustrated in Fig. 1.

According to the previous studies (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2015; Kockelman et al., 2016; Litman, 2017; Olayode et al., 2020a, 2020b), autonomous vehicles are supposed to reduce accidents on the road and make travelling times shorter, accident-free, reduced excessive road maintenance (Bosch et al., 2018 € ), ergonomically comfortable, and more viable (Anderson et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2014; Fagnant and Kockelman, 2014; Wadud et al., 2016) and reduce the costs associated with travelling. Autonomous vehicles can lead to a gradual reduction of the overall number of vehicles on the road depending on the real-life traffic scenario (Bosch et al., 2018 € ; Chen et al., 2016; Zachariah et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015) and significant urban road capability (Brownell, 2013; Fernandes and Nunes, 2010; Friedrich, 2015). Using autonomous technologies to

![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)

transport goods will revolutionize the logistics and supply chain industry and change the status of urban transportation to a more robust, intelligent, and innovative system. Drastically reducing the overall expenses of travel may likely lead to a significant increase in additional travel demand (Gucwa, 2014; Hills, 1996) and usher in a new wave of suburban urbanization and urban development (Glaeser and Kahn, 2004).

## 1.1. Research Gaps And Contributions

Many transportation researchers have published academic literature describing the technological advancement of autonomous vehicles and their application in road transportation (Denaro et al., 2014). However, there is a limitation in the literature review which outlines the negative disruption of autonomous vehicle technologies and the application of autonomous technologies such as autonomous vehicles in transporting goods and services. Another significant observation is that despite recent research carried out by Bansal and Kockelman (2017) and Litman (2017), in which they stated that in the next 20 years, autonomous vehicles would have been widely implemented in road transportation systems worldwide (i.e., level 4 or 5 of autonomous vehicles). However, to our best knowledge, there is no research in the academic literature that critically scrutinizes the historical concepts, applications, and technologies of autonomous vehicles.

The changes experienced by road transportation over the last two years remain unprecedented. The outbreak of COVID19 and its variants have led to a renewed interest in autonomous vehicles and the application of autonomous technologies in the transportation of people, goods, and services. This paper aims to torchlight the importance of introducing autonomous technologies in the movement of goods and services, including their advantages and disadvantages. This literature review will provide a significant opportunity to advance our understanding of autonomous vehicles and make an important contribution to the field of connected and autonomous vehicles. Also, this literature review will explain the mode of autonomous vehicles comprehensively and systematically. The research gaps are summarized as follows.

 Public perception and acceptance of autonomous vehicles.

While several studies have explored public attitudes towards autonomous vehicles, more research is needed to understand how the public views this technology, what factors influence their perception, and how to enhance public acceptability.

 Safety implications of autonomous vehicles. While there has been some research on the safety benefits of autonomous vehicles, more research is needed on the hazards and obstacles of integrating them into the road transportation system.

 Legal and regulatory issues. To deploy autonomous vehicles safely and effectively, liability, data privacy, and cybersecurity must be addressed.

 Integration with public transportation systems. To enable seamless and efficient passenger mobility, autonomous vehicles need to be integrated with public transit networks.

 Human factors. Drivers, passengers, and other road users must be studied to ensure safe and effective autonomous vehicle operation.
The contributions of this research to the field of road transportation, especially in autonomous vehicles, are in threefold.

 This research investigates the overall impact of autonomous vehicles on road transportation systems.

 This research examines the emerging role of autonomous mobility in the context of the transportation of goods and services.

 Drawing upon previous related studies, this research gives a comprehensive overview of the history and definition of autonomous vehicles, not excluding the public perceptions of different countries on using autonomous vehicles in their road transportation networks.
The overall structure of this literature review takes the form of eight sections. Section one gives a brief introduction comprising of the aim and contributions of this research.

Section two gives an overview of the recent history of autonomous vehicles, and the third section is concerned with the methodologies used for this literature review. The fourth section presents autonomous vehicle technologies, including their advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. The fifth section of this research discusses the human public perceptions of autonomous vehicle technologies. The sixth section presents the theoretical dimensions of autonomous mobilities in the transportation of goods and services, including autonomous mobility-as-a-service (MaaS). The seventh section explains in detail the impacts of autonomous vehicles in road transportation systems regarding safety, traffic congestion and travel behaviour. Finally, the conclusion summarizes the implications of the findings and future research on autonomous vehicles.

## 2. A Short History Of Autonomous Vehicles

Autonomous vehicles were firstly envisioned in the early 19th century (Pendleton et al., 2017). The US, Germany, France, and Japan had R&D programmes from 1964 through the early 2000s to develop autonomous bus and truck platoons, intelligent vehicle systems, and video-based vehicle driving scene processors (Shladover, 2018). Automotive makers like Volvo have used autonomous driving technology since 2006 and introduced a fully autonomous test car (SAE levels 1 and 2) onto the road transportation network in 2017 (Shladover, 2018). In 2009, Google and other technology companies developed an autonomous vehicle within the SAE levels 1 and 2. By late 2020, WAYMO, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., had debuted its commercial AV prototypes, which had driven over 3 million miles in four US states. Since 2014, TESLA, another tech behemoth, has built electric vehicles with driverless capacity of operating 90% of the running time without human intervention (Shladover, 2018).

Completely self-driving vehicles, such as an NHTSA-level 4 autonomous vehicle (Aldana, 2013), ensured a rudimentary advance in car mobility. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (2016), autonomous vehicles are expected to reduce road accidents and make travel times shorter and accident-free, less expensive
(Boesch et al., 2016), more comfortable, and more viable
(Kockelman et al., 2016), and substantially reduce the costs associated with travel. Children, the disabled, and the elderly will find travelling easier with AV (Anderson et al.,
2014; Chong et al., 2013; Chun and Lee, 2015; Kockelman et al., 2016). Depending on the real-life traffic condition, autonomous cars can steadily reduce the number of vehicles on the road (Bosch et al., 2018 € ) and substantial urban road capability (Brownell, 2013; Tientrakool et al., 2011). Human errors on the road will be reduced by autonomous vehicles, and this is projected to result in considerable improvements in human and vehicular safety, vehicular mobility, and road transportation sustainability (Olayode et al., 2020a).

Nowadays, road transportation is experiencing a worrisome issue regarding the implementation of an autonomous vehicles in road transportation; issues such as traffic safety and road visibility issues are emerging. These issues must be addressed before AVs become a reality (Easa et al., 2020).

Assume that all of the futuristic predictions regarding selfdriving cars come true. In that case, it will alter worldwide road transportation networks and transform urban transportation into a more robust, intelligent, and inventive system. Reduced travel expenses are likely to increase additional demand for travel (Gucwa, 2014), as well as a new wave of suburban urbanisation and urban development (Glaeser and Kahn, 2004).

Moreover, there have been some significant issues with autonomous vehicles. These issues, for example, are the autonomous vehicle's reaction time to environmental changes and low public confidence are their key issues.

Autonomous vehicles are often questioned, such as "How soon will autonomous vehicles be part of our daily lives?", "Is it reliable?", "Will it decrease traffic and road accidents?"

## 2.1. Different Levels Of Sae Automation

According to the conceptual framework of an autonomous vehicle, we have four levels of taxonomy in automated vehicles; these levels were developed in 2013 by NHTSA (Wadud et al., 2016). In 2014, a level of taxonomy in automation, as shown in Fig. 2, was developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers International (SAE). It was later upgraded in 2016
(Coppola and Morisio, 2016; Milakis et al., 2017; SAE, 2016a, b; Snyder, 2016). Later in 2016, NHTSA adopted SAE's levels of taxonomy and automation (NHTSA, 2016).

In conceptual theory, an automated vehicle system can be called an "autonomous" system if the automated system inside the vehicle can do the dynamic vehicle driving functionalities in a driving environment. Regarding the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy of the United States Department of Transportation, a vehicle is considered autonomous if it possesses levels 3e5 automated systems (Dot, 2016). The caveat about these autonomy levels is that they are not adequately maintained, and researchers have grouped all these levels of autonomy as autonomous (Shladover, 2018).

![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)

Driving a vehicle on the road requires essential functions such as localization, perception, planning, control, and management (Coppola and Morisio, 2016). Acquiring information about the immediate driving environment of an AV is significant to localization and perception. The availability of all these functions in a vehicle is what makes a vehicle autonomous. Suppose any autonomous vehicles have to communicate with various types of infrastructures to acquire information about their driving environment or negotiate their driving manoeuvres. In that case, it is referred to as a connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) (Shladover, 2018); however, when any human-driven vehicle, either manual or automated, has to communicate with different types of infrastructures to possess information, it is known as a connected vehicle (CV)
(Coppola and Morisio, 2016; Hendrickson et al., 2014).

Therefore, CV technology is complementary or synergistic to implementing autonomous vehicles to a certain degree
(Shladover, 2018), even though connectivity is not a mandatory characteristic of an autonomous vehicle
(Hendrickson et al., 2014).

## 3. Methodology 3.1. Review Design

This research utilizes a systematic literature review focussing

![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)

on understanding the applications, impacts, and public perceptions of autonomous vehicles. Fig. 3 shows the five-step approach used in this research. To achieve the aim of this research, this research was designed to give a systematic review of autonomous vehicles taking into consideration the following.

 Autonomous vehicle technology. Travel behaviour and traffic congestions.

 Understanding the capability, impact planning, and policies of autonomous vehicles.

## 3.2. Source Of Literature Reviews

The search was only conducted on peer-reviewed manuscripts. The search was conducted from January 2021 to August 2021, and we only focused on articles published in the last ten years (2011e2021). Different types of searches were carried out by combining multiple keywords. The keywords applied were grouped into two significant categories. The first parentheses used in the first group were associated with the title of the journal and conference articles, and the second group was applied to the abstract of this research. The resultant search keywords were first verified by going through the abstract and reading the full text to verify their scope against the research objectives.

This research used three academic databases (i.e., Scopus, EBSCO and Web of Science) to search articles related to
"autonomous vehicles" or "automated vehicle technology" or "driverless vehicle" or "self-driving vehicle" or "autonomous driving". These journal articles were then filtered by a criterion dependent on the inclusion and exclusion of relevant journal and conference articles to the aim and objectives of the research. According to the research by Mallett et al. (2012),
the inclusion and exclusion criteria applied for screening of data gathered are applied to achieve the aim and filter the data collected so that the valuable data will not be mixed with useless ones. The inclusion and exclusion techniques principles were created and applied to filter journal articles, select common features, and choose the most relevant articles that were gathered. A typical example is a journal article that is 15 years old and cannot be used to compare to the one published two years ago. A clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria will assist in sorting data gathered
(journal and conference articles) on a homogenous level.

Table 1 shows the inclusion and exclusion criteria applied in this research.

It is important to note that these criteria are applied in sorting journal or conference articles according to their level of relevance to the research; this is important to ensure that the journal or conference articles used are appropriate for the research. An overall of 623 research articles were gathered using the keywords when searching academic databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO. The research narrowed its search to only English-language journals and conference articles because English is a universal language that is easy to speak and understand and is well-known in the academic community. Another significant criterion adhered to during this research is that the research only focuses on peerreviewed journal or conference articles to achieve a high level of credible research contribution. The table below summarizes the process of identifying the articles that are not excluded from the research.

## 3.3. Sample And Sampling Techniques

The up-to-date search carried out on these academic databases was investigated by applying the search keyword of
"autonomous vehicles" or "automated vehicle technology" or
"driverless vehicle" or "self-driving vehicle" or "autonomous driving" to identify related research that aimed at Autonomous Vehicle capacities and abilities. These up-todate searches came out with 623 research papers, which were reduced to 453 and 362 articles after deleting non-peerreviewed and duplicated articles (this is shown in Table 2). It was further reduced to 158 after deleting non-English research articles. Fig. 4 illustrates the breakdown of how the articles used for this research were analysed considering the three academic databases used: Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO. Fig. 4 shows the PRISMA flowchart that was developed for the literature review. Fig. 5 shows the analysis of the search keywords in Fig. 5, "AV" is autonomous vehicles, "AVT" is automated vehicle technology, "DV" is driverless vehicle, "AD" is autonomous driving, "SDV" is selfdriving vehicle.

## 4. Autonomous Vehicle Technology

In the last few years, autonomous vehicle technology has been making headway in road transportation systems, especially in the shape of advanced driver assistance systems
(ADAS), which can be found in research and public transportation vehicles. Autonomous vehicle technologies aim to reduce or increase vehicular crashes, enhance the mobility of people with disabilities, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and encourage transportation infrastructure applications more effectively (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2015). One of the primary reasons why there is an acceleration of advancement of autonomous vehicle technologies is avoidable human-dependent errors such as human fatigue

and distractions when driving. All these human errors have been known to be the primary cause of 93% of road accidents from a statistical survey from NHTSA (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2015). The processes involved in the navigation of autonomous vehicles are shown in Fig. 6.

Currently, a primary issue is the occurrence of a brand new, unsafe act of driving by drivers who do not want to adhere to or understand the guidelines and ethical obligations when it comes to using AV-related technologies (Kyriakidis et al., 2019; Lowry et al., 2015). Additionally, it is of paramount importance for self-driving features and vehicles to significantly enhance the driving safety of vehicles and pedestrians, improving the mobility and effectiveness of AV
technologies. Pedestrians and drivers must have a rudimentary understanding of the abilities of the AV
technology (Kyriakidis et al., 2015, 2019). This comprises important features like technological limitations and technology usage, not excluding the suitable occurrences to apply or depend on the AV technology.

It is important to note that the navigation framework of an autonomous vehicle can be categorized into five primary components (Fig. 6). According to Cheng (2011), these five components are perception, localization and mapping, path planning, decision making, and vehicle control. Perception applies sensors to regularly scan and supervise the driving environment, which is almost similar to the vision of a human being (Maurer et al., 2016). Other components such as localization and mapping algorithms can be used to evaluate the global and local environment of the ego-vehicle and map the environment by using the sensor data and perception outputs (Maurer et al., 2016). AVs' primary components such as path planning can be used to evaluate

![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)

215 ).

The AV component functions as investigating the optimal driving route depending on the likely driving paths, the present state of the AV, and the information on the driving environment such as features of the road, traffic signs, and

![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)

unpredictable weather conditions (Maurer et al., 2016). In addition to this, the module associated with the vehicle control will then evaluate the suitable vehicle command, such as the vehicular acceleration, the angle of the steering wheel, and the torque. The evaluation is done to adhere to the appropriate decision-making regarding changing lanes or manoeuvring (Gruyer et al., 2016). It is imperative to understand that the navigation process of an AV involves an elevated frequency level of a recursive process. This elevated frequency enables AVs to supervise and control movable objects efficiently and possess high speed, for example, pedestrians, motorbikes, and vehicles (Julier and Durrant-whyte, 2003).

It is a common occurrence that vehicles usually possess their drive-by-wire functionality. This statement means that various distinct driving mechanisms, including but not limited to steering, can be supervised and controlled by a joystick or sophisticated computer software. This offers an interface between the hardware and software. The sensors fitted in the vehicles are interconnected to a group of computing systems connected to share data. The computing systems comprise the output connected to the steering wheel's motors, brake, and throttle. This computing system drives the vehicle.

Autonomous vehicles' intelligence allows them to autonomously navigate a traffic flow at a freeway or a road intersection can be found in the vehicle's software. This intelligence software functions as a tool for mapping the sensory percept of the sensors' sensors to the actuators' activation. However, the mapping is complicated, considering that many sensors create so much data information applied in complex manoeuvres navigation. Therefore, a gradual and hierarchical method is adopted, at which point having a proper clarity of the function ability of sensor percept occurs in various ways applied to create a world map. Another use of a sensor in autonomous vehicles is in the determination of the location of the vehicle. The autonomous vehicle's motion arrangement depends on a map representation of the world and the vehicle's GPS. Motion planning occurs in various distinct stages of hierarchies. The trajectory of the autonomous vehicle created by motion planning is imperative to the control algorithms. The vehicle can be controlled and send necessary signals to the actuation units.

Autonomous driving is therefore in continuous evolution and development. Although current automotive innovation has reached astonishing levels of automation, an even greater acceleration is expected in the coming years. The ultimate goal, which many car manufacturers are aiming for, is to reach level 5, ensuring that the driver is always safe and comfortable to drive.The automotive industry is working on optimising technologies to be implemented in autonomous vehicles and improve road transport, logistics and personal vehicles. Sensors are certainly critical components of autonomous vehicles. They can detect objects in the path of the vehicle and act as eyes, providing data from which autonomous decisions can be made. Cameras play a key role in image classification and interpretation (texture) and are currently the most valuable and widely used sensor type. They are the main sensors used by advanced driver assistance systems
(ADAS) for frontal vision and recognition of traffic signals. The data acquired by the sensors convey information of crucial importance for vehicle decision-making. Several of the sensors used in today's autonomous vehicles incorporate advanced functionalities that enable them to handle all possible driving scenarios in all environmental conditions.

High dynamic range (HDR) is a critical and critically important specification of camera sensors. This parameter defines the sensor's ability to record information in different lighting conditions within a scene (where obviously there will be lighter and darker parts) without over- or under-saturation.

The use of sensors with higher and higher resolutions is another important technological trend in the field of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles must not only be able to see further, but also detect objects of any size. This makes it possible to increase the number of pixels per degree on the object and gives greater efficiency to the automatic driving algorithms, which are then able to perform object detection and classification tasks (Royo and Ballesta-garcia, 2019).

For autonomous vehicles of level 3 and above, the dependence on hardware and software for decision-making is very high, not to mention that the vehicles themselves are more exposed to the danger of cyber attacks and fraudulent access
(hacking). This has led to the development of numerous protection and security features. Another technology used in autonomous vehicles is LiDAR, although the cost is high. LiDAR's ability to create a 3D point cloud sets it apart from other sensing technologies. The objective is not only to detect an object on the road, but also to make a classification, provide feedback to the decision-making system and modify the vehicle's route when necessary. The reflectivity of an object also plays a crucial role. While current LiDARs are able to remotely detect objects with high reflectivity, further improvements are needed to enable these devices to detect objects with low reflectivity over long distances (Royo and Ballesta-garcia, 2019).

Radar is another popular type of sensor that is of critical importance for the future of self-driving vehicles. The advantages of radar are evident during night-time driving and in all weather conditions. Millimetre-wave radars are a particular class of radars that use electromagnetic waves with short wavelengths and are rapidly gaining popularity in autonomous driving applications. By acquiring the reflected signal, a radar is able to determine the range, speed and angle of objects. A further advantage is that more integrated and compact designs can be achieved without the need for large, visible antennas (Bilik et al., 2019).

Autonomous vehicles are undoubtedly one of the most eagerly anticipated innovations that will radically change the lifestyles of millions of people around the world. As this technology becomes more accessible to the general public, the overall effects-whether positive or negative-will have a significant impact. In particular, traditional and new car manufacturers are pursuing several actions aimed at developing both personally owned production vehicles and robo-taxis.

Despite advances in technology and interest from the public and businesses, the autonomous vehicle industry is still facing many challenges, foremost of which is safety.

Although with some progress on safety, the regulation that could enforce safety requirements is largely absent, and it is still unclear how local authorities will administer the laws and regulations governing the use of autonomous vehicles. Some states have enacted legislation for autonomous vehicles.

Another challenge with the technology is trying to understand the area in which AVs can be most useful. One industry sector that is crying out for autonomous vehicles is the truck sector, which suffers from a widespread shortage of drivers. An autonomous vehicle on the motorway is much easier than driving an autonomous vehicle in the city. Autonomous vehicles are not at the stage where car manufacturers thought they would be by now. However, some vehicles are operating commercially with safety drivers inside. While some are focussing on trucks on highways because it's easier than driving in cities and doesn't contain many intersections, others are limiting the scope of their version of autonomous vehicle technology by geography, location or weather conditions.

In general, autonomous vehicle technology is still firmly in the experimental phase. It is possible to divide the mission of an autonomous driving system into four main steps: The first step is detection and perception, using a software system on top of an array of sensors including cameras, radar, lidar and ultrasonic sensors. The sensors observe the world around the vehicle to detect its surroundings. The next step is to make sense of all the different objects surrounding the vehicle (e.g., object recognition, pedestrians, cyclists, other vehicles and roadside objects). After prediction, the next step is to plan a route for a vehicle to drive through that environment. The final step is control. This is where the system sends signals to the steering, brakes and accelerator to get the car or truck where it needs to go. One of the thorniest problems for autonomous vehicle technology is the prediction phase. While it might be easy for the autonomous vehicle to figure out what other vehicles might do, pedestrians are relatively unpredictable and can easily change their minds at any time.

## 4.1. Advantages Of Autonomous Vehicle Technology

In the past decade, autonomous vehicles have been proposed to be operated both as non-commercial and as public vehicles in the not-too-distant future (Collingwood, 2017; Heinrichs, 2016; Wadud, 2017). One of the merits and flexibility of autonomous private vehicles compared to conventional private vehicles is that they can simultaneously be used among all family members, depending on the size of the family. Non-private autonomous vehicles can be used as commercial taxis, transit buses, or freight services. Public autonomous taxis can offer services as a combination of traditional car-sharing and taxi services, known as shared autonomous vehicles (SAV) or driverless public taxis (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2014; Krueger et al., 2016). Public perception prevails that driverless public taxi is likely to improve public transportation systems. It can likely replace or reduce the usage of private vehicle ownerships because SAVs are expected to be cheap and aid opportunities for multitasking when driving (Krueger et al., 2016; Malokin et al., 2015; Milakis et al., 2017). Despite the cooperation traditional taxi drivers have when they use conventional vehicles, they still want to profit maximization and shorter travel time (Boesch et al., 2016).

Some transportation companies, such as Uber and Lyft, have been trying to create a model that is no different from SAVs in their daily operations. However, although its process is autonomous in this model, human drivers oversee its driving routing, relocation, driving operation times, and other immediate driving environment decision-making features. Despite that, 100% central control system of SAV can tackle the limitations of non-autonomous taxi services. Therefore, SAV can create more system-optimal and ensure a comprehensive profit-maximizing transportation network with a higher service level and lower cost of travel time when compared to conventional public taxi services and transportation companies (Fagnant et al., 2015). SAV can expedite dynamic ridesharing (DRS) by applying a comprehensive information communication technology. Therefore, SAV
could provide driving services with or without DRS (Krueger et al., 2016). The limitations or problems associated with conventional ridesharing services can be addressed or tackled via the application of DRS (Krueger et al., 2016) or driverless public taxis (Martinez and Viegas, 2017). The theoretical framework of mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) can also be accommodated with the application of SAV and DRS.

Public transportation operations such as taxi, bus, and freight services can benefit from the use of automation by reducing driver's cost of expenses (Wadud, 2017).

The application of driverless private vehicles of taxis will reduce the demand for parking spaces in malls and offices, making these spaces available for other economic activities or for constructing and expanding more roads or road lanes. This may lead to an increase in urban migration (Bagloee et al., 2016; Levine et al., 2017). However, reliability in the mode of travelling, comfortability, and travel time reduction may likely lead to long commuting distances, contributing to metropolitan cities' expansion and influencing real-estate prices city's outskirts (Heinrichs, 2016; Rubin, 2016; Snyder, 2016). With the assistance of autonomous and cooperative technology, the introduction of platooning characteristics in freight and public bus transportation services will significantly increase the capacities of roads in public transportation. These are a few well-known examples of autonomous vehicles regarding their diversity in application.

As discussed in the paragraphs above, AVs' modern technological improvement and advantages are all connected (Heinrichs, 2016).

## 4.2. Limitations Of Autonomous Vehicle Technology

In the last few years, the world has experienced a lot of revolutionary changes when it comes to road transportation systems and the integration of artificial intelligence into the foundational framework of road transportation systems
(Olayode et al., 2021b, 2021c; Ukaegbu et al., 2021a). Some of the revolutionary changes are also because of the rapid technological innovations in engineering, science, and technology, for example, the wide human usage of laptops and AI portable devices. The introduction of autonomous vehicle technologies into the road transportation system has been regarded as one of the significant breakthroughs in the last few years. It also may propose a significant threat in the future years to come. However, it is important to understand the limitations associated with the introduction of autonomous vehicle technologies in road transportation systems; understanding the limitation will pave the way for developing feasible solutions to tackle these limitations
(Howard and Dai, 2014). Table 3 presents the tabular information's on the limitations of autonomous driving technologies.

4.2.1. Technological efficiency The first significant challenge that must be tackled to introduce self-driving vehicles to reality is creating suitable autonomous driving technology. However, despite the tremendous technological advancements that have been made in terms of autonomous driving technology, most AVs manufacturers are still struggling with safety issues when it comes to the immediate driving environment. Artificial intelligence algorithms which are applied for identifying the immediate driving environment of a vehicle are not strong enough when it comes to efficiency and effectiveness in operating in unstable urban driving environments, and also these technologies struggle in unstable weather conditions such as hurricanes, typhoons, and heavy snowfalls (Bezerra and Gomes, 2015). Additionally, autonomous vehicles require high resolution and are well detailed for navigation compared to the present being used (Levinson et al., 2011a).

Finally, when it comes to communications between autonomous vehicles, there must be no breakdown in communication because such breakdowns can lead to unpredictable disastrous consequences (Gerla et al., 2014).

4.2.2. Protection of data and privacy Data privacy and protection remain one of the most severe threats to the functionality of autonomous vehicles. Personal information is significant for the software servers of autonomous vehicles (Glancy, 2012). This personal information may comprise sensitive information on the owner or driver of the vehicle, such as phone number, address, location, and gender. Although it is not clear who will want to use this information for their benefit, it has been discovered that online hackers have hacked this information over the years. Exorbitant ransoms are being asked from individuals whose information is hacked. This is one of the primary reasons people are skeptical about uploading their biodata online, even if the car-making company assured them zero security breaches.

4.2.3. Cyber security Another significant issue regarding AVs similar to the above limitation is the ease at which hackers can hack with ease any software. And the increase in vulnerability of these software's to outside hackers. At present, it is possible that someone that hacks your car can have access to your biodata, and they can use this information to take over the control of your car even without you knowing it. These can lead to terrorist attacks in some exceptional circumstances (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2015). In conclusion, autonomous vehicles must be verified Table 3 e Summary of limitations of autonomous driving technology.

to be 100% protected from hackers and outside interferences before they are introduced into the road transportation system.

4.2.4. Legislation-liability surrounding AVs In the last few years, transportation researchers have discovered that the problem of legislation and liabilities is becoming a significant roadblock for the integration of AVs into road transportation notable among these roadblocks is that each nation in the world have their required age of when you are supposed to start driving a car, for example, the age you can start driving a vehicle is 18 years old in South Africa while in Australia it is 16 years old, and this all depends on the person passing their driving license examination. Another major roadblock is the liability problem in case there are road accidents involving AVs, liabilities which are usually judged according to the driving code of that country. These roadblocks are usually caused because AVs are still regarded as an innovative transportation system, so there is no legislation or requirements for them to be integrated into urban transportation. Also, there is the problem of who should take responsibility if an accident happens because an autonomous vehicle is a driverless vehicle, nobody is driving the vehicle. All these roadblocks concerning legislation and liabilities need to be removed before autonomous vehicles can smooth integration into the transportation market (Hevelke and NidaRu¨melin, 2015).

## 5. Public Perceptions Of Autonomous Vehicles

Existing studies have examined the features related to human interests in autonomous vehicles, people's attitudes towards autonomous vehicles technology, and the level of willingness to buy, drive, and adopt autonomous technologies. Many researchers have indicated that adults and grown-up males are the two demographics that have more open and positive perceptions concerning autonomous vehicle technology
(Anania et al., 2018; Hulse et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2017; Nielsen and Haustein, 2018). Specifically, young adults and men have been investigated to be more agreeable to the conception that autonomous vehicles will enhance driver and motorists' safety (Nielsen and Haustein, 2018), have non-existent concerns about the safety of autonomous vehicles in the immediate driving environment (Kyriakidis et al., 2015; Schoettle and Sivak, 2014), and are willing to apply the technology (Smith and Anderson, 2017; Payre et al., 2014). Considering these demographics, they have been related to dangerous motorists' behaviour (Turner and Mcclure, 2003)
and dangerous behaviour of pedestrians (Holland and Hill, 2007; Rosenbloom, 2009). All these behaviours are related to the elevated possibility of collision, resulting in the worst road safety consequences. Due to these behavioural occurrences, Hulse et al. (2018) stated that the positive attitudes of male adults towards autonomous vehicles may likely lead to more elevated manifestations of the benefits of road safety.

Additionally, research has shown that young adults, especially men and university educated adults and residents of metropolitan cities, have positive perceptions of autonomous vehicles, including the willingness to apply this technology (Schoettle and Sivak, 2014; Smith and Anderson, 2017)
and increased attitudes towards the safety of AVs (Nielsen and Haustein, 2018; Schoettle and Sivak, 2014). Research carried out by Sanbonmatsu et al. (2018) discovered that the increased knowledge of the operations of AVs is related to the agreement that they would be unsafe because of technological limitations and insufficient familiarity with the operations of AVs; however, self-reported perceived technological-know-how of autonomous vehicles had a negative correlation with these beliefs. However, several researchers have investigated and indicated the significant attitudinal characteristics that explain these attitudes (Choi and Ji, 2015; Nees, 2016; Tussyadiah et al., 2017). A research investigated in Denmark stated three classes of respondents depending on reported attitudes: enthusiasts, skeptics, and an indifferent group in between with higher car stress.

Enthusiasts were primarily likely to have a college degree, try new innovative technologies in the adoption curve, reside in Copenhagen, and probably be young males. The likely merits of autonomous vehicles, such as driving safety, indicated the biggest gap between skeptics and enthusiast respondents; in contrast, 56.8% of enthusiasts indicated a belief that driverless vehicles would ensure road safety, only about 7.4% of skeptics and 20.7% of indifferent individuals are of the opinion about the same (Nielsen and Haustein, 2018).

## 5.1. Global Comparisons On Human Perceptions Of Autonomous Vehicles

Investigations carried out by multiple nations have shown that people's perceptions about autonomous vehicles and the socio-demographics that predict autonomous vehicles operations are widely different among countries. Haboucha et al.

(2017) discovered that people's gender played an important role in predicting perceptions of autonomous vehicles in Israel, indicating that adult males are more interested when compared to their female counterparts. Still, the opposite is the case in the United States of America because there is no significant difference in perceptions of gender to AVs. The authors concluded that their research implications, especially regarding human perceptions of AVs, are because of the cultural differences between Israel and the USA.

Anania et al. (2018) carried out research on the perceptions of Indian society on AVs. They discovered that Indian women are more willing to use autonomous vehicles than their Indian men. However, the opposite is the case in the United States of America. The men embrace the idea of AVs more than the women. Research using a methodological approach involving participants from developed countries such as Germany, China, Japan, and the United States discovered a major disparity in attitudes towards autonomous driving in these four developed countries
(Sommer, 2013). In the research, about 45% and 62% of participants in Japan and the United States consider autonomous driving as dangerous to pedestrians and motorists. About 74% of participants in China believe that autonomous technology is reliable, and only 38% in Japan believe that autonomous vehicles will be part of our daily lives in the future. An investigation on the public perception of pedestrians on AVs was conducted in 2014 in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia in which they concluded that there is a significant difference in attitudes participants used in the research; for example, participants from the United States have positive mindsets when it comes to using AVs, but they are also concerned about the safety of riding in it as compared with participants from other developed countries (Schoettle and Sivak, 2014).

Table 4 shows the various types of related research of human perceptions regarding AVs.

The pie chart shown in Fig. 7 shows the number of factors or key determinants identified (Table 4) as human perceptions regarding AVs. From Fig. 7, the size of each slice represents the level of human perceptions or concerns regarding AVs, and it is constructed based on the frequency of each perception among the various studies. From the plot, a combination of other factors such as gender, cost of AV technology, trust, legal labilities, safety, and control as well as consequences regarding the use of AV technology had the highest (12.93%)
variables of human perception (see column chart). This is an indication of the level or majority of concerns spanning from these factors. Loss of vehicle control (10.34%), liability
(10.34%) and equipment failure (10.34%) followed as factors that determine public or human opinions towards AV technologies.

## 6. Application Of Autonomous Mobilities In The Transportation Of People And Goods 6.1. Autonomous Shuttles

The autonomous shuttles comprise no driver seats, steering wheel, or accelerating or brake pad pedals. They are programmed to adhere to an already existing route while associating with other vehicles and pedestrians in their immediate driving environment. The autonomous shuttles themselves are fully equipped with sensors and computing capacities, and they assist the autonomous shuttles in perceiving their environment and correcting themselves when facing any driving emergencies. This is to ensure the safety of the passengers. The organization and management of mobility services within urban areas and satisfying the expectations of pedestrians is gradually becoming a complex and challenging task. The inability of conventional transportation systems models to tackle this task has been compounded by the proliferation of alternative options such as social and grassroots frameworks to achieve a flexible mode of transportation, for example, carpooling and ride-sharing services.

Some of these objectives have been achieved, especially with the successful introduction of Uber and Lyft in public road transportation network. However, these solutions are not enough. It is only focused on specific mobility groups and not all the mobility ecosystems, which are primarily dependent on traditional public and private transportation systems. However, recent research studies carried out by mobilities researchers only evaluate queuing-related problems with autonomous cars in smart urban areas (Cui et al.,
2018). There is a need for a new approach in managing the transportation of people and goods and services required in sustainable smart urban cities. Researchers have stated that the introduction of driving autonomously in city driving environments is still a challenge (Rasouli and Tsotsos, 2019), and there is little or no research finding solutions or discussing these problems. Research done on smart transportation has created dynamics models used for the connected automated vehicles (CAV) -dependent traffic control system (Zhang et al., 2018) and application of V2X channels of communications (Kuutti et al., 2018). In recent years, the concepts of the mobility-as-a-service ecosystem have been experiencing severe challenges in providing effective services due to short distances (Peled et al., 2019).

The reason why a new mobility model was introduced was that there is a need for the introduction and operation of a new mobility model to use autonomous shuttles as a primary provider of services that are innovative and efficient, which is also known as autonomous shuttle as a service (ASaaS). ASaaS
offers support for an efficient shared, non-rigid, and contextualized delivery of goods and services in the area known as last-mile mobility. According to Bucchiarone et al. (2020) there is an expectation that mobility services providers will provide different types of ASaaS products in a modular and extensible way. The merits of these are that it will assist in designing mobility architectures that will be flexible in adaptation to delivery of services to different types of customers such as citizens, tourists, and aged people and not excluding market advertising and last-mile delivery of goods and services. The autonomous shuttle as a service model is of benefits to the following users.

 Municipalities: this is useful to municipalities and communities via cost reduction, traffic congestion, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and gradual decrease in energy consumption.

 The city service providers: These providers can be government-owned or privately-owned companies. They offer them a more customer base coupled with the service flexibility needed to run day-to-day activities more costeffectively.

The collectivity assists the emergence and diffusion of creative, intelligent mobility solutions that are aiding in reducing traffic jams in urban areas and promoting the right to autonomous mobility in rural and disadvantaged areas. The primary aim of the ASaaS model is to create an information technology template that will support the definition and implementation of a portfolio of city mobility services that are i) are tailored-made to satisfy the travellers needs and choices to and that, at the same time, ii) exploit synergistically and collectively the pre-existing mobility services. The similarity is that these mobility services make use of technology behind the autonomous shuttle hardware and software that can be configured to be used in any environment (i.e., shopping malls, hospitals, private companies, stadiums, university surroundings, etc.) and for different types of aims such as management of events, delivery of goods and services and security management.

Different models use sophisticated theoretical and empirical models for autonomous shuttle services tailored to university surroundings (Kim et al., 2017; Peled et al., 2019). These models are tested and trusted, and environmentally friendly. By referring to Bucchiarone et al. (2020), the ASaaS platform is uniformly organized in three primary layers (Fig. 8), and its objectives are: providing services for mobility operators (both public and privately owned) to design, customize and maintain mobility packages that do service integration using available autonomous shuttles. The Enablers offer a group of services such as multimodal travel planner and analytics using mobility and applied results from Bucchiarone et al.

(2012, 2013) for enabling a dynamic and a group of more dynamic and collective management of mobility elucidation such as a group of adaptation facilities. The Services layer exposes the functionalities applied by the enablers platforms as services, which can be used to create a frontend application (front-end layer) for travellers. They may be individuals or groups and mobility operators. The model explained in this section creates emerging innovative opportunities for new business models and actors. The implications of these opportunities showcased that peer-topeer form of transportation is a significant sector of Europe's socio-economy (Kim et al., 2015a) taking into consideration the revenues (as of 2015, Europe's revenue is at 1.66 billion)
and there is an expectancy that this sector will continue to become a crucial sector in the next decade with over 33 billion Euro of revenues projected (Burns, 2013). Mobility-asa-service is an important example of an emerging market that wants to find solution to the transportation needs of users by buying services at reduced costs than those spent on private transportation. This market will apply fixed price rates and roaming opportunities already been widely applied by telecommunication industries in the concepts of mobility-as-a-service.

## 6.2. Applications

Autonomous technologies in goods' transportation rapidly grow faster and lighter years from becoming a reality. Companies in the supply chain industries can create an advantage by efficiently applying autonomous technologies to their daily logistics operations. Recently, there has been much technological advancement in creating autonomous technologies.

This technological advancement has been touted as the next
'big revolution' in the mobility of goods in the logistics and supply chain sector. There are several reasons why introducing autonomous mobility in the logistic and supply chain industry will be innovative.

 Applying autonomous technologies in warehouses, industrial plants, and isolated outdoor geographical locations is more accessible than applying AVs in road transportation.

 Using autonomous technologies to transport goods and services will not be restricted by too many laws and regulations than AVs in road transportation.

 For logistics and supply chain industries, introducing autonomous technologies in material handling of goods, specifically in dispatching, scheduling, and routing, will minimize cost and save time concerning the production and delivery process.

The movement of people, goods, and services is crucial for transportation planning and smart cities' decision-making.

Due to efficient shared mobility and interconnectivity, intelligent cities focus on walking, cycling, and public transportation. This is to fast-track the evolution of zero gas emission vehicles (electric vehicles), promote climate change and breathing efficacy. To make this a reality, developed cities are introducing technological measures to reduce the usage of cars, single-passenger taxis, and other oversized public transport vehicles. This was done to encourage people to practice sustainable mobility behaviour (Alonso Raposo et al., 2019). In recent years, developed countries have shifted their focus by investing heavily in infrastructural and technological innovations that are important in supporting a connected, multimodal transportation network comprising autonomous electric vehicles (AVs). These vehicles will function as a replacement for ineffective bus lines(Alonso Raposo et al., 2019). Also, transportation researchers on autonomous vehicles have been able to identify a practicable manoeuvre to minimize the threat of a collision, and Gelbal et al. (2020) proffered an innovative method for low-velocity autonomous shuttles to avoid colliding with pedestrians in a real-time situation.

Usually, autonomous vehicles have the necessary capability to travel from one place to another without human control. They can also sense their driving environment and implement safety mechanisms such as steering or braking without human interference. There are many merits and demerits that autonomous mobility will have on people and stakeholders in the logistics industry (Gonzalez-gonz  alez et al., 2019; Stead and Vaddadi, 2019). One of the merits of autonomous mobility in the logistics and supply chain industry is introducing the TIAGo Base, an autonomous technology introduced in the logistics industry to assist with logistics and stock control in the warehouse. This TIAGo Base (Fig. 9) is also called "autonomous mobile robots (AMR)", which can transport goods from one position to another with a maximum mass of 100 kg.

There are also stockbots, which is another autonomous technology in the transportation of goods. They can automatically do inventories in warehouses and manufacturing plants. They interact well with their immediate environment by using sophisticated vision technologies to control stocks in the warehouse safely. Problems associated with urban logistics in the movement of goods and services have become a pertinent topic for transportation planning. In the last decade, urban planners and logistics experts have tried to investigate the problems related to transporting goods within the urban environment by investigating some local authorities, transportation industries, supply chain companies, and pedestrians (Taniguchi et al., 2004). Investigating these problems is essential in developing solutions that will minimize traffic congestion in developed cities and lead to logistics and supply chain companies' delivery process efficiency.

However, several researchers have concluded investigations on transportation and delivery of goods and services, including retail deliveries and courier companies. There is still a need for more research in this area. Urban transportation of goods and services comprises waste transportation, equipment, and construction materials (Russo and Comi, 2011). Taniguchi et al. (2001) explained that city logistics plays a vital role in improving transportation logistics by using state-of-the-art information systems in urban areas. The upsurge in the complexity of interorganizational frameworks and a corresponding reduction of sophisticated logistics infrastructural technologies needed to accelerate the efficiency and effectiveness of pre-existing logistics processes have negatively affected the transportation of goods and services. The elevated levels of mobility in urban areas have influenced logistics methodologies' development and control in a dynamic environment (Bemeleit et al., 2008).

Despite different research studies carried out in the field of models associated with urban logistics (Brownell, 2013; de Carvalho, 2004; Robuste et al., 2002  ; Wisetjindawat et al.,
2007; Vleugel and Janic, 2004), urban logistics is not as essential in urban planning compared to the transportation of goods by road. This is because of cost optimization and efficacy in the supply chain (Nemoto et al., 2004). The increase in demand for mobility has challenged researchers across the various academic fields to design and create more effective traffic and transportation systems. These include control equipment's information systems and techniques to optimize pre-existing transportation networks. Bazzan and Klugl (2005) stated that it is of fundamental importance that models that incorporate interdisciplinary strategies are developed.

Taniguchi et al. (2004) explained that the problem ofmobility could be solved from three perspectives: autonomous mobility, sustainability, and feasibility. They also presents some characteristics related to the challenges urban transportation of goods is experiencing. Some existing systems can adequately develop a futuristic vision of how urban goods and services are supposed to work. A major historical event in history was when the fourth industrial revolution was ushered into transportation and how it has changed the handling of manufacturing and logistical processes. Autonomous and machines have replaced manual production processes and transportation of goods. From the beginning of the 18th century, innovative and disruptive technologies have revolutionized the world economy and steered it to automate information, production, and logistics. In recent years, global digitization, electric vehicles, connectivity, accessibility, and autonomous vehicles are game-changing ingenuities affecting how contemporary business models and operational flows are being utilized (Gao et al., 2016). Decades ago, autonomous vehicles sounded like a dream. However, recent changes in the transportation industries have been suggested. Otherwise, it looks more realistic as more innovative technologies have been developed.

The autonomous vehicle in the future will change the way we use or see transportation, but it will also change the way we transport goods and services. Autonomous mobility will have a significant role to play in the global operation of logistics and supply chains. Autonomous mobility will have a robust impact on the breakdown of expenses of logistics industries. This can be in lowering stress levels of drivers of heavy vehicles, assistance in overcoming the challenges of long-distance travelling, and creating an innovative way to transport goods and services worldwide. However, actualizing autonomous mobility in the transportation of goods is experiencing difficulties. These difficulties can be research and development expenses, ethical issues, legal guidelines, and road transportation public unions.

Grahle et al. (2020) stated that autonomous mobility would play a significant role in urban transportation. The effects of this disruptive innovation (autonomous mobility) can lead to the reduction of carbon production and travel times reduction. Furthermore, autonomous mobility can also lead to the likelihood of traffic reduction, traffic congestion, and car accidents that are primarily caused by errors in the driver's decision-making process, tiredness, drunkenness, or indiscriminate usage of drugs (Morando et al., 2018; Olayode et al., 2022; Severino et al., 2021). Nevertheless, although the security levels granted by such an intelligent system are forecasted to improve over the years, numerous experimental tests have already been carried out on nonrural road networks (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2015). The next decade's market penetration of autonomous mobility technologies cannot be assured (Kockelman et al., 2016). Notwithstanding, many transportation researchers are still undertaking studies on the introduction of autonomous mobility technologies to transport goods and services, including their interaction with the immediate driving environment.

## 7. The Impacts Of Autonomous Vehicles On Road Transportation 7.1. Safety

The implementation of autonomous vehicles in developed countries has drastically reduced road accidents. More than 40% of fatal car crashes usually involve drinking alcohol, overdosing on marijuana, or fatigue. A self-driving vehicle will not be affected because it relies on little or no human interference in its navigation. It is rare for an autonomous vehicle to malfunction to the extent of causing an accident on the road. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (2008), Almost 90% of car crashes on the road are caused by an error from a vehicle's driver. The potential benefits of using an autonomous vehicle are comprehensive, both economically and environmentally, for any country. More than 30 to 40 thousand people die every year from death related to vehicles' collisions on the road in the United States of America (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2012), with 2.2 million people getting injured due to these crashes (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2013). At the same time, there are many positive impacts of using autonomous vehicles on the road, some negative impacts, such as the autonomous vehicles' inability to recognize objects or a person by the roadside quickly. Researchers have already predicted that AVs will overcome this problem in the future and recognize the object and persons on the road.

## 7.2. Traffic Congestion

Apart from making roads accident-free, transportation researchers have also come up with ways by which autonomous can safely reduce traffic congestion on highways and road intersections by developing an external sensor that can easily sense the lead car decision-making involving braking and acceleration. Such developments will reduce brake wear, reduce travel times, and save fuel cost/energy consumptions.

Adaptive cruise control has already been introduced into autonomous vehicle systems that assist autonomous vehicles in decision-making, such as route choices and platoon coordination. There is a need for a 95% introduction of autonomous vehicles into the road transportation network, if the use of autonomous intersections is going to be implemented in the foreseeable future (Dresner and Stone, 2008). Another significant impact of autonomous vehicles in reducing traffic congestion is the advantage of vehicles travelling close together which lead to a significant upsurge in road capacity on existing road lanes (Olayode et al., 2020b, 2021a, 2021c; Tientrakool et al., 2011).

## 7.3. Travel Behaviour

Autonomous vehicles will change the travel behaviour of people, especially in the following areas.

 Provision of mobility for elderly, disabled, and people too young to drive.

 There will be a change in parking patterns in urban areas.

There will be fewer illegal parking on-road lanes, which will lead to more road capacity for vehicles.

 The car ride-sharing programs will expand, leading to fewer vehicles on the road, reducing traffic congestion.
These can be achieved by vehicle-miles travelled (VMT)
and vehicular-oriented development. Unless demand management is carefully implemented, all these travel behaviour can be implemented (Gupta et al., 2006). According to recent studies, it has been shown that there is an increment in the miles of vehicles travelled because of autonomous vehicles.

Thereby leading to a reduction in parking expenses of vehicles and an increase in market shares of autonomous vehicles (Auld et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2015b). Research into non-public autonomous vehicles (de Almeida Correia and van Arem, 2016; Kroger et al., 2019 € ) reported a broad mode shift when there is an increase in the reduction of value of time and parking or operating costs of autonomous vehicles. According to the effect of autonomous vehicles on a vehicle, hours travelled research studies (Childress et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015b) from the research studies. It shows that vehicle hours travelled increases concerning private autonomous vehicles. It is an assumption that leads to a reduction in parking expenses.

## 8. Discussions

This study presents an unprecedented systematic literature review on the significance of autonomous technologies in the transportation of humans, goods, and services by torch lighting research articles via using search keywords such as autonomous vehicles, self-driving vehicles, and automated vehicle technology using the Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO as the academic databases. This research also investigates the socio-demographic genders in various countries (using developing and developed countries as a yardstick)
to discover which gender in these countries' perceptions on autonomous technologies in terms of positivity towards AVs travel safety. Our review validates and extends previous research carried out by different transportation researchers that young adult males are more liberal and progressive regarding the risk associated with automated driving.

This research discovers from the existing literature review that young adult males between the ages of 18 and 35 are a primary demographic that reports elevated levels of positive perceptions of the safety of automated vehicle technology. It is important to note that young adult males are more connected to dangerous driving and aggressive road behaviour
(Holland and Hill, 2007; Rosenbloom, 2009; Turner and Mcclure, 2003), their widely acknowledged non-negativity aimed at autonomous vehicle safety and early application of autonomous vehicle technology could likely result in an enormous rapid actualization of road transportation safety advantages (Hulse et al., 2018).

Our research also validates and extends literature review on the history and comprehensive definitions of different levels of autonomous vehicles, especially when it comes to the theoretical, conceptual framework of autonomous vehicles, not excluding their functionalities and technologies. Furthermore, another significant contribution of this systematic review is that many developed countries have started to invest more and more in autonomous technologies over the last few years. The COVID-19 pandemic and global warming have accelerated this kind of technology investment in autonomous technologies. This is because developed countries are now pledging to phase out fuel-driven vehicles in the next decade and focus more on hybrid and electric vehicles, which possess a core framework of automated vehicle technology.

The most striking observation from this review is African countries' lack of innovation and creativity regarding automated vehicle technology. Only South Africa has tried to introduce the fourth industrial revolution in all aspects of its road transportation by encouraging more importation and driving hybrid electric vehicles on its roads. No African country has come close to fully allowing automated vehicle technology in its immediate driving environment.

Contrary to expectations about when autonomous vehicles will be fully accessible in various road transportation systems, it is somewhat surprising that most developed countries, especially in the USA, China, and some European countries
(Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands), are miles behind when it comes to introducing all the SAE automation levels in their road transportation system. Another significant finding of this research is that the methodology applied in this research validates previous related literature review that discovers that metropolitan and University-graduate people have greater progressive public perceptions of the safety of autonomous vehicles. These people are more likely to be early users of autonomous vehicles in any developing or developed country due to their non-negativity progressive cognizance of AVs. These phenomena will likely elevate their intentions of buying and using AVs in their future day-to-day activities
(Payre et al., 2014).

We have noticed a pattern, and the pattern is that almost 90% of the reviewed articles all concluded that has been argued and debated over the last few years that "autonomous vehicles is the future". With the outbreak of COVID-19 and the mandatory implementation of social distancing in most countries, this conclusion looks at a possible reality. However, we have discovered that while the USA, UK, China, and some artificial intelligence developed European countries might be getting closer to fully implementing AVT in their transportation system. The majority of African countries are still decades away from even achieving level 4 of SAE automation levels (Level 4: the vehicle has the capacity of carrying out all driving functionalities supervised by some specific driving conditions. There is an alternative to either control or relinquish the control of the vehicles) talk less of implementing full automation in their road transportation system.

## 8.1. Conclusion And Future Work

This study investigated the most recent academic articles related to the significance, impacts, public perceptions and applications of autonomous vehicles in road transportation and we also shine a light on the application of autonomous mobility in the transport of goods and services using academic websites such as Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO. The search was conducted through a PRISMA driven methodology using specific keywords. In addition, we also discussed application scenarios of autonomous shuttles aiming at lastmile delivery of goods. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) could revolutionise public transportation. Yet, public perception and acceptance, safety implications, socio-economic repercussions, infrastructural requirements, legal and regulatory concerns, integration with public transportation systems, environmental impacts, and human aspects all affect AV integration into public transit. A thorough literature review was done to determine the importance, impacts, public views, and applications of AVs in road transportation.

This study found that AV incorporation into public transportation depends on public perception and acceptability.

Some surveys have revealed high public interest in AVs, others mixed. So, public attitudes and how they vary by demographic and geographic group must be better understood.

This information could help create focused public education and outreach programmes to boost AV acceptability in road transportation.

 AVs may also minimise traffic accidents and mortality.

Nonetheless, more research on their public transportation integration hazards and limitations is needed. In particular, AVs' interactions with pedestrians and cyclists must be understood to ensure their safe and successful operation in all conditions.

 AVs have complex socioeconomic effects. AVs could produce jobs in data analysis and software development, according to some research, but they could also diminish transportation jobs. So, additional research is needed to understand AVs' socio-economic effects and how to mitigate them.

 AV incorporation into public transit depends on infrastructure. To accommodate a large-scale AV deployment, traffic management systems, roads, highways, and charging and refuelling infrastructure must be upgraded.

AV infrastructure requirements and how to make these adjustments cost-effectively and sustainably need more investigation.

 AV legal and regulatory issues are complicated. New AVspecific regulations are needed. Understanding how AVs can be integrated into public transportation systems will require new technologies to manage and coordinate AVs with other modes. AV environmental consequences must be properly studied, including the development of new powering technologies and legislation to encourage their use. To safely deploy AVs, human aspects, especially drivers, must be studied.

This study has shown that the pace of advanced technological innovations in the transport of human goods is moving at lightning speed. The notion of transporting goods autonomously was once a dream and is now becoming a reality. This study found that, in general, transport researchers have proposed ideas and practical solutions on how to transport goods autonomously. Among the proposed solutions is the introduction of autonomous vehicles into the road transport system. This article has highlighted some of the benefits and current challenges of autonomous mobility in freight transport in the supply chain sector. The evidence from this study suggests that there is still a need for further research on the importance and how we can fully develop an autonomous system that can efficiently transport goods from one place to another. This research study has raised many questions that need further investigation. Additional research is needed to determine the effectiveness of using autonomous technologies in transporting goods and services from one place to another. The world of transport is evolving every day; there are still some grey areas in the development of autonomous technologies for the transport of goods, not to mention the need for further experimentation and feasibility studies on autonomous technologies in the logistics and supply chain sectors. Finally, future researchers should focus on using more keywords, to broaden their search on research related to autonomous vehicles, the world of autonomous vehicles are fast evolving, transportation researchers need to keep up with the trends and evolvement.

## 8.2. Limitations Of The Research

The findings of this systematic review paper are subject to at least three limitations.

 The removal of literature reviews that are not peerreviewed might have narrowed the spectrum of this research because most of the literature review papers not included in the methodology of this research have relatively torch lighted new fields on autonomous vehicles.

 The keywords used in the search for journal articles used for this systematic review could have excluded some relevant literature reviews for this research.

 The author's unintentional bias might have influenced the execution and findings of this systematic review.
