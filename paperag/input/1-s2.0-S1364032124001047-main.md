## 1. Introduction

Preventing catastrophic consequences for our planet requires urgent and decisive action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Governments and private institutions around the world have committed to various goals to minimize these emissions. Compared to 1990 levels, the European Union [1] has vowed to lower GHG emissions by at least 55%. Similarly, the United States [2], Japan [3], and India [4] have pledged to lower their GDP's emissions intensity by 35%–55%, all by the year 2030. The worldwide transportation industry is responsible for around 14% [5] of GHG emissions. In contrast, the electric power sector is responsible for about 42% of all GHG emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [6]. The US's main source of GHG emissions is transportation, with over 12 million barrels of oil burned daily. Based on current estimates, global energy consumption is predicted to increase by 28% from 2015 to 2040 [7]. The majority of this energy will be produced by burning fossil fuels in power plants, resulting in harmful environmental consequences such as air pollution, rising temperatures, and climate change. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2
) emitted by burning fossil fuels has risen nearly four-fold from 8.7 Gt in 1959 to 37.6 Gt in 2022 [8]. However, over the past few decades, numerous innovations have aimed at creating more sustainable and efficient travel communities prioritizing safety [9] as well in the direction of power generation by integrating more and more renewable energy sources (RES). The past fifty years have seen significant progress in the quest for a more sustainable transportation sector, from advancements in fuel-efficient technologies to developing low-carbon transportation alternatives. The penetration level of electric vehicles (EVs) is increasing day by day after changes in taxation policies and subsidies, low charging rates, highperformance vehicles, and awareness among the public. The segment in internal combustion engines (ICE) or EVs and the feature of advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS) or fully autonomous attracted users towards the new growing market of autonomous vehicles (AV) [10].

Besides that, the addition of internet connectivity in the EV/ICE vehicle segments provides more convenient utilization of vehicles on the road. Internet connectivity over the cellular network/Wifi allows communication with infrastructures or V2X communication. Such communication helps with understanding and decision-making based on real-time traffic information, payment services, roadside assistance, etc. Such vehicles are already on the road, known as connected vehicles
(CV) [11]. Lastly, apart from public transport, vehicle sharing and subscription concepts such as carpooling, bike sharing, renting, etc.,

R. Sumitkumar and A.S. Al-Sumaiti are introduced by private companies and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) [12].

The gaining popularity of shared vehicles (SV) and different business models increases adoption and convenient transportation. The vehicle is shared among multiple customers, meaning that individuals from different households or locations use the same vehicle to reach their respective destinations. This shared model is designed to enhance transportation efficiency, reduce traffic congestion, and lower the overall environmental impact of commuting. Combining all forms of the abovediscussed vehicle and transportation technology introduced the concept of shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV), also known as connected autonomous shared electric (CASE) vehicles. Ref. [13] stated that SAEV
is a competitive technology for urban mobility. With the increasing market share of electric vehicles, breakthroughs in battery technology, and the promise of automation, SAEV systems are expected to replace traditional gasoline-powered, human-driven car-sharing systems worldwide, offering increased flexibility in pick-up locations and freeing passengers from driving and seeking parking. Overall, SAEVs have the potential to improve the transportation system by reducing congestion, improving air quality, increasing accessibility, saving costs, increasing safety, and increasing efficiency. However, integrating SAEVs into the power network (PN) and transportation network (TN) also comes with several challenges that must be addressed.

One of the significant challenges of integrating SAEVs into TN is the need for significant infrastructure changes. This includes building charging stations for EVs and dedicated lanes or routes for autonomous vehicles [22]. Without the necessary infrastructure, SAEVs may struggle to operate efficiently and reliably. Another challenge is developing and implementing regulations that govern the use of SAEVs, including safety standards, liability issues, and privacy concerns. Local and national governments must also coordinate to ensure consistent regulations across different regions and jurisdictions. SAEVs have the potential to complement existing public TN, but this requires careful planning and coordination. This includes developing systems for integrating SAEVs with buses, trains, and other modes of public transit and ensuring that SAEVs are accessible and affordable for all community members. Effective data management is critical for ensuring the safety and efficiency of SAEVs, as they generate vast amounts of data, including information about traffic patterns, vehicle performance, and passenger behaviour. Managing this data effectively can optimize PN
and TN more broadly. Since SAEVs rely on electric power, they require significant energy [23]. This raises concerns about energy consumption, storage, and the environmental impact of generating electricity.

Addressing these concerns will require developing more efficient and sustainable methods for generating and storing electricity and optimizing the use of existing power grids. The successful integration of SAEVs into TN and PN will require a coordinated effort across multiple sectors and stakeholders. While there are challenges to overcome, the potential benefits of SAEVs make this effort worthwhile. It is essential to ensure that SAEVs are safe, accessible, and sustainable for everyone in the community. From the above-discussed challenges, in this article, the integration of SAEVs into TN and PN are discussed with detailed taxonomy, several research works, comparisons, research gaps, and challenges.

The previous research on SAEV operation integrated either in PN
[24] or TN [24,25], carbon footprints [23], sustainable cities [26] and optimization has been limited and not extended to coupled power, and transportation networks (CPTN). This is a significant gap, as CPTN
design planning is critical for infrastructure development and interdependency. Previous studies on the role of SAEV in PN or TN focused on individual users rather than considering the interconnected nature of these networks. Recently, there has been a surge in the publication of research studies on SAEV. Therefore, adopting a holistic approach to consolidate the current knowledge base is crucial. Some of the review work includes morning commutes with endogenous shared autonomous vehicle [27], transportation systems management considering dynamic wireless charging [28,29], logistics and transport [30],
and blockchain in the autonomous vehicle supply chain [31]. Cybersecurity for SAEV [32]. However, they do not discuss the taxonomy and interdependency of CPTN in the context of SAEV. Table 1 **highlights the**
existing literature review articles on SAEV with critical criteria compared with the study reported in this article. Therefore, this paper aims to suggest the concept of SAEV to both the PN and TN communities to encourage collaboration and the creation of a correlation between these coupled problems. By doing so, the potential benefits and challenges of SAEV in the context of CPTN would be better understood, and more effective strategies to improve the overall performance which helps in the development of critical infrastructure systems.

The exploration of SAEVs within the framework of CPTN is of considerable significance for the prospective evolution of urban mobility and sustainability. The integration of SAEV with a CPTN holds the promise of advancing energy sustainability. This synergy enables optimized energy consumption through effective routing algorithms [33], dynamic charging infrastructure, grid services [34], last mile services [35] contributing to reduced environmental impact and enhanced overall energy conservation. Additionally, the integration of SAEV with a CPTN presents a paradigm shift towards environmental protection. By reducing emissions with minimum conventional vehicles and through electrification [36] adding more renewable energy sources [37], this synergy not only mitigates air pollution but also nurtures sustainable practices, contributing to a healthier and greener urban environment.

By conducting sensitivity analysis, the researchers determine the optimal battery size and the number of charging stations to minimize costs.

The findings in [38] suggest that vehicles with a range of 50–90 miles and 66 chargers per square mile (25 per square km), equipped with an 11 kW connection, can offer services at a cost ranging from $0.29 to $0.61 per mile ($0.18–$0.38 per km). This cost is approximately 10 times lower than that of conventional taxis and is even more economical than services provided by non-electric vehicles. Additionally, the researchers estimate that SAEVs could lead to a 73% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to current taxis, given the current power grid, owing to increased vehicle efficiency. Autonomous driving has the R. Sumitkumar and A.S. Al-Sumaiti potential to generate revenue ranging from $300 billion to $400 billion by 2035, according to recent research that unveils the essential factors for success in the rapidly evolving passenger car market [39]. Within the interconnected landscape of CPTN, surrounding both power grids and transportation networks, a comprehensive understanding of SAEV dynamics becomes imperative. A critical analysis of their influence on power grid reliability, load distribution, and charging infrastructure emerges as crucial for the seamless integration of SAEVs into existing urban frameworks. The research findings have the potential to offer valuable insights into the optimization of charging strategies, alleviation of traffic congestion, and the advancement of sustainable urban practices. In the ongoing shift towards intelligent and interconnected urban systems, the investigation into SAEVs within CPTN serves as a guiding framework for the establishment of efficient, dependable, and environmentally conscious urban transportation networks. The study in [40] employs a comprehensive agent-based model to analyse SAEV fleet management dynamics, considering factors like battery range and charging infrastructure. Results reveal that SAEVs can efficiently replace privately owned vehicles, with charging infrastructure optimization and financial viability, making them competitive and environmentally friendly in urban transportation scenarios, showcasing their potential mode share ranging from 14 to 39%. Through an agentbased simulation in [41] across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area, the study reveals the strong correlation between SAEV performance and charging infrastructure, highlighting the importance of faster-charging facilities, strategic placement-based on demand hubs, and careful battery capacity selection. The results emphasize the positive influence of battery-swapping infrastructure on enhancing SAEV
service performance, providing valuable insights for the future development of SAEV mobility systems. Another study in [42] mentioned the potential of SAEV, revealing that a fleet comprising only 10%– 14% of private vehicles can deliver comparable transport services in Tokyo. The research employs a simulation methodology, assessing the influence of fleet size on service quality and break-even prices.

Additionally, the system's capability to supply operating reserve during grid operator requests is demonstrated, highlighting the efficiency and resilience of SAEV systems under various operational conditions. The survey conducted in [43] for Brisbane, Australia, reveals an openness to change, with cost being a key determinant, influencing preferences for SEAVs and highlighting demographic factors impacting acceptance, such as wealth, commuting status, and lifestyle preferences. Another study in [44] examines the potential benefits of a SAEV by addressing the last mile service in public transit between Ann Arbor and Detroit Wayne County Airport. Analysing environmental, cost, and performance metrics, the research suggests that integrating SAEV for last-mile transit services could enhance sustainability by promoting a mode shift from private to public transit options, with energy savings of up to 37% compared to personal vehicle options in the case study.

The integrated analysis of vehicle electrification conducted in [9–45],
reveals that widespread electrification, coupled with automation and shared mobility, could lead to substantial reductions in petroleum consumption and CO2 emissions, resulting in significant health benefits and emphasizing the importance of policies to promote the transition to SAEV.

## 2. Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicle

The automotive industry is evolving rapidly, driven by technological advances, new mobility service models, and the adoption of connected services, autonomous vehicles, shared mobility, and electrification technologies. This transformation is causing manufacturers and industry players to struggle to plan for the scale of change required in their business models. However, OEMs can offer customers more personalized, convenient, and transparent sales and maintenance journeys through advanced technology and connected vehicle data. The benefits of integration of SAEV are numerous and include, 1. **Reduced Traffic Congestion and Improved Air Quality: SAEV**
with connected features can alleviate traffic congestion by optimizing routes and minimizing the number of vehicles on the road. Additionally, their reliance on EV technology, which produces zero emissions, contributes to improved air quality in urban areas, positively impacting public health.

2. **Electricity Market Engagement of SAEV: SAEV equipped with**
ample battery capacity can actively participate in the electricity market through diverse mechanisms. This involvement includes offering services with bidirectional power flow, providing grid support during peak load periods, enhancing grid flexibility, integrating renewable energy sources, and incorporating specific revenue models.

3. **Load Balancing and Demand Response: SAEVs, through efficient**
coordination and integration into demand response programs, play a pivotal role in load balancing on the power network. Their intelligent scheduling of charging times and locations, along with the ability to adjust charging schedules based on grid needs, helps distribute the electrical load evenly and supports grid stability by mitigating strain during peak demand or supply fluctuations.

4. **Accessibility and Cost Savings: SAEV offers increased accessibility, providing transportation options for individuals who may**

Furthermore, SAEVs can optimize routes and minimize the time spent searching for parking, offering users a convenient and safer transportation solution.

6. **Power Curtailment: SAEV can play a crucial role in mitigating**
issues associated with power curtailment in the electric grid when effectively coordinated and coupled in CPTN, particularly in regions with abundant renewable energy sources.

SAEV also referred to as a CASE vehicle, is part of the CASE
initiative taken up by OEMs such as Toyota, Mercedes, Nissan, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Tata, etc., for future mobility and fight against climate change [46]. Similar CASE projects like connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) and shared autonomous vehicles (SAV) are also research areas focused on by certain OEMs. Fig. 2 **illustrates the**
different features of the CASE vehicle, and details are highlighted in the below paragraphs. Table **2. compares the available vehicles in the** market with key criteria comparison of autonomous, shared, electric, and connected. Autonomous vehicles can sense their environment and operate without human involvement, with Waymo One and Easymile EZ10 being fully autonomous at Level 4/5. Shared vehicles, such as Waymo One and BlueSG, can be rented or shared by multiple users, reducing the need for individual ownership. Electric vehicles, such as the Tesla Model S, and Renault Zoe, are powered by electricity and produce zero emissions, making them environmentally friendly. All vehicles in the table are connected, allowing for features such as real-time traffic information and remote diagnostics. Fig. 3 **shows the** features and highlights of SAEV.

may seem futuristic, many cars today have internet connectivity. For instance, Waze has partnered with ExxonMobil and Shell to provide contactless fuel payments, and Google Maps allows drivers in Austin, Texas, to pay for parking using Google Pay [47]. CV provides numerous benefits, including enhanced driver safety, time savings, and reduced emissions. Additionally, these vehicles offer customers personalized, convenient, and transparent sales and maintenance journeys. By incorporating connected features and data into infotainment systems, fully autonomous driving may be possible. Shared ownership is made less complex with connected functionality, and personal virtual assistants offer on-demand support [48]. To generate profit and improve customer experiences, traditional manufacturers must integrate dealer and OEM processes and employ a highly skilled workforce capable of interpreting data. Tesla, a brand that prioritizes data visibility and consumer needs, leads the industry in this regard. The below paragraph highlights the available literature on connected vehicles.

According to the study in [49] security and privacy of data associated with CV technology significantly influence trust, attitude, behavioural intention to use, and perceived usefulness. This research also examined respondents' socio-demographic and other characteristics linked to CV acceptance and its predictors, with implications of both theoretical and practical applications in the industry. Another article [50] emphasizes the importance of testing CV technology and developing a test platform based on a driving simulator to evaluate the impact of CV technology on safety features and driving behaviour in various scenarios such as fog, tunnel, and work zones. The results indicate that CV technology positively enhances safety and driving

behaviour, and the test platform can serve as a reference for researchers in related fields. Finally, the article [51] explores the development of lane change (LC) detection and prediction models using real-world data collected by CVs. The study leverages an auto-encoder for LC detection and a transformer-based model for LC prediction, outperforming conventional methods in accuracy and computational efficiency. The findings suggest that LC can be accurately predicted up to two seconds in advance, and the transformer model holds practical application potential. Overall, these studies provide important insights into CV technology's use, testing, and development. The study in [52] applied a deep reinforcement learning approach for vehicle lane change decisions to provide autonomy to the vehicle. However, most of the literature failed to address the issue of data privacy, cyber-attacks, and safetyrelated issues. The research in [53] introduces a novel energy-efficient autonomous driving strategy for EVs that optimizes energy consumption by considering both lane-change and car-following behaviours, utilizing deep reinforcement learning, and incorporating a rule-based safety checker, resulting in significant energy savings in dynamic traffic scenarios while maintaining safety and traffic efficiency.

## 2.2. Autonomous Vehicle

According to a survey [54], 34% of consumers believe vehicles will become fully autonomous by 2030. Last year, companies such as NVIDIA, Audi, Ford, BMW, and Tesla launched full AV. These vehicles use sensor technology and create a virtual environment by image processing to detect and identify obstacles and objects on the road and advanced control systems to interpret the sensory information and execute the movement. The Society of Automotive Engineers
(SAE International) created a vehicle automation classification system outlining five levels of driving automation. These levels, ranging from zero to five, describe the degree of automation and human involvement required in the driving process. Level zero (L0) is no automation, while level one (L1) involves driver assistance. Level two (L2) entails partial automation, while level three (L3) involves conditional automation.

Level four (L4) pertains to high automation, and level five (L5) represents full automation, where no human interaction is required at all [55]. This classification system provides a clear understanding of the degree of automation and human involvement associated with different levels of driving.

Autonomous features such as forward collision warning and auto brake can make the vehicle more receptive and safe to drive, resulting in fewer collisions and insurance claims involving injury. However, there are flaws in some business cases, such as the vulnerability of autonomous vehicles to criminal targeting due to their automatic braking features. The capacity of autonomous vehicles to navigate and make decisions in unforeseen circumstances is restricted, and it is extremely difficult to program intuition-based decision-making into them. Nonetheless, established industry leaders like Tesla, Amazon, and Google are currently in the preliminary stages of autonomous driving research. Conventional automotive manufacturers are integrating more sophisticated features into their current vehicles [54]. The following paragraph outlines significant sources of information related to autonomous technology.

Ref. [56] presented a study that analysed 10,374 AV-related comments from a micro-blogging website. Results indicate that users' sentiments depend on AVs safety and convenience and their impact on society, such as unemployment. Computer vision is a widely used approach to detect road boundaries and lanes through a vehicle's vision system. This technology involves utilizing a camera mounted on the vehicle to capture the front view and then implementing various algorithms to identify lanes and objects. The algorithm for detecting lane marks and objects can be customized to suit specific needs. The author of article [57] discusses the development of a cooperative controller for autonomous vehicles that utilize the entire road width without detecting lanes. The controller employs a nonlinear model predictive control

![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)

strategy to manage multiple self-driving vehicles, ensuring optimal progress on the road with minimal control efforts while meeting design constraints. According to simulation results, the proposed lane-free approach can enhance traffic flow performance compared to conventional lane-based roadways, reducing passenger travel time, lowering energy consumption, and increasing road capacity, depending on road density and track layout. Ref. [58] targeted the development of a real-time obstacle avoidance system for the autonomous navigation of unmanned ground vehicles. The system utilizes sequential RGB data with training conducted using a simulator. It shows promising results for future implementation in a real-world prototype. The study in [59] suggests a predictive trajectory planning framework for autonomous vehicles utilizing a partially observable Markov decision process (MDP) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate safe, comfortable, and energy-efficient trajectories. Additionally, Ref. [60] comprehensively examines misbehaviour detection in CAV, starting with a new definition of misbehaviour. It examines state-of-the-art solutions, provides a detailed taxonomy of machine learning algorithms, and reviews available tools and data sets. CAVs are an emerging technology that is transforming the transportation industry worldwide. As of 2023, several CAVs are available globally, each with unique features and capabilities. It is worth noting that while some CAVs are fully autonomous, others still require human intervention in certain situations. Also, the availability and use of CAVs vary by region and country, depending on local regulations and infrastructure.

## 2.3. Shared Vehicle

According to a recent survey [61], 66% of respondents believe that the most significant advantage of a future with autonomous ondemand vehicles is the financial savings associated with not owning a car. Shared electric vehicles (SEVs) play a significant role in the social economy by promoting sustainability, reducing carbon emissions, and improving energy efficiency. Shared EV services provide an affordable and environmentally friendly transportation option, increasing accessibility for individuals who may not have the means to afford private electric vehicles. By encouraging the adoption of electric mobility, shared EVs contribute to reducing GHG emissions, which improves air quality and helps mitigate the impacts of climate change. Additionally, shared EV platforms often incorporate smart charging infrastructure, enabling the optimal utilization of renewable energy sources and reducing strain on the electric grid. These services also contribute to job creation within the electric vehicle industry and drive technological advancements. Embracing shared electric vehicles supports a greener and more sustainable social economy, promoting environmental stewardship and facilitating the transition towards a low-carbon future. The sharing and subscription models are becoming increasingly popular, with OEMs positioning themselves as fleet owners. However, balancing profitability in a changing marketplace will be a significant challenge for OEMs. Mobility-sharing services include public transit, micro-mobility [62], car-based modes, bikesharing, and ride-sharing, with brands like Lyft, Uber, Bird, Scoop, and Moovit leading the way. The focused research area in different articles is autonomous mobility on demand (AMoD) [63], ride-hailing service (RHS) [64], ride-sharing [65], dial-a-ride (DaR) [66], etc. The following paragraph highlights literature available in shared vehicles with autonomous/connected under ICE and EV segments.

The article [67] discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks of autonomous and electric vehicles and how shared mobility systems could help alleviate costs. The study proposes a fleet optimization multi-class user problem considering AVs and EVs in private and shared mobility systems, using meta-heuristic algorithms to solve the complex optimization problem. Results from a case study in Ann Arbor, Michigan, highlight the trade-offs in implementing these technologies and provide valuable insights for planning. The author in [68] presents a dynamic ride-hailing sharing problem with the heterogeneous vehicle and users' category, and classifying ride-hailing vehicles as express and premier types.

of their time on-site, and vehicles are often idle. The study [70] investigates the factors that affect public trust and acceptance of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs), including autonomy level, anthropomorphic characteristics, and human-related, environmental, and societal factors. The results show that autonomy level and anthropomorphic characteristics indirectly increase public acceptance via trust, while other factors also positively contribute to public acceptance. The study also suggests incorporating anthropomorphic features and a relatively high autonomy level in SAVs to build public trust and acceptance.

## 2.4. Electric Vehicle

EVs have gained significant attention in recent years as a promising solution for reducing GHG emissions from transportation. Unlike traditional gasoline-powered cars, EVs are powered by electric motors and rechargeable batteries, offering several benefits, including zero tailpipe emissions, improved energy efficiency, and lower fuel costs [71]. Moreover, as RES [71], such as solar and wind power, become more prevalent, EVs can be charged using clean energy, reducing their environmental impact. While there are still challenges to overcome, such as the availability of charging infrastructure and the high cost of batteries, the rapid technological advances and the growing demand for sustainable transportation options suggest that EVs will play an increasingly important role in future mobility. Apart from pure EVs, the trend of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) to overcome the range anxiety issue of owners is also gaining more popularity. HEVs include a gasoline-based powertrain and an electric motor powertrain to produce the required tractive force. OEMs are giving other attention to the manufacturing of hydrogen [72] or fuel cell-based vehicles known as FCEVs, where hydrogen is the primary source utilized. Fuel cells convert hydrogen into electricity, later stored in batteries to power the electric motor. Another vehicle category is based on ultra-capacitor (UC) applications, also known as super-capacitors. UCs, having high power and longer life features, are suitable for EV applications [71]. Numerous research works have been carried out in the direction of EV
design and development, charging management [73], energy management, charging cost minimization [62], planning problems, RES and EV behaviour in the grid [74,75], integration, and user acceptance. The research on SAEV is similar to the above-mentioned EV-related research; however, some of its characteristics make it different and require an evolution from the implementation point of view. The research paper [76] presents a cloud-based multi-objective energy management strategy for hybrid battery systems in electric vehicles, enhancing safety and efficiency while reducing energy loss and aging costs, validated through real-world data and processor-in-the-loop tests, outperforming existing learning-based strategies.

## 3.1. Vehicle Routing Problem

The VRP has numerous applications in diverse industries, including logistics, transportation, waste management, and delivery services. The capacitated VRP, or the classical VRP, aims to find optimal delivery routes for vehicles with identical characteristics and a single central depot. The goal is to minimize costs while ensuring that each customer is visited once by a vehicle and that the capacity of each vehicle is not exceeded. Over time, researchers have introduced additional reallife aspects and characteristics to extend this problem, resulting in several VRP variants [77]. For example, the heterogeneous fleet VRP (HFVRP) [78] varies in capacities, while the VRP with time windows (VRPTW) requires [79] deliveries to be made within specific intervals. Fig. 4 **illustrates the key tasks under the VRP approach. In the VRP with**
pickup and delivery (VRPPD) [80], goods are picked up and dropped off by the same vehicle, so both locations must be included in the same route. This problem is typically presented as a mathematical model, and many algorithms, such as exact algorithms [81], heuristics, and metaheuristics [82], have been devised to tackle it. Tackling the VRP holds the potential for substantial cost reductions, heightened operational efficiency, and diminished environmental footprint. The incorporation of SAEV scheduling into VRP necessitates minimal adjustments, encompassing the integration of charging stations, pause duration, recharging intervals, vehicle-specific energy consumption, charger ratings, capacity considerations, and relocation strategies, among others. **Table** 3 compares literature work on considering modified VRP's taxonomy.

## 3.2. Trip Order Assignment

The operational research problem of dial-a-ride, ride-hailing services, carpooling, and taxi booking relies on the trip order assignment problem [15]. Efficiently assigning incoming trip requests to available drivers (or AV) while minimizing waiting times for passengers and maximizing completed trips is the main objective of the trip order assignment problem faced by ride-hailing services. However, this is a complex task as it involves considering multiple factors, including drivers (or AV) proximity to passengers, estimated time for trip completion, driver availability, and passenger preferences [92].

The assignment of trip orders to vehicles is a crucial component of solving the VRP with added constraints and factors. This process involves considering multiple factors, such as the distance to be travelled, the time required to complete the trip, the number of stops, and the priority of the trip. The primary objective is to minimize the total

distance travelled by all vehicles while ensuring that each trip is completed within the given time frame. There are two main approaches to assigning trips: heuristic methods [93], such as the nearest neighbour or farthest insertion method, and mathematical programming techniques, such as integer linear programming (ILP) [94]. While ILP guarantees an optimal solution, it can be computationally demanding for large-scale problems. Hence, finding a balance between computational complexity and solution quality is necessary. Dynamic programming, agent-based simulation models, and machine learning approaches are also applied in dial-a-ride problems while keeping trip order assignment objectives.

The conventional VRP considering trip order assignment problem differs slightly from the SAEV vehicle scheduling problem. The additional constraints of battery specification, charging time, and specific power consumption of vehicles also need to be considered.

## 3.3. Parking And Recharging Time

The conventional VPR problem considers the one or multiple depots where vehicles will be parked along with finding the optimal routes [95]. The problem for SAEV, AEV, or SEV involves planning routes and recharging time, which is a crucial consideration in solving redEV routing problems (EVRP) apart from parking problems [77]. In EVRP, EVs must be recharged before continuing their journey once they reach a certain threshold value of a state of charge (SoC). The time required for recharging depends on several factors such as the battery capacity, charging rate of a battery, charger rating, and SoC at the start of the charging [96]. Consequently, the time spent on recharging can significantly impact the vehicle's schedule. Parking time must also be considered, as EVs must park while recharging. Factors affecting parking time include charging stations' availability [91] and the number of vehicles waiting to recharge [97]. Therefore, optimizing parking and recharging time is critical to ensure EVs efficient and effective operation [98].

## 3.4. Vehicle Re-Balancing

Vehicle re-balancing, or redistribution/repositioning, is a critical aspect of user request-based services such as dial-a-ride, ride-hailing services, and public transport [99]. In such a research area, there is a need to re-balance vehicles to ensure sufficient vehicles are available at each location to meet the demand [100]. Vehicle re-balancing involves moving vehicles from where they are plentiful to where they are scarce [101]. By doing so, the problem of the under-utilization of vehicles can be avoided. Compared with ICE vehicles, the EVs in ridehailing services create complexity and constraints. The re-balancing involves moving a vehicle from one node to another subjected to power consumption by the vehicle and reduction in SoC [102]. Addressing the intricacies of vehicle re-balancing presents challenges owing to the unpredictable nature of demand and charging patterns. However, diverse methods exist to optimize this process. Notably, the application of data analytics, as in [103], and machine learning algorithms, as explored in [85], proves instrumental in accurately predicting demand and charging patterns. The effective implementation of vehicle re-balancing is pivotal to the success of SAEV, as it plays a key role in maintaining a balance between the demand for EVs and their availability at each location [104].

3.5. Depots, origin, and destination Another problem in transportation operational research is the origin and destination of users, also known as the pick-up and drop, which are critical factors when planning routes [105]. The depot serves as the starting and ending point for each vehicle's route, and it is also where the vehicles are parked when not in use [106]. In the case of SAEV,
the depots serve as charging stations where idle vehicles are kept in parking and charging [107]. Consequently, the placement of the depot plays a pivotal role in determining the solution to the problem. For example, when the depot is situated considerably from the demand locations, it can result in extended travel times, heightened energy consumption, and elevated costs. Hence, the strategic selection of an optimal depot location is imperative to guarantee the efficient and effective operation of EVs. Moreover, the EVRP introduces additional complexity by allowing multiple depots. This further complicates the problem, underscoring the importance of judiciously determining the number and locations of depots. This decision is critical in adequately meeting demand while simultaneously minimizing the overall cost of the system. Routing the SAEV vehicle with a specific capacity with multiple pick-up points [108] based on the user's request and drop-off points may further complicate the problem.

## 3.6. User Requests And Capacity Flow

Compared with conventional VRP problems [109], user requests and capacity flow heavily influence SAEV vehicles in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. User requests pertain to the distribution and number of trip requests made by passengers. At the same time, capacity flow refers to the SAEV system's ability to meet such requests via vehicle allocation and scheduling [104]. Efficient allocation and scheduling algorithms must be developed and implemented to minimize waiting times, travel distances, and energy consumption. This involves optimizing vehicle routing, charging schedules, and vehicle allocation using sophisticated algorithms [17]. Additionally, real-time data on user requests and vehicle availability must be monitored and analysed to adjust the SAEV system's capacity flow and meet users' needs. Addressing these challenges can lead to reliable, sustainable, and efficient transportation through SAEV vehicles, benefiting users and society.

## 4. Saev In Power Network

SAEV has emerged as a promising solution to curb the carbon footprint of transportation and enhance urban mobility. Besides their potential benefits in reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality, SAEV can contribute to electrical PN [110]. As the prevalence of EVs increases, it is essential to charge them efficiently and avoid overloading the power grid. Coordinating the charging schedules and reducing the peak load on the grid by using SAEV can optimize power consumption. This way, SAEV can facilitate a more efficient and sustainable electrical PN that promotes the widespread adoption of EV [111]. Nevertheless, implementing SAEV in the PN requires careful planning and coordination between the transportation and energy sectors to ensure the infrastructure can support this emerging technology.

Fig. 5. **SAEV in power network: Modified IEEE 33 bus RDS.**
Fig. 5 **illustrates the modified IEEE 33 bus radial distribution system** with charging and battery swapping stations, highlighting electricity price, base load, charging power demand, and PV power generation.

Table 4 **compares the research article carried out work on SAEV, EV,** AEV, and SAV while considering power network, network constraint, and related parameters. Integrating SAEV vehicles into the PN raises several questions, including the location of charging stations, waiting times, charger ratings, electricity prices [112], and more. Researchers have conducted numerous studies on electric vehicle charging problems [38] and scheduling, considering the electrical PN and associated constraints. Although the problem of scheduling SAEV vehicles for charging is similar to scheduling EVs, factors such as waiting times, charging costs, and re-balancing costs are crucial considerations. The following subsections focus on literature examining the challenges associated with SAEV in the PN.

## 4.1. Electricity Price

The behaviour of SAEV in PN is significantly influenced by the cost of electricity. Elevated electricity prices are anticipated to result in decreased demand for charging services, leading to reduced utilization of charging infrastructure, increased transportation costs for users, or diminished profits for operators. These shifts have consequential implications for the reliability and stability of the power grid, as well as the economic feasibility of investments in charging infrastructure. The yearly electricity expenses for the EV and AEV
were computed based on factors such as daily operational hours, vehicle electricity consumption, charging station efficiency, and electricity prices [113]. Additionally, the introduction of RES into the power grid adds further complexity to the relationship between electricity prices and charging behaviour. The availability of renewable energy is subject to variations based on weather patterns and other factors [114]. This complexity underscores the significance of uncertainties in electricity generation, charging power demand, and human behaviour towards adopting SAEV. Ref. [115] performed a Puget Sound case study through agent-based simulation, the study evaluates the benefits of active SAEV
charging management, emphasizing the role of battery capacity, charging infrastructure, and renewable energy sources in optimizing performance, reducing costs, and enhancing system efficiency. Results underscore the potential of strategic charging to mitigate peak demand and lower overall energy-related expenses, particularly in scenarios with larger battery sizes and real-time pricing structures. The author in [116] proposes a dedicated EV mobility model for an SV to optimize charging schedules and pricing strategies to maximize profit while participating in a distribution power market, showcasing the potential of shared EVs to reshape load profiles and contribute to environmental sustainability without compromising company profitability. The research in [38] introduces a methodology for optimizing the charging of SAEV through V2G technology, concurrently optimizing routing and relocation. The proposed model, demonstrated in a Tokyo case study, efficiently reduces charging costs without a significant impact on waiting times, highlighting the potential for substantial savings with increased electricity price variability.

## 4.2. Infrastructure And Optimal Location Of Cs

The emergence of SAEVs signifies a fundamental transformation in conventional transportation methods, exerting an influence on passenger distribution across diverse routes and reshaping the dynamics of travel demand. In parallel, the incorporation of effective charging infrastructure becomes paramount to sustain the widespread acceptance of electric vehicles within the CPTN, ensuring smooth operations and minimizing environmental impact. Furthermore, the interaction between SAEVs and the existing transportation framework demands a thorough examination of how these autonomous electric vehicles can either complement, supplement, or potentially replace traditional modes of public transportation. A comprehensive analysis of these implications not only illuminates the potential advantages and challenges but also underscores the need for optimizations to harness SAEVs for the advancement of the CPTN. To ascertain the optimal location for a SAEV charging station within the PN, a comprehensive analysis of various factors becomes imperative. This assessment encompasses considerations such as charging demand, power availability, proximity to major transportation hubs and popular destinations, as well as the potential impact on surrounding infrastructure and the environment. Through this thorough examination, the goal is to identify the ideal location that ensures efficient and reliable charging of SAEVs while minimizing any adverse effects on the TN and power grid.

Ref. [13] contributes to this field by presenting an optimization model designed for planning the deployment of charging facilities within a SAEV. The model takes into account demand uncertainty and optimizes both long-term planning decisions, such as charging facility sizing and configuration, and short-term operational decisions, including vehicle assignment, relocation, and charging strategies. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through testing in Shanghai on a largescale case study. The results indicate that deploying both normaland fast-charging infrastructure not only enhances the system's profitability but also improves its overall operational performance. The study in [120] introduces a framework to optimize charging infrastructure development, considering interactions between shared mobility, autonomous driving, and electrification, and evaluates optimal configurations for EV adoption in New York City taxis, revealing that future fleets with full EV adoption benefit from more scattered charging stations, reducing CO2 emissions significantly. The study in [119] presents a charging system planning framework for an AEV ride-hailing fleet in urban areas, utilizing the BEAM agent-based simulation model to assess R. Sumitkumar and A.S.

complex passenger and transportation behaviours, identifying charging demands and optimizing charging station placement and sizing for economic and carbon emission impacts in the San Francisco Bay Area. Ref. [124] introduces a hybrid simulation–optimization model for siting and sizing cost-effective charging infrastructure for SAEVs, utilizing real-world trip data from ShareNow in Berlin to assess the impact of charging strategies and fleet size on charging patterns, required number of chargers, and fleet performance, emphasizing the importance of considering the spatial distribution of installation costs and charging demands in urban mobility transformations.

## 4.3. Charging Time

Integrating SAEVs into the PN is heavily influenced by their charging time, which is critical in their utilization. The charging time of SAEVs affects the power demand on the grid and the availability of vehicles for service, which can affect user satisfaction. Therefore, the charging infrastructure must be designed to efficiently charge a large number of SAEVs while ensuring their availability for service and minimizing their impact on the power grid. However, fast charging of SAEVs can create additional strain on the power grid and slow power charging can affect the waiting time for users, cost, and supply–demand issues of SAEVs. Ref. [125] proposes a closed queuing network model to optimize the performance of EV sharing systems by computing the optimal fleet size and number of chargers in each neighbourhood. The profit is concave concerning fleet size and the number of chargers, and installing more chargers can reduce fleet size and increase the availability of vehicles. The simulation shows that two slow chargers may perform better than one fast charger when the variance of charging time is relatively large. Reference in [126] examines the benefits of coupling charging and repositioning events in on-demand SAEV services to improve service quality, reduce empty travel, and enhance fleet utilization. The study used an agent-based model and found that coupling charging and repositioning events lowered rider's waiting times, increased daily trips per SAEV, and reduced empty travel. Ref.

Al-Sumaiti in on-demand SAEV services to improve service quality, reduce empty travel, and enhance fleet utilization. The study used an agent-based model and found that coupling charging and repositioning events lowered rider's waiting times, increased daily trips per SAEV, and reduced empty travel. Ref. [127] proposes a parallel mobile charging service to charge SEVs at their parking spots, instead of relocating them to charging stations. The proposed approach optimizes mobile charging vehicle routes using a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model and takes advantage of SEV clusters and mobile charging to simultaneously charge multiple SEVs. An adaptive large neighbourhood search algorithm is developed to solve large-scale instances, and the clusterbased parallel acceleration time ratio is introduced to demonstrate the advantages of parallel services in utilizing overlapping time windows.

## 4.4. Battery Swapping Station (Bss) 11

The earlier subsection discussed how the charging time affects the supply–demand of SAEV to users, specifically during peak hours. BSS
involves the replacement of depleted batteries with fully charged ones, facilitating a rapid replenishment process that reduces downtime and increases the availability of vehicles for the provision of ancillary services [128]. Additionally, using RES to charge the batteries at BSS
can further minimize the carbon footprint of SAEVs. However, deploying BSS involves a significant investment in infrastructure, and standardizing the battery packs while swapping procedures remains challenging.

Ref. [129] presents a combined operation for BSS and AMoD service, using an expanded network flow model to optimize swapping scheduling and vehicle re-balancing for EV fleets. Simulation experiments based on real-world data from New York City (NYC) demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed integrated operation model. Ref. [41] proposes a periodic fluid model to optimize battery purchasing and charging policy at a BSS facing time-varying demand and prices, balancing battery investment and operating, including charging cost and customer waiting cost. The optimization problem involves identifying an optimal amount of battery fluid and determining an optimal charging rule using Pontryagin's maximum principle. The combined effect of demand patterns and electricity prices on battery investment decisions is quantified. Ref. [130] proposes a bi-level optimization model that considers the interaction between BSS and AMoD systems, focusing on optimizing the quality-of-service aware battery swapping price. The upper level optimizes swapping pricing to reflect battery inventory. In contrast, the lower level proposes a unified network flow model to characterize the operational decision of the AMoD fleet, with an iteration-based algorithm used to attain results. Real-world data from NYC Taxi were used to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm. In [131] an innovative online state monitoring method based on transferred multi-task learning is proposed in this paper, utilizing convolutional neural networks for information sharing and task-specific layers to enhance state/temperature monitoring accuracy, with comprehensive experiments showcasing its effectiveness, including applications under extreme conditions and retired electric vehicle batteries.

## 4.5. Ancillary Services

The emergence of SAEVs has the potential to bring about significant changes in the transportation sector and offer a unique chance to enhance the stability and reliability of the power grid through the provision of ancillary services. Ancillary services, which include frequency regulation, voltage control, and reactive power support, play a critical role in balancing electricity generation and consumption. SAEV
batteries act as energy storage devices to deliver ancillary services, which can reduce the need for traditional power plants to provide these services. However, integrating SAEVs into the power grid as a source of ancillary services poses several technical, economic, and regulatory challenges that must be addressed. The ancillary services are studied in [42] using a simulation methodology to evaluate SAEV,
and charge scheduling based on the dedicated charging stations for each participant using a heuristic approach. The impact of large number of vehicles in terms of the quality of transportation services and break-even prices. Ref. [132] presents a system-level design for providing ancillary services for electric power grids by in-vehicle batteries, specifically EVs, in a sharing service. The design uses an autonomous vehicle-to-grid (V2G) architecture based on the physics-based model to regulate the impact of EV charging/discharging on the grid. It is evaluated with numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop tests.

Ref. [133] proposes a mixed integer linear programming model to optimize EV management in a one-way car-sharing system integrated with V2G technology, aiming to maximize revenue from system users and V2G profits. To avoid the disruption of transportation services, the use of BSS can minimize waiting time [134], charging time, and charging. At the same time, the BSS can serve as an ancillary service provider by utilizing the spare batteries kept in charge.

## 5. Saev In Transportation Network

In the TN, multiple studies were conducted on AV, EV, SAV, dial-aride problems, public transportation systems, etc. However, the problem for SAEV is slightly different due to the inclusion of constraints and the nature of EV. The dial-a-ride problem refers to the mathematical optimization problem of deciding a set of vehicle routes to serve pick-up and drop-off requests. This problem is complex due to the many possible routes and the need to optimize for multiple factors such as vehicle capacity, travel time, and operating costs. However, advances in machine learning and optimization algorithms have led to the development of more efficient and effective solutions to this problem, which can help improve the reliability and accessibility of the first and last-mile services in ride-hailing and other transportation systems. First and last-mile service in ride-hailing or dial-a-ride problems refers to the challenge of providing transportation options that connect passengers from their origin to the ride-hailing pick-up point and from the ride-hailing drop-off point to their final destination. This issue is particularly prevalent in urban areas, where passengers may need to travel long distances to reach public transportation or where certain areas may be inaccessible by public transportation altogether.

As a result, the first and last-mile services play critical roles in providing affordable and efficient transportation solutions to urban residents. The study in [87] highlights the potential benefits of emerging mobility services like ride-hailing and SAV in improving transportation system efficiency and reducing environmental costs, specifically in the firstmile last-mile services. However, the study also reveals the need for strategic deployment, intelligent management of these technologies, and current limitations in SAEV technology for widespread deployment in real-world systems. Improving battery range and travel speed beyond a certain threshold could outperform driver-based shuttle solutions.

with SAEV charging stations and wind power sources. Table 5 **compares**
the literature work carried out on SAEV, EV, ICE, etc., on specific TN, constraints, and solution approaches used.

## 5.1. Traffic Congestion

It is stated in Section 1 **that SAEV is a form of shared transportation**
that reduces the number of vehicles on the road, and hence less traffic is experienced during peak hours. Moreover, SAEVs can be programmed to optimize routes and avoid congested areas, reducing traffic. However, the success of SAEVs in reducing traffic congestion also depends on their adoption rate and integration into the TN. Without widespread adoption and proper infrastructure, SAEVs may not have the desired impact on reducing traffic congestion. The research paper [135] proposes a network design model for optimizing the government lane

expansion scheme for EV TN. The model considers the charging time, range anxiety, and uncertain transportation demand while aiming to minimize the total travel time of drivers and optimize the lane expansion scheme under an investment ceiling. The proposed algorithm based on the active set algorithm and column generation effectively solves the model, and sensitivity analysis is carried out for different investment levels and control parameters.

The research paper [136] proposes an integrated framework that addresses the charging and route selection strategies for SAEVs to cope with the problem of urban traffic congestion. The proposed algorithms effectively divert traffic to roads with less vehicle volume and reduce passengers' travel time by 28% during peak hours, providing a solution to prevent urban traffic congestion and shorten the travel times of EV
passengers. The research paper [137] examines the impact of SAVs on a city-size traffic system using traffic flow theory, simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment, and a computer experiment. The simulation results indicate that implementing SAV positively affects traffic performance, and an increase in the SAV demand share leads to an overall improvement in the network performance (see Table 5).

## 5.2. Waiting Time, Users' Satisfaction And Cost

SAEV adoption has the potential to have a favourable impact on costs, customer satisfaction, and waiting times in TN. According to the following research, SAEVs can shorten travel times by optimal routing and ease traffic. This reduces waiting times. Also, SAEVs offer a practical and cost-effective alternative to owning a personal vehicle, which may improve user satisfaction. The article [138] proposes a multi-agent multi-task dynamic dispatch based on MDP for optimal task allocation of SAEV in an AMoD system. The proposed approach includes a new instant reward function and a state-value function estimated by the back propagation-deep neural network to improve dispatching performance. Numerical results show significant improvements in revenue and user satisfaction. Ref. [139] proposes an integrated ride-sharing strategy with transit, and customizes queuing-theoretic algorithms for vehicle dispatch and idle relocation. The proposed method is tested through experiments with synthetic and Long Island-NYC case study instances, demonstrating consistently reduced travel and passenger journey times, and operating costs by up to 60%. The investigation conducted in [140] tackles the challenge of combined passenger and parcel transportation utilizing a mixed fleet of electric and gasoline vehicles. This complex scenario is formulated as a MILP model, strategically constructed on a time-expanded network. To address large-scale instances of the problem, the researchers introduce a network decomposition-based meta-heuristic. The effectiveness of this approach is assessed through its application to real-world instances, revealing that it efficiently and proficiently resolves the combined transportation problem. The findings suggest its potential applicability in aiding taxi companies with mixed fleets in optimizing route planning strategies. The author in [88] addresses the routing optimization problem for SAEVs by considering uncertain travel time, service time, and charging schedules.

The objective is to minimize operational costs using a branch-andprice algorithm. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a commercial solver, and sensitivity analyses indicate the impact of various factors on the SAEV service. The study provides insights for other applications, such as urban logistics. The research paper [141]
proposes a model that combines electric car-sharing and bicycle-sharing to optimize the distribution of SEV, considering subsidy cost and user satisfaction while considering multiple dynamic constraints. The genetic algorithm is used to solve the model, and the results show a significant reduction in relocation costs and increased user satisfaction.

of SAEV allocation in transportation or SAEV charge scheduling in a PN
may not be feasible when implemented in a practical CPTN. The interdependency between PN and TN must be formulated with predefined boundaries and mathematical models. Fig. 7 **illustrates coupled power** (modified IEEE 33 bus RDS) and transportation (25 nodes) networks with the representation of a geographic information system (GIS), road map, and power map. Very few research works conducted SAEV
integration in CPTN. In Fig. **7, the node-link is represented. In a nodelink connection, specific nodes (presented with BSS or charging station)**
that are dispersed across the traffic links and serve as components of the traffic flow are used to connect SAEVs to the power grid. Another way to represent CPTN is using a network flow model where the steadystate distribution of vehicular flow on the node and edge of the TN and power flow in the distribution network are determined by using traffic assignment problem and optimal power flow problem [142]. **Tables** 6 and 7 **compare the articles available in the direction of CPTN in terms** of vehicle type, PN and TN networks type, solution approaches, and other taxonomies.

TN models such as the Beckmann model, Nesterov model, and user equilibrium models have been studied in some of the literature. The optimal power flow is a strong need to validate the study conducted on the CPTN with SAEV integration. DC-OPF and AC-OPF are wellknown adopted methods. However, DCOPF simplified the problem, assumed a lossless system with a constant voltage angle, and ignored reactive power. Once both network models are created, there is a need to identify the coupling points. Following is some of the research on SAEV in the CPTN. The study of [126] examines the benefits of coupling charging and repositioning events for on-demand SAEV services in Austin, Texas. Results show that this strategy can reduce rider wait times, decrease empty travel, and improve fleet utilization. A sparser charging station design can also lower investment costs while keeping waiting times low. The research in [149] focuses on a novel business model that combines SEV and a ride-sourcing platform to provide transport and energy services. Two market competition models are developed to analyse the strategic interactions between the distribution network operator (DNO) and the SEV platform operator. The impacts of integrating the discharging service on the cruising traffic are studied using a CPTN. The research [150] focuses on the optimal operation of a cyber–physical system consisting of a large fleet of SAEV and charging hubs. The study considers practical features of power and transportation systems and proposes a mixed integer linear programming model.

Results show that power market considerations can yield significant savings, and a simplified myopic approach can handle larger fleet sizes and hub capacities with reduced computation time.

The study in [151] evaluates the emissions of SAEVs and compares them to ICE using real-world data from ride-hail service operations.

Results show that SAEVs are over five times less carbon intensive than ICE in the Californian power grid. Aligning SAEV charging with renewable generation and smart charging strategies can substantially reduce emissions, generating up to 95% less emissions than other charging strategies. Introducing a carbon tax can also enhance the costeffectiveness of emission mitigation. Ref. [152] proposes a charging station control strategy for energy management and voltage regulation in an autonomous microgrid with EVs connected to the charging stations. The strategy considers the dynamic behaviour of EVs, solar irradiance, wind speed, and load fluctuations. The proposed control strategy is assessed in two different modes: excess power mode and deficient power mode.

## 6.1. Optimal Location Of Cs And Pick-Up/Drop Points In Cptn

Since the planning problem defines the pick-up/drop locations and the number of stops for SAEV, the optimal location of charging stations is an important study. To ensure the efficient use of resources, the ideal location of charging stations should be determined by analysing the EV charging demand and power network capacity. Additionally, it is essential to locate charging stations near pick-up/drop locations to reduce travel distances for SAEVs and avoid traffic congestion. Furthermore, integrating the charging infrastructure into the power network can optimize its use of RES. It is important to consider the geographical, economic, and social factors to provide all users fair access to charging stations and pick/drop locations [153]. Finding the location of the charging station involves a study on the charging demand requested by SAEVs. Majorly, two research approaches were utilized, one was based on computational geometry (geographical nodes in TN and physical connection with PN), and the other was based on travel surveys (based on population density and simulations). The study in [126] explores the benefits of coupling charging and repositioning events to improve the performance of on-demand SAEV services. Using an agent-based model for the Austin, Texas region, the study found that this strategy reduces user waiting time, and empty travel due to repositioning or charging and improves fleet utilization. The results suggest that operators can adopt this framework to minimize waiting time for travellers while reducing investment costs through sparser charging stations.

## 6.2. Allocation And Uncertainties Of Saev And Cptn

The allocation of SAEV to a user's request is determined based on the availability of the nearest node to minimize waiting time for customers and travel costs. It is crucial to model uncertainties to achieve an optimal solution for SAEV allocation and charge scheduling.

Consideration of uncertainties is imperative in both the PN and TN. In the TN, uncertain parameters encompass factors such as the number of requests from each location within a specified time window, traffic congestion, accidents, etc. Ref. [154] studied the AMoD system, which uses SAEVs for delivery purposes, and the optimized parking, recharging, and rebalancing tasks are demonstrated. MDP is used to model the decision-making process, and two optimization models based on combinatorial optimization theory are built to optimize multi-action dynamic dispatching. Results show that combining combinatorial optimization with reinforcement learning theory can effectively solve the multi-action dynamic dispatching problem of SAEVs in the AMoD
system.

## 6.3. Modelling Objectives And Constraints In Cptn

The role of SAEV in a CPTN is based on the aimed problem formulation, which may lie in the planning or operational stage, as illustrated in Fig. **8. The planning problem aims to determine pick-up/dropoff locations, depots, reconfigure the electrical network, and identify**
optimal locations for charging stations, among other factors. On the other hand, operational problems involve modelling uncertainties in user behaviour, and the electric network including price, load demand, RES generation, relocation, travel cost minimization, charging cost minimization, allocation, and charge scheduling. There have been very few studies conducted on SAEVs in CPTN. PN and TN constraints are considered depending on the type of study. PN constraints mainly include power balance constraints, voltage constraints, charger limits, line limits, and ramp rates. In contrast, TN constraints include vehicle capacity, travel time, waiting time, trip cancellations, and the number of requests. The article by [155] explores the challenges SAEV fleets pose to network operators and shows that these challenges can be reduced by accounting for operational constraints and exogenous loads. The study concludes that coordination between SAEV and PN operators can mitigate the need for PN capacity upgrades and maintain the network's reliability.

The literature review has identified diverse modelling approaches employed for the planning problem, namely Mixed queueing network mod [156], Discrete-event simulation [157], Flow-based integer programming model [158], Aggregate model [159], Time-expanded location graphs [160]. For the operational stage, the modelling is followed by methods such as the theory of discrete choice model [43],
agent-based model [88], structural equation [161], theory of planned behaviour [162], technology acceptance model [163], analytical and simulation model [42] discrete graph-based model [164], unified network flow mode [13], etc. In the context of SAEVs in urban transportation networks, the study by [165] utilizes a Python-based agent-based simulation model, offering a tailored and expandable solution. This model integrates data-driven analytics and predictive analytics, reflecting real-world usage patterns and enabling proactive relocation and charging decisions. Similarly, [102] proposes a directed graphbased modelling approach for a joint rebalancing and V2G coordination strategy in CPTN, showcasing efficiency in reducing passenger waiting times and supporting V2G. The strategy is validated with real taxi service data from New York City, demonstrating operational effectiveness and reduced computational time. In [166], an analytical and agent-based traffic model for a multi-stage charging and discharging strategy for SAEVs is proposed, aligning fleet charging with low-cost hours to achieve significant savings and climate damage avoidance. The model addresses real-world considerations and explores trade-offs between peak power rate fees and societal emissions damages, emphasizing sustainable and cost-effective SAEV fleet operation. Lastly, [130]
presents a unified network flow model and a bilevel optimization model addressing the interdependence between SAEVs and BSSs. This model optimizes SAEV scheduling and BSS operation management, validated with real-world data from New York, contributing to the efficient and cost-effective integration of electric vehicles into shared mobility systems. 6.4. Contemporary solutions addressing SAEV's energy management and state monitoring In the dynamic realm of contemporary transportation, the emergence of SAEVs has presented an array of transformative challenges, with energy management and real-time state monitoring being pivotal concerns. The integration of AI, connectivity, electrification, and big data opens up an opportunity to revolutionize individual mobility. The impending introduction of full AU, particularly in restricted level-4 domains, represents a crucial juncture, transforming automobiles from

![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)

simple consumer products into accessible networks available either ondemand or through subscription models. This transformative shift is envisioned to unfold progressively, integrating EVs with AV capabilities and nurturing innovative business models like AV Subscriptions. The industry's profit potential is poised for significant growth, influenced by the network effect restructuring the automotive value chain. However, thoughtful consideration of regional disparities, weather conditions, and nuances in vehicle segmentation is imperative for formulating effective investment strategies during this transformative phase. The trajectory of level-4 AV adoption post-2021 is expected to surpass consensus expectations, impacting both automakers and suppliers. Essentially, the Car of the Future not only pledges to address current mobility challenges but also to fundamentally redefine the nature of personal transportation. It has been revealed that shared EVs can absorb more than 50% of the annual surplus renewable energy generation in the high-renewable scenario projected for 2030, preventing potential curtailment. Additionally, the V2G capabilities of SAEVs can contribute services to the power grid, such as spinning reserve, peak power generation, and operating reserve [167]. Several studies have developed a simulation methodology for SAEVs, illustrating that a fleet of SAEVs could replace 7 to 10 private cars, offering cost-effective transport services with low break-even prices and the potential to supply operating reserve to the electric grid, indicating significant grid-scale storage and spinning reserves in a wide implementation scenario [42–168].

Exploration encompasses promising technologies like solid-state batteries, digital twin applications, wide bandgap technologies in power electronics, and the integration of Li-Fi technology, providing insights into potential improvements in EV performance, cost, and environmental impact by 2030. The pursuit of optimal energy consumption in SAEVs has triggered innovation in advanced battery technologies, where the investigation of high-energy-density batteries and solid-state solutions holds promise for extending range and reducing charging times. Concurrently, the integration of predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms into SAEV operations emerges as a pivotal strategy, enabling dynamic energy management through the analysis of historical data and real-time conditions. Another notable aspect of this discourse revolves around V2G integration, a paradigm shift that positions SAEVs not merely as consumers but as contributors to the energy grid during idle periods, thereby enhancing grid stability and revenue generation. On the state monitoring front, the incorporation of sophisticated sensor technologies, including LiDAR, radar, and cameras, facilitates real-time tracking of vehicle conditions, strengthening safety measures and fortifying the foundation of autonomous decision-making. Simultaneously, the synergy of connectivity and IoT solutions ensures continuous monitoring of vehicle health, enabling remote diagnostics and proactive maintenance measures. Moreover, the application of blockchain technology emerges as a beacon of trust, guaranteeing the integrity and security of the data generated by SAEVs. By dedicating a focused section to these contemporary solutions, we not only gain insight into the current technological landscape but also lay the groundwork for a sustainable and intelligent future of SAEV mobility, wherein efficiency, safety, and environmental consciousness converge to redefine the parameters of modern transportation.

## 7. Critical Reviews And Future Research Recommendations 7.1. Critical Reviews

1. **Approaches for modelling charging demands in published literature can be broadly categorized into two major groups. The**
first category employs a computational geometry-based method that disregards the organizational aspects of the TN and assumes charging demands at geographical nodes. Some studies rely on statistics from travel surveys or population densities, while others utilize simulations or data-driven methods to predict EV charging demand. The second category comprises origin–
destination flow-based methods that specifically consider limitations on the SAEV driving range within the TN. Few scholars have explored interdisciplinary issues in SAEV charging station planning, which involves connecting the electric PN and TN
through charging infrastructure.

2. **Extensive research has been conducted on the financial benefits of employing SAEVs for autonomous mobility-on-demand**
services.

3. **The necessity for charging infrastructure spread across the service territory is crucial for SAEVs due to their limited driving**
range. However, this operational infrastructure's reliance on the local PN may increase investment and operational costs, as well as GHG emissions, particularly if electricity production involves burning coal or natural gas.

4. **Limited research attention has been directed towards the planning of charging systems within the framework of the SAEV**
challenge. There exists a necessity to delve into the intricate relationship between various SAEV parameters, including vehicle capacity, battery rating, and consumption, and critical charging factors such as the number of charging points at stations, occupancy rates, and charger ratings. This exploration should extend to encompass passenger distribution aspects, considering
R. Sumitkumar and A.S. Al-Sumaiti factors like density, travel demands, starting and end points, duration, and stops. This interconnected web of SAEV parameters, charging infrastructure, and passenger distribution constitutes a complex problem that can be characterized as the distributioncharging-transportation problem, especially in the context of on-demand mobility services provided by SAEVs.

5. **The research field has seen fewer publications on charging system planning for SAEVs. It is essential to investigate further the**
relationship between SAEV parameters (vehicle capacity, battery rating, specific power consumption, etc.) and charging factors (number of charging points in charging stations, occupancy rate, charger rating, pricing policy, etc.).

6. **While separate research has delved into trip order, charge schedule, depot parking, and repositioning, incorporating the redistribution objective at the decision stage is crucial, given its**
significant impact on the performance of mobility-on-demand services.

7. **The efficacy of the dynamic dispatching process of SAEVs needs**
validation across delivery, charging, repositioning, recharging, and trip order assignment.

8. **With the rise of connected features in vehicles and the presence**
of cyber–physical systems, the increasing threat of cyber-attacks on vehicles poses a substantial risk to passengers, drivers, and users' privacy.

9. **Evaluating the trade-off between the sizing of SAEV vehicles'**
batteries and charging infrastructure requires in-depth case studies and simulations, considering practical factors such as traffic congestion, specific power consumption of vehicles, and trip distance.

10. **The exploration of SAEV application in providing services to the**
grid, such as reactive power support in vehicle-to-grid reactive power (V2GQ), to enhance grid parameters and performance remains unexplored and warrants further investigation.

## 7.2. Future Research Recommendations

The present research is not thorough on SAEV integrated into CPTN.

Much research has been conducted on PN modelling and solution approaches. However, combined PN and TN studies need more precision modelling and solution approaches. The future research recommendations are as follows.

1. **In addressing the modelling challenges within the CPTN and**
its inter-dependencies, a detailed solution involves revising the current interface equation that outlines the mutual dependence of power and the TN. This revision should encompass a more sophisticated and comprehensive modelling approach to enhance accuracy.

2. **To ensure proper and equitable load distribution between the**
PN and TN, a solution lies in implementing a coordinated load management system. This system will prevent any bus in the PN from shouldering an excessive load and ensure that roads in the TN do not experience undue traffic. This coordinated approach is instrumental in maintaining the stable and safe operation of the CPTN.

3. **Previous research predominantly addressed individual**
challenges in SAEV systems. A comprehensive solution involves integrating vehicle redistribution tasks into the decision-making stage of mobility services. This incorporation recognizes the significant role that vehicle repositioning plays in the overall efficiency of the system.

4. **Balancing charging cost, user satisfaction, and profit when selecting vehicles for specific passengers necessitates the creation**
of multi-dimensional and cumulative reward systems. These systems should accurately reflect the matching degree between each SAEV and its designated delivery task, ensuring a holistic approach to decision-making.

5. **Given the uncertainties surrounding critical factors in CPTN**
modelling, such as renewable energy source availability, decision-making, traffic congestion, and accidents, a robust solution involves incorporating uncertainty modelling techniques. Techniques like stochastic optimization and robust optimization are essential for accurately representing and addressing uncertainties in CPTN modelling.

6. **Evolving ancillary service provisions, specifically voltage and**
frequency support using V2G, require a solution that considers the long-term impact on SAEV battery degradation. This involves ongoing research and development to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of these ancillary services.

7. **The challenge of computation tractability in the real-time implementation of various services discussed in the paper requires**
a comprehensive solution. This solution should address issues related to solution resolution, intervals, memory requirements, data processing, integrity, and security. Effective solutions in these areas will contribute to the overall efficiency and reliability of the CPTN.

8. **Achieving the ambitious decarbonization target set by government agencies requires comprehensive studies into replacing ICE**
with EV and SAEV. This requires micro-level modelling and a thorough life cycle assessment of SAEV during production and operational stages (charging/discharging/driving/idle). It ensures a holistic understanding of climate change and sustainability of SAEV contributing to critical insights to the realization of decarbonization goals.

## 8. Conclusion
