ITS is defined as "a system for solving variety of problem that road traffic faces through exchange of information between road, people, automobile and city" [4] as shown in Fig. 1. The major objectives of ITS are to evaluate, develop, analyze and integrate advanced technologies in order to achieve efficiency, conserve energy, save time, enhanced safety measures, improve sustainability and contentment for driver, pedestrians, and other traffic groups [12–14]. So, with the help of ITS, we can transform the unorganized transportation environment into an intelligent and connected system. To achieve the intelligence and adaptive management, the International Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) [15] has created a roadmap of six evolutionary levels, as depicted in the Table 2. Now, we may witness the business unfolding the fashion of self-driving automobiles in the current period. For example, various business brands like as Waymo, Tesla,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                  |

the development of Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS) for better transportation management which was officially renamed as Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) in the year 1994 by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) to reflect a broader mission, including all parts of public transportation and intermodal connections [11]. ITS is defined as "a system for solving variety of problem that road traffic faces through exchange of information between road, people, automobile and city" [4] as shown in Fig. 1. The major objectives of ITS are to evaluate, develop, analyze and integrate advanced technologies in order to achieve efficiency, conserve energy, save time, enhanced safety measures, improve sustainability and contentment for driver, pedestrians, and other traffic groups [12–14]. So, with the help of ITS, we can transform the unorganized transportation environment into an intelligent and connected system. To achieve the intelligence and adaptive management, the International Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) [15] has created a roadmap of six evolutionary levels, as depicted in the Table 2. Now, we may witness the business unfolding the fashion of self-driving automobiles in the current period. For example, various business brands like as Waymo, Tesla, and other automotive companies are developing to usher in the growth of self-driving automobiles. Yet, to achieve the essence of Level 4 and 5 of vehicle automation is still an aspiration to many automotive organizations and researchers. Thus, the fundamental area to achieve the complete automation in transportation is exchanging the information with all entities on the road. In this context, with the introduction of Cooperative - Vehicle to Everything based, communication adds new life to ITS mission. We can have Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), Vehicle-toInfrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) communication, which makes mobility safer and more connected in LOS and NLOS circumstances [16]. 1.2.

High pressure on public transport and logistics/delivery services due to emergence of various business outlooks. 4.

Efficient usage of live and open data traffic management.

Thus, the direct solution for addressing the alarming issue is by improving the infrastructure and by finding various methods to make the transportation smarter, which must be economically and environmentally sustainable. So, some of the expectations we do have for the transportation environment transformation in the phase of 2 to 5 years? are [9,10]. 1. Accident free transportation 2. Adaptive support system for higher traffic flow scenarios 3.

Higher vehicle utilization and 4. More efficient/greener transport (zero emission vehicles). With the rapid evolution in Information Technology (IT), sensors, geo-location and communication technologies lead to emergence of mind-boggling applications which given a pathway for deploying strategies in a very intelligent manner by understanding the surrounding environment, which lead to The two primary technologies that support V2X are 1.802.11p
(DSRC) and 2.C-V2X, lets look into the details one by one; 1. 802.11p (DSRC): The original V2X communications utilize Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) enables vehicles to exchange information with each other and with traffic infrastructure.

This technology facilitates direct communication between vehicles (V2V) as well as between vehicles and traffic infrastructure (V2I). The communication occurs when two V2X senders come within range, forming a vehicular ad-hoc network. This unique characteristic eliminates the need for dedicated communication infrastructure, ensuring reliable communication and safety in remote or sparsely populated areas. WLAN, which offers low latency, is highly suitable for V2X communication. It transmits specific message types such as Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM), Basic Safety Messages (BSM), and Decentralized Environmental Notification Messages (DENM). Additionally, it supports the transmission of other messages related to roadside infrastructure, including Signal Phase and Timing Messages (SPAT), In Vehicle Information Messages (IVI), and Service Request Messages (SRM). These messages contain minimal data volume, optimizing efficiency and performance. The radio technology employed in V2X communication is part of the WLAN IEEE 802.11 family of standards. In the United States, it is referred to as Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE), while in Europe, it is known as ITS-G5
[17]. To enhance the direct communication mode, vehicles can also be equipped with traditional cellular communication technologies, enabling V2N (vehicle-to-network) based services. This extension, incorporating V2N capabilities, has been successfully implemented in Europe through the C-ITS platform umbrella [18]. But, the DSRC spectrum faces potential challenges in the current era due to various factors: 1. Spectrum Scarcity: The spectrum allocated for DSRC is limited and confined to the 5.9 GHz band. This limited spectrum availability poses challenges in accommodating the increasing demand for wireless communication in the transportation sector. As more ITS applications, connected vehicles, and stringent network requirement (as shown in the Table 4 referred from
[19]) emerge, the existing DSRC spectrum may become congested, resulting in potential interference and degraded performance. 2.

Spectrum Competition: The 5.9 GHz band is also used for other purposes, such as Wi-Fi services, which can lead to competition for spectrum resources. As Wi-Fi and other wireless technologies continue to proliferate, the DSRC spectrum may face challenges in ensuring reliable and interference-free communication for ITS
applications the relative studies are done by the author [20]. Spectrum sharing and coexistence mechanisms are necessary to mitigate the potential conflicts between different wireless systems utilizing the same frequency band. 3. Technological Advancements:
The rapid advancements in wireless communication technologies, such as 5G and beyond, introduce new capabilities and requirements for ITS. These technologies offer higher data rates, ultra-low latency, massive device connectivity, and network slicing, enabling advanced applications and services in the transportation sector.

However, DSRC, being a legacy technology, may struggle to keep pace with the evolving connectivity demands and technological requirements of modern ITS systems.4. Regulatory Considerations:
The allocation and utilization of spectrum are subject to regulatory policies and decisions. Regulatory bodies may need to reassess and reallocate spectrum resources to accommodate the changing needs of ITS communication. The static allocation of the 5.9 GHz band for DSRC may not align with evolving wireless communication requirements, potentially hindering the adoption of newer and more efficient technologies, various prior studies are done to check the system level performance of DSRC, some of the studies are [21–24].

To address these challenges, the industry and researchers has been exploring alternatives such as Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (CV2X) technology.

2. C-V2X: C-V2X communication utilizes cellular networks, has emerged as an advanced version of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
technology that is based on WLAN. Its distinction from WLANbased V2X has prompted various industry organizations, including the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), to advocate for C-V2X,
emphasizing its advantages while overlooking its potential drawbacks [25]. Initially defined as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 14 [26], C-V2X is designed to operate in two main modes: Direct Communication
(V2V, V2I) and Device-to-Network (V2N). Direct Communication relies on PC5 interface. The PC5 interface refers to the point where User Equipment (UE) can directly communicate with another UE
through the direct channel, eliminating the need for communication with the base station. Proximity Service (ProSe) is the feature that governs the architecture of direct communication between UEs at a system architectural level. In 3GPP Radio Access Network (RAN) specifications, the term "sidelink" is used to describe direct communication over the PC5 interface. Moreover, C-V2X allows the C-V2X device to utilize the cellular network connection through the Uu interface, which represents the logical interface between the UE and the base station. This mode is commonly referred to as vehicle-to-network (V2N) communication. V2N is a unique use case specific to C-V2X and is not present in 802.11p-based V2X
since the latter exclusively supports direct communication. Other important advantage is C-V2X offers a more flexible and scalable solution that can overcome the spectrum scarcity challenges faced by DSRC. Some of the technical ways are 1. Shared Spectrum:
C-V2X operates within the licensed spectrum allocated for cellular networks, typically in the 4G LTE or 5G frequency bands. By utilizing shared spectrum, C-V2X can leverage the existing cellular infrastructure, including base stations and network resources.

This eliminates the need for a dedicated spectrum allocation for V2X communication, making more efficient use of the available frequency resources [27]. 2. Dynamic Spectrum Allocation: Unlike DSRC, which relies on a dedicated frequency band (5.9 GHz) for V2X communication, C-V2X can dynamically allocate spectrum resources based on demand and network conditions. With dynamic spectrum allocation, C-V2X can adapt to changing communication needs and allocate resources as required, maximizing the utilization of available spectrum. 3. Coexistence with Cellular Services:
C-V2X is designed to coexist and operate alongside the existing cellular services. It utilizes advanced radio resource management techniques to ensure efficient sharing of the spectrum with other cellular users. By leveraging the infrastructure and spectrum already deployed for cellular networks, C-V2X can make effective use of the available resources without causing interference or congestion [28]. 4. Evolution to 5G: In 3GPP Release 15, V2X functionalities were expanded to include support for 5G. C-V2X encompasses both direct communication between vehicles (V2V, V2I) and traditional cellular-network-based communication (V2N), providing a migration path to 5G-based systems and services. With the deployment of 5G networks, additional spectrum is made available as studied in the paper [29], enabling C-V2X to benefit from the expanded frequency resources. This evolution to 5G opens up new opportunities for enhanced V2X communication and supports the growing demand for bandwidth-intensive applications in the transportation sector. Table 3 provides the comparison of the two primary technologies such as DSRC and C-V2X in terms of various physical layer parameters as referred from [30].

## 2. C-V2X Societal Implications In Terms Of Growth Of **C-V2X** Research

Here are some key potential insights on C-V2X societal implications, some studies are done in [31–33]: 1. Improved Road Safety:
One of the primary motivations for C-V2X research is to enhance road safety. By allowing vehicles to exchange real-time information, such as location, speed, and status, C-V2X enables advanced safety applications like collision avoidance, intersection management, and emergency vehicle warning systems. This technology has the potential to greatly reduce accidents, injuries, and fatalities on the road. 2. Increased Traffic Efficiency: C-V2X technology can significantly improve traffic flow and efficiency. By enabling vehicles to communicate with traffic infrastructure, traffic signals, and other vehicles, C-V2X can optimize traffic patterns, reduce congestion, and enhance overall transportation system performance.

This can lead to shorter travel times, reduced fuel consumption, and improved air quality in urban areas. 3. Enhanced Autonomous Driving: C-V2X plays a crucial role in the development of autonomous vehicles. By providing vehicles with real-time situational awareness through communication with other road users and infrastructure, C-V2X can enhance the decision-making capabilities of autonomous vehicles. This application can reduce the travel delay and more importantly it will bring sustainable transportation.

4. Integration with Smart Cities: C-V2X research aligns with the broader concept of smart cities, where various technologies are integrated to create more sustainable and efficient urban environments. C-V2X can be integrated with intelligent transportation systems, smart infrastructure, and other urban mobility solutions to enable seamless communication and coordination. This integration can improve traffic management, public transportation, emergency response, and overall quality of life in cities. Not only that, C-V2X
can also bring quantitative benefits to the society by improving the economic status. Table 5 presents the scenarios and net benefits from the perspective of the European Commission for ITS. The European Union has identified four different scenarios for evaluating the cost and benefits associated with various volumes and timescales of V2X adoption [34,35].

## 3. Revolutionizing Vehicle Connectivity: 3Gpp'S Journey **Towards** Advanced C-V2X **Communication**

In this section, we will explore some of the most promising enhancements to C-V2X that are currently being developed by 3GPP,
including Release 14, Release 15, Release 16, and Release 17 [36].

These updates are expected to significantly improve the performance and functionality of C-V2X technology.

LTE-based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technology that is backed by Evolved Packet Core (EPC) to improve communication scalability and reliability. The V2X system is designed to deliver three distinct services: Road Safety, Traffic Efficiency, and Infotainment, all aimed at enhancing safety, reducing traffic congestion, and providing real-time information to drivers [37].

V2X system offers multiple communication interfaces, including PC5 (Side link) and LTE Uu (Cellular Uplink/Downlink). The system supports four modes of message delivery, namely Unicast Delivery, Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) Delivery, Localized MBMS Delivery, and Simultaneous LTE Uu, PC5 Delivery. To ensure seamless communication between vehicles and infrastructure, LTE
V2X system has been designed for deployment in two configurations: In-Coverage (LTE Uu, PC5) and Out-of-Coverage (Uu). Where the In-Coverage (LTE Uu, PC5) allows for continuous communication between vehicles and infrastructure within cellular coverage, while the Out-of-Coverage (Uu) provides reliable communication even in areas outside cellular coverage [38,39]. In this release 14, V2X system also offers support for V2X control function, enabling secure and authorized access to V2X services. Additionally, the system incorporates IEEE 1609.2 security standards for application layer security, providing authentication, privacy, and message integrity for V2X communications.

In this release, C-V2X has leveraged to enhance PC5 communication to facilitate seamless communication between vehicles and infrastructure [40]. The system supports a wide range of eV2X services, including Advanced Driving, Platooning, Extended Sensors, and Remote Driving, with the goal of improving road safety and

enhancing the driving experience [41]. To enable efficient communication, V2X system provides multiple communication interfaces, including PC5 Interface (Side link) and Carrier Aggregation (CA) for mode 4 [42,43]. Additionally, the system incorporates a synchronization procedure for multiple carriers and supports 64QAM modulation for enhanced data transmission rates. C-V2X system also enables pool sharing between mode-3 and mode-4 user equipment, allowing for greater flexibility and efficiency. Moreover, in this release the V2X system provides faster message transmission periods, ensuring timely and accurate communication between vehicles and infrastructure.

V2X system leverages LTE and NR-based communication technologies, backed by 5G-core support, to enhance communication efficiency and scalability. The system enables seamless interworking of EPS V2X and 5G systems, ensuring compatibility with existing infrastructure and enabling a smooth transition to nextgeneration V2X solutions. V2X system supports all identified V2X
and eV2X services, providing a comprehensive suite of features aimed at enhancing road safety, improving traffic flow, and providing real-time information to drivers [44,45].

The NR side link enhancements have further improved the performance of V2X communications by enabling direct communication between nearby vehicles and devices. The architecture of the 3GPP has been enhanced to support advanced V2X and safety services, which include features like improved positioning accuracy and efficient resource management. User equipment (UE) power saving techniques have been introduced to extend the battery life of V2X devices, which is particularly important for ensuring uninterrupted communication in emergency situations [47,48]. The support for advanced services such as autonomous vehicles, extended virtual reality (VR) based remote driving, drone support for V2X [49] and holographic V2X services have further expanded the scope of V2X communications. Dynamic spectrum sharing of LTE and NR technologies has enabled efficient and flexible use of radio resources for V2X communications, which helps in mitigating interference and improving the overall system performance.

Enhanced side link positioning and ranging techniques have improved the accuracy and reliability of V2X communication, which is essential for enabling safety-critical applications [50]. Additionally, edge communication has been introduced to reduce latency and improve the responsiveness of V2X communications, which is particularly important for real-time applications [51,52]. In 3GPP
release 17, several new features have been introduced to enhance 5G capabilities and support various verticals and deployment scenarios. These developments focus on five key areas: Reduced Capability user equipment, Non-terrestrial Networks (NTN), frequency bands beyond 52 GHz, and the multicast and broadcast service (MBS) [53,54]. The first area, Reduced Capability user equipment, enables the fulfillment of service requirements that lie between relaxed massive machine-type communication (mMTC) demands and highly stringent ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements. In the realm of Non-terrestrial Networks, release 17 incorporates new network topologies based on high-altitude platforms, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, and geosynchronous orbit satellites. NTN serves as a complement to terrestrial networks, extending network coverage to remote areas over land and sea where terrestrial infrastructure is absent. This development encompasses NR, Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT), and LTE for Machine broadband (MBB) and massive IoT services from release 17 onwards. To expand the frequency range, release 17 extends the existing frequency range 2 (FR2) beyond 52.6 GHz up to 71 GHz. This extension facilitates the inclusion of new licensed and unlicensed frequency bands within this range. The existing NR downlink/uplink waveforms are utilized in this expansion [55]. The multicast and broadcast service (MBS) in release 17 offers improved resource efficiency and requires less operational effort compared to its 4G predecessor, Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service. MBS primarily caters to important use cases in public safety, including mission-critical push-to-talk, over-the-air software updates, live TV, video delivery, and IoT solutions. The 5G Quality of Service (QoS) framework, applicable to 5G MBS traffic, enables differentiated packet forwarding, particularly crucial during high traffic load scenarios in the realm of public safety applications. These advancements in 3GPP release 17 strengthen 5G's support for new use cases, paving the way for enhanced connectivity and services in diverse verticals and deployment scenarios. Fig. 2 represents the 3GPP's journey towards the advanced V2X communications, with the brief of what accomplishments have been done in each release till release 17.

In the upcoming 3GPP release 18, notable additions for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) use cases include beamforming/MIMO, mobility enhancements, and network power savings
[52]. These features aim to improve signal transmission and reception, enhance user mobility in the network, and optimize power consumption. Furthermore, significant enhancements are expected for non-eMBB use cases, building upon the reduced capability user equipment introduced in release 17 (as explained in Section 3.4).

Release 18 will introduce two key additions for non-eMBB scenarios: Extended Reality (XR) and National Security and Public Safety (NSPS) [56,57]. NSPS addresses critical communication requirements for national security and public safety applications, ensuring reliable and secure connectivity in emergency situations. Additionally, release 18 will introduce three cross-domain functionalities applicable to both mobile broadband (MBB) and non-MBB use cases. These functionalities include the utilization of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) for physical layer (PHY) enhancements, AI/ML for Radio Access Network (RAN) enhancements, and full duplex communication capabilities. The RAN standardization efforts will focus on establishing a comprehensive framework for AI/ML-related PHY enhancements, encompassing AI/ML modeling, evaluation methodologies, and performance requirements/testing. One specific area where AI/ML can bring concrete enhancements is in beam management or channel estimation. Moreover, release 18 aims to bring advancements in eMBB with the introduction of Advanced Antenna Systems (AASs). These systems enhance spectral efficiency by optimizing antenna configurations and beamforming techniques. Additionally, improved Dynamic Spectrum Sharing mechanisms will be incorporated to facilitate smooth migration from previous generations to 5G networks, maximizing spectrum utilization and efficiency [51].

## 4. Exploring The Endless Possibilities Of C-V2X Use **Cases**

As the world rapidly moves towards an era of smart cities and connected devices, C-V2X technology explores the innovative use cases of C-V2X technology that can provide valuable insights into its endless possibilities and the transformative impact it can have on our daily lives. In this section, let's see how the use cases have emerged in a powerful way by referring to the 3GPP and 5GAA
releases.

In Release 14, there is a significant emphasis on the primary use cases of LTE-V2X, as outlined in TS 22.185 [58,59]. The release provides robust support for various types of communications including V2V, V2I, V2P, and V2N. The three main key features concentrate on 1. Road Safety 2. Road Efficiency and 3. Infotainment
[60,61]
- Road Safety: The primary goal of this use case is to decrease traffic accidents by enforcing rigorous network stability and latency requirements. LTE V2X uses short message services that are periodically sent by vehicles to neighboring vehicles at a locally geographical level to provide road safety services.

- Road/Traffic Efficiency: One potential use case for LTE-V2X is the optimization of traffic flow by improving route design, particularly in situations like vehicle platooning. Vehicles would gather sensor data, transmit it to remote management servers in charge of route planning, and then get feedback from those servers. Compared to certain critical road safety use cases, the latency, and reliability demands for above applications are slight less. However, in scenarios involving high speeds, the network must still ensure minimal packet loss and latency.

- Infotainment: A highly flexible application of LTE-V2X involves the integration of traditional and innovative internet services to enhance the travel experience of passengers. This application combines various services such as web browsing, data sharing, downloading, and social networking. It is noteworthy that this use case is not subject to stringent network restrictions, providing a high degree of flexibility for users.

These fundamental safety services are addressed by Rel-14 V2X
(LTE-V2X), which permits the delivery of messages such as Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) or Basic Safety Message (BSM), as well as Decentralized Environmental Notification Message (DENM)
[62]. CAM/BSM deliver the messages periodically to the neighboring vehicle about the heading direction, speed, geographical coordinates etc. DENM's are alerts that may contain a variety of messages depending on the circumstances that caused them to be sent, such as unexpected braking, an impending accident, or a traffic bottleneck.

In this Release 14, the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the QoS levels that enable V2X communications state that the assumed maximum speed to support the V2V communication is 500 Km/h, while the maximum for V2P and V2I is 250 Km/h. The latency requirements in general case would be 100 ms and in stringent cases it is 20 ms. The range for allocating the reasonable safety buffer would be 140 m at 140 km/h and the periodicity of the message transfer would be 10 to 50 messages per second.

V2X services that were identified in Rel. 14 TR 22.885 [63]
are 1. Caution for Imminent Collision 2. Alert for Control Loss 3.

Alert for emergency vehicles 4. Collaborative adaptive cruise control 5. V2V and V2I based emergency vehicle stop 6. Queue warning 7. Automated Parking System 8. Road Safety Services 9. Wrong way driving warning 10. V2X data transfer 11. Pre-crash sensing warning 12. V2N based traffic flow optimization 13. Curve Speed Warning 14. Vulnerable road user 15. V2X minimum QoS 16. V2P
supported Pedestrian Road Safety 17. Multimodal traffic control 18.

Remote diagnosis 19. Enhancing the positional preciseness of the vehicles.

Release 15 expands the 3GPP support for improved V2X that is enhanced V2X (e-V2X) by trailing the success of Rel 14. According to TS 22.186 [64], the NR V2X technology supports four major applications as mentioned below, 4.2.1. Vehicle *platooning* Platooning entails maneuvering several vehicles in a group while efficiently controlling their movements. To guarantee that the vehicles are coordinated safely, the lead vehicle relays crucial information to the other vehicles in the platoon. Algorithms for platoon management make it possible for vehicles to brake or accelerate concurrently while keeping a safe gap between them. This innovation optimizes road capacity, promotes fuel efficiency, and enables more efficient transportation [65,66]. Several crucial V2V communication requirements are necessary to support platooning
[67,68], including:
- End-to-end communication delay between a group of vehicles should be 25 ms and 10 ms for the highest degree of automation
- 99.99% level of highest of automation and 90% message reliability for efficient decision execution
- Relative longitudinal location precision of less than 0.5 m - Broadcasting rate: 10 to 30 messages per second
- Dynamic communication range management to enhance resource economy due to the variable platoon size, as well as to limit message spread for privacy concerns

4.2.2. Advanced *driving* The advanced driving use case is aimed at supporting semiautomated and fully autonomous driving by allowing for the exchange of data between vehicles and road infrastructure, including Roadside Units (RSUs). This service promotes the sharing of information between vehicles and infrastructure, including data obtained from local sensors and the driving intentions of the driver, with other nearby vehicles [69,70]. This facilitates vehicle coordination and the adjustment of trajectory to improve safety, Cooperative Collision Avoidance (CCA), and road efficiency [71]. The potential communication requirements [72] would be:

- Extremely high bandwidth to support burst transmission of extremely large data
- Extremely low latency, less than 10 ms for the highest level of automation
- 99.99% message reliability is needed 8
4.2.3. Extended *sensors* Extended Sensors are a critical enabler for enabling vehicles to share raw or processed data from local sensors with various elements on the road, such as neighboring vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs), pedestrian User Equipment (UE), and V2X Application Servers (V2X AS). This exchange of information provides vehicles with a comprehensive understanding of the road environment, allowing them to make informed decisions and react accordingly [73,74]. The resulting benefits include reduced accidents and adaptive traffic management, making this use case a necessary feature in the era of autonomous driving. For example, even if a vehicle or pedestrian is approaching from a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) region, this use case enables all road elements to gain awareness. This is particularly useful in intersections and adverse environmental conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and snow. So, the potential communication requirement to handle this use case are,

- High bandwidth availability
- Ultra-low latency communication that is less than 10 ms
- 95% message reliability
- Support for heavy congested areas by providing required resource based on the critical or non-critical service requirements
4.2.4. Remote *driving* With the help of V2N, it is now possible for a human operator to drive a car remotely with the evolution of cloud-based applications. Remote driving may be leveraged in a variety of situations, including 1. Backup solution for the Autonomous vehicle car 2. Enable the fleet owners to remotely control the vehicle 3. Enable cloud driven public transportation and private shuttles [75,76]. The potential network requirements to support this use case would be;

- Ultra-low latency and reliable communication:
- Reliability greater than 99.99%
- End to End latency for the V2X communication would be less than 5 ms
- Should support vehicular speed up to 250 Km/h
- Data rate: Downlink: 1Mbps; Uplink: 25Mbps
When there is certain difficult situation where the vehicle cannot execute the process automatically, the vehicle will stop or move to a position with the least amount of risk, at which point it will ask a remote-control operator to take over and guide it around the obstacle. The streaming sensor data for example like HD video camera, lidar, and radar that will be temporarily made available to the remote controller to comprehend the impediment and decide the direction the vehicle must take. Once the obstruction has been removed or gone, and the car will then resume the complete autonomous mode back again.

On the whole, the TS 22.186 [64] has specified some global key requirements that will be achieved they are, several degrees of automation will be covered in TS 22.186. Not only that in TS 22.186 it defines the stringent specifications that it should support maximum throughput of 1 Gbps, maximum latency of 3 ms, maximum reliability of 99.999%, and a maximum transmission rate of 100 messages per second. In the Technical Report 22.886 [58] various scenarios and use cases has been related to these stringent policies as mentioned in TS 22.186.

use cases.

## 4.6. Its Supported V2X Use Cases

In the following subsections, the potential ITS applications such as Environmental Sensing, Enforcement's, Emergency Vehicle Management, Pavement Condition Management System, and other important applications of ITS are discussed.

4.6.1. Environmental *sensing* C-V2X technology has several application-oriented details that can significantly impact various aspects of transportation and the environment. Here are some key application-oriented details of CV2X Environmental Sensing: 1. Real-Time Weather and Road Condition Monitoring: C-V2X Environmental Sensing enables vehicles to collect real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and visibility. This information can be shared with other vehicles and infrastructure, providing valuable insights for drivers and transportation authorities to make informed decisions. For example, vehicles can be alerted about slippery road conditions due to rain or ice, helping drivers adjust their speed and driving behavior accordingly. [83]. 2. Air Quality Monitoring:
C-V2X can also be utilized to monitor air quality levels in realtime. Vehicles equipped with environmental sensing capabilities can detect pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. By sharing this information with other vehicles and urban monitoring systems, C-V2X can contribute to improving air quality management in cities. For instance, drivers can receive notifications about areas with high pollution levels, encouraging them to reroute or take alternative modes of transportation. 3. Intelligent Traffic Signal Control: C-V2X environmental sensing can enhance traffic signal control systems by providing vehicles with information about traffic patterns and signal timings.

Vehicles equipped with C-V2X technology can communicate their speed, location, and expected time of arrival at intersections to the traffic signal infrastructure. This enables adaptive signal control, optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion. As a result, drivers experience smoother journeys with reduced waiting times and lower fuel consumption. [84]. 4. Emergency Vehicle Warning Systems: C-V2X plays a crucial role in improving emergency vehicle operations. When an emergency vehicle, such as an ambulance or a fire truck, approaches an intersection, it can send alerts to nearby vehicles through C-V2X communication. These alerts can inform drivers about the approaching emergency vehicle, allowing them to yield and make way in a timely and safe manner.

This technology significantly improves emergency response times and enhances road safety. Also, with the help of C-V2X, the emergency vehicle warning can be communicated to other intersection by intimating using a digital display board to alert the users in the routed intersection [85,86]. 5. Wildlife Detection and Collision Avoidance: Environmental Sensing in C-V2X can help detect and mitigate wildlife-vehicle collisions. By utilizing sensors such as radar, vehicles can detect the presence of animals near the road and share this information with other vehicles. In areas prone to wildlife crossings, this data can be utilized to issue warnings to drivers, reducing the risk of collisions and protecting both human life and wildlife. 6. Road Infrastructure Monitoring: C-V2X environmental sensing enables continuous monitoring of road infrastructure conditions [87]. Vehicles equipped with environmental sensing sensors or hardware's can detect road hazards such as potholes, debris, or damaged signage. This information can be shared with other road users and road maintenance authorities, enabling proactive maintenance and improving overall road safety. 4.6.2. *Enforcement* Enforcement using C-V2X technology offers various applicationoriented benefits for enhancing traffic enforcement and improving road safety. Some of the interesting applications are as follows,

![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)

1. Speed Enforcement: C-V2X technology enables real-time communication between vehicles and infrastructure, allowing for efficient speed enforcement. Enforcement agencies can deploy C-V2Xenabled speed sensors or cameras at strategic locations to detect vehicles exceeding the speed limit. When a speeding violation is detected, a warning message can be sent directly to the offending vehicle, alerting the driver to slow down and promoting compliance with speed limits. 2. Red Light Violation Detection: C-V2X
technology can be used to detect red light violations at intersections. By equipping traffic signal systems with C-V2X capabilities, enforcement agencies can identify vehicles that illegally enter intersections after the light has turned red. Violation alerts can be sent to both the violating vehicle and nearby vehicles, promoting safer driving behavior and reducing the risk of intersection collisions [83,5]. 3. Distracted Driving Monitoring: C-V2X technology can aid in detecting and monitoring distracted driving behaviors. By analysing vehicle movement patterns and sensor data collected from vehicle, identifying signs of distracted driving, such as sudden lane departures or erratic driving behavior can be detected.

If a vehicle is detected to be engaging in distracted driving, then warnings can be sent to the nearby vehicles to encourage safer driving practices. 4. School Zone Safety: C-V2X technology can improve safety in school zones by enabling targeted enforcement measures. With the help of school zone signs, crosswalks and other sensor information, C-V2X will have the ability to detect vehicles that violate school zone speed limits or fail to yield to pedestrians. Violation alerts can be sent to the offending vehicle or nearby vehicles, promoting adherence to school zone safety regulations, these typical applications of ITS to enable safety is showcased in [88,89]. 5. Parking Enforcement: C-V2X technology can assist in parking enforcement by providing real-time information about parking violations. Parking sensors equipped with C-V2X capabil4.6.3. Emergency vehicle *management* Emergency vehicle management is one of the key applications to get benefited utilizing the C-V2X technology; some of the applications are, 1. Priority Signal Pre-emption: C-V2X enables emergency vehicles to communicate with traffic signals and prioritize their passage. When an emergency vehicle is approaching an intersection, it can send a signal to the traffic light system to preemptively change the signal in favor of the emergency vehicle, ensuring faster response times and smoother traffic flow with the help of various sensors and hardwares like radar, GPS and cameras. 2. Intersection Collision Avoidance: C-V2X technology can enhance intersection safety by providing real-time alerts and warnings to both emergency vehicles and other road users. By sharing information about their location, speed, and intended path, C-V2Xenabled vehicles can detect potential collision risks at intersections and take appropriate action to avoid accidents. 3. Adaptive Traffic Congestion Management for Emergency Vehicles: C-V2X enables emergency vehicles to communicate with traffic management systems and provide real-time updates on their location, route, and estimated time of arrival. This information can be used to optimize traffic flow, adjust signal timing, and dynamically reroute other vehicles to minimize congestion and create clear paths for emergency responders, some key aspects of these applications are projected in [5,85,33]. 4. Hazardous Area Warnings: C-V2X technology can transmit warnings to vehicles in the vicinity of hazardous areas or incidents, such as accidents, road closures, or construction zones. This information can help emergency vehicles navigate safely and efficiently while providing other drivers with early alerts to avoid potential hazards [90]. 5. Data Sharing of Patients Health:
C-V2X enables emergency vehicles to transmit critical data, such as patient health information or incident details, to command centres in real-time. This data sharing enhances situational awareness, enabling emergency responders to better prepare and allocate resources accordingly. 6. Enhanced Navigation and Routing for Emergency Vehicles: C-V2X technology can provide emergency vehicles with up-to-date information on traffic conditions, road closures, and alternative routes. This real-time navigation assistance helps emergency responders choose the fastest and safest paths to their destinations. These application-oriented details demonstrate the potential of C-V2X in revolutionizing emergency services and creating a safer and more connected transportation ecosystem [91].

4.6.4. Pavement condition management *system* Some of the interesting applications of the pavement condition management systems utilizing the C-V2X technology are as follows; 1. Real-Time Pavement Monitoring: C-V2X technology allows vehicles equipped with pavement monitoring sensors to transmit real-time data about pavement conditions to a central control system. This information includes data on potholes, cracks, surface roughness, and other anomalies. By collecting this data from multiple vehicles, a comprehensive and up-to-date picture of the pavement condition can be generated, enabling timely maintenance interventions. Apart from that, Pavement Condition Management System can leverage C-V2X technology to enable users to provide feedback on pavement conditions and report issues in real-time. Using smartphone applications or in-vehicle systems, drivers can share their observations about road conditions, such as potholes or rough patches, which can be aggregated and used to prioritize maintenance activities [83,5]. 2. Early Warning System: C-V2X enables vehicles to receive real-time notifications about hazardous pavement conditions ahead. When a vehicle detects a significant pavement defect, it can transmit warning messages to nearby vehicles equipped with C-V2X technology. This proactive approach enhances road safety by alerting drivers to potential hazards, allowing them to adjust their driving behavior accordingly and avoid accidents. 3. Dynamic Routing and Traffic Management: PCMS using C-V2X technology can provide accurate information about pavement conditions to traffic management systems. By integrating this data into the overall traffic management framework, authorities can dynamically reroute vehicles away from roads with poor pavement conditions, reducing the risk of damage to vehicles and improving overall traffic flow. 4. Maintenance Planning and Resource Allocation: The real-time pavement condition data collected through C-V2X technology can be used to prioritize maintenance activities and optimize resource allocation. By analysing the collected data, authorities can identify sections of the road network that require immediate attention and allocate maintenance crews accordingly, leading to more efficient and cost-effective pavement maintenance, more information on these applications is given in
[84,86,91,90,29]. 5. Work Zone Safety: C-V2X technology can improve safety in work zones by enabling communication between construction equipment, workers, and vehicles. Construction vehicles and workers can transmit their location and presence in work zones to approaching vehicles, providing advanced warnings and ensuring safer navigation through the construction area.

4.6.5. Some other important applications of ITS
1. Incident Management and Emergency Response: C-V2X technology facilitates quick and accurate incident detection and response. The real-time incident alerts from C-V2X-enabled vehicles, such as accidents or road hazards, enabling faster response times and appropriate emergency services dispatch. C-V2X can also support the coordination of emergency vehicles by providing real-time location information and optimizing routes to incident scenes [92].

2. Transit Management and Passenger Information: C-V2X technology can improve transit management and provide real-time information to passengers. Transit vehicles equipped with C-V2X can transmit their location, estimated arrival times, and service status to the passengers. This allows for better coordination of transit operations, accurate arrival predictions, and improved passenger experience. 3. Pedestrian Safety: C-V2X technology can enhance pedestrian safety by enabling direct communication between vehicles and pedestrians. The road side infrastructure equipped with C-V2X capabilities, allowing pedestrians to receive alerts and warnings from nearby vehicles [93]. This promotes safer interactions between vehicles and pedestrians, reducing the risk of accidents, especially at intersections and crosswalks. This information is referred from [86,75,83], where authors showcase the key perks of the emerging application in terms of ITS.

## 5. 3Gpp Referred C-V2X **Architectures**

3GPP has developed two significant architectures for Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication. The first one is based on Long-Term Evolution (LTE) infrastructure, while the second one is based on the 5G system. These architectures provide the necessary framework for C-V2X communication, enabling vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians. In the following sections, we will delve into the specifics of each architecture to provide a detailed view of how they operate.

## 5.1. Lte Architecture For V2X Communications

The LTE-V2X architecture consists of two main components: the LTE network and the V2X application platform. The LTE network is responsible for providing the necessary communication infrastructure to support V2X communications, while the V2X application platform provides the necessary protocols and interfaces to enable V2X communication [38]. The LTE architecture for V2X communications consists of several key components [94], including: - V2X
Control Plane: The V2X Control Plane is responsible for managing the registration, authentication, and authorization of V2X devices with the LTE network. It also provides the necessary signaling to establish and release V2X communication sessions between vehicles and infrastructure. - V2X User Plane: The V2X User Plane is responsible for the transmission and reception of V2X data between vehicles and infrastructure. It uses the LTE Radio Access Network (RAN) to provide low-latency and high-reliability communication between V2X devices. - V2X Application Layer: The V2X Application Layer is responsible for providing the necessary communication protocols to enable V2X communication with the support of V2X Application Platform. It includes several sub-layers, such as the V2X message layer, the V2X security layer, and the V2X
discovery layer. - V2X Transport Layer: The V2X Transport Layer is responsible for providing the necessary transport protocols to enable V2X communication. It includes the User Datagram Protocol
(UDP) and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). - V2X
Network Layer: The V2X Network Layer is responsible for providing the necessary network protocols to enable V2X communication. It includes the Internet Protocol (IP) and the IPv6 over LTE protocol.

The LTE-V2X architecture over the Evolved Packet Core (EPC),
as outlined in the Rel.14 and Rel.15 versions of TS 23.285 [95], is illustrated in the Fig. 4. Fig. 4 providing a high-level overview of the LTE-V2X architecture, how the communication works in both in coverage and out of coverage scenarios. The LTE architecture for V2X communications 4 outlines the involvement of EPC entities, their specific roles, and the interfaces used in the communication process. The specification also introduces a new functional entity known as the V2X Control Function, which is responsible for managing the V2X-related parameters of User Equipment (UEs).

![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)

According to the specifications outlined in TS 23.285 [96], User Equipment (UE) can be configured with V2X policy and parameters in four different ways. These options involve storing the configuration on the Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), preconfiguring it on the Mobile Equipment (ME), provisioning it via the V3 interface using the V2X Control Function, or configuring it through the V1 interface by the Application Server. When a UE connects to the Evolved Packet System (EPS) through a PDN connection, the V2X Control Function initiates the configuration provisioning process.

While the logical V2X Control Function facilitates the authorization procedure and provides provisions for the necessary V2X parameters, as outlined in the TS 24.386 protocol [97]. As per the protocol, UE and V2X Control Function work together to establish the required parameters and authorization for V2X communication.

Fig. 4 illustrates how vehicles, RSUs, and UEs can communicate with each other with the support of LTE-V2X RAN, EPC and V2X AS. The LTE C-V2X standard, introduced in Rel-15, enables the creation of ITS applications that offer messaging and other services via LTE-EPC. Rel-14 of the 3GPP defines two modes of V2X
communication using a single cellular technology, namely the PC5 interface and the LTE Uu interface. The PC5 interface enables direct communication between UEs, while the LTE Uu interface typically connects UEs to an LTE eNB. UEs can use these communication modes independently, and then decide which one to use with the help of the application layer, as per TS 23.285 [95]. Furthermore, LTE-V2X supports inter-PLMN architecture, and roaming architecture apart from the system architecture as outlined in TS 23.285
[95]. In order to determine and authorize whether the user equipment is as a Vehicle UE and/or a Pedestrian UE, the V2X Control Function and the HSS utilize protocols over the V4 interface for UE authorization. The V2X Control Function may also require service authorization information from the V2X subscription data in the HSS to operate efficiently. TS 29.388 [98] outlines the procedures and information elements exchanged between the V2X
Control Function and the HSS over the V4 interface. If the V2X
Control Function in the home PLMN requires authorization information from the visited PLMN, it may request it from the V2X
Control Function in the visited PLMN. The visited PLMN's V2X Control Function may share extra information about the V2X AS, like its FQDN or IP address. Additionally, it can specify the UE's authorization to use PC5-based communications or communications over MBMS through interface M1 with an eNB and the EPC. The MBMS requires BM-SC entity participation and the presence of a MBMS-Gateway for QoS management and multicast/broadcast session announcements.

TS 23.285 and TS 29.389 [99] are two significant standards in the telecommunications industry, which provide system architecture and procedures for V2X communication. As we know, TS
23.285 focuses on LTE PC5 interface communications in C-V2X and outlines the system architecture and roaming architecture. On the other hand, TS 29.389 explains the communication protocol between two V2X Control Functions using V6 interface. Both interfaces use the diameter protocol for verification, registration, and accounting. The V2X communication configuration of a UE can be determined by configurable parameters from various sources such as the USIM application, ME, or V2X Control Function. TS 24.385
[100] outlines a set of guidelines that use Management Objectives
(MO) to establish V2X configuration parameters, which encompass service-related settings, radio frequencies, and radio interfacespecific parameters. In general, the V2X communication standards offer comprehensive directions for configuring all components related to V2X communication. With the use of a standardized and interoperable approach, these standards guarantee dependable and secure communication among various entities such as vehicles, infrastructure, and other connected devices.

5.1.1. LTE PC5 V2X interface *communication* For V2V and V2P services that utilize PC5 interface for communication beyond network coverage, the adaptive resource selection is the only option. Therefore, UEs must be pre-configured to utilize frequency and parameters as defined in Radio Access Technologies. However, it is important to cooperate with PLMN operators to ensure fair utilization and prioritization of radio resources, particularly when vehicles choose PLMN managed connectivity [101–103].

As per TS 24.386 [104], PC5-based V2X messages contain a data PDU, Layer-3 protocol (either IP or non-IP), source Layer ID, broadcast destination Layer ID, and V2X message family.

Potential applications of PC5 Interface: The PC5 interface has several applications in C-V2X networks, they are but not limited too: 1. Collision avoidance: The PC5 interface enables vehicles to exchange safety-critical information, such as speed and position, to avoid collisions.2. Traffic management: The PC5 interface enables RSUs to communicate with vehicles to provide real-time traffic information, such as road closures and accidents.3. Pedestrian safety:
The PC5 interface can be used to alert pedestrians of oncoming vehicles, reducing the risk of accidents. 4. Emergency services: The PC5 interface can be used to enable emergency services to quickly respond to accidents and other emergencies. 5.1.2. LTE Uu V2X interface *communication* Before the Release 14, V2X communication can only occur within the range of the User Equipment (UE). However, with the help of 3GPP Rel-14, UE can communicate with the aid of Uu interface using standardized EPS connectivity. This new feature enables the relay of communications through 3GPP Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service, allowing UEs to connect to the V2X Application Server (AS) and to other UEs using the Uu interface. This connection allows for transmissions using the uplink and receiving either unicast or broadcast V2X messages that are intended for a specific UE from another UE using the downlink. When it comes to sending V2X messages on the downlink, there are two methods that the network can choose from 1. Single Cell Point-to-Multipoint (SCPTM) and 2. Multicast/Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN). Thus, these messages can be transmitted through two types of IP paths: 1. GBR bearer which guarantees a fixed bitrate, and 2. Non-GBR bearer, which doesn't guarantee the bit rate. To ensure efficient communication between a vehicle and a larger set of UEs in its vicinity, as well as reaching UEs located further away, dedicated QCI values for V2X messages are defined in 3GPP TS
23.203 [105]. Unicast delivery can be achieved using GBR or NonGBR bearers, while broadcast delivery is limited to GBR bearers.

The LTE Uu interface can handle both IP and Non-IP based V2X
messages. When transmitting Non-IP messages, UE first encapsulates them in IP packets. The Uu interface can be used to configure V2I and V2N service categories through network configurations, and specific QCI values can be defined to ensure efficient communication flow over Uu. The V2X Application Server (AS) can also use the Uu interface to set mandatory parameters for a UE, as specified in TS 23.285 [106]. To send non-IP based V2X messages, the usual approach is to use User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and IP,
except when Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is expressly specified. These messages are directed to a designated address for the V2X AS. For effective communication, the V2X Control Function enables subscription mechanisms for Uu communications, making it feasible to aim at V2X AS that serve clusters of nearby UEs situated in particular physical locations. The V2X AS transmits V2X messages via unicast or broadcast using the MBMS delivery method.

The V2X AS address can be obtained through the V2X AS discovery procedure, which can use pre-configured V2X AS information or the / MBMS procedure as specified in TS 24.386 [107]. To support V2X communication, user subscription data is very much necessary for PC5 counterpart authentication and access controls, if the data is requested, Uu interface provides the information.

One approach to minimize the delay in V2X communication is to utilize a localized MBMS method. This technique restricts the transmission of V2X messages to their intended UEs, without requiring any alterations to existing protocols. Instead, preconfigured data, including IP multicast address, MBMS-Gate Way IP address, and Broadcast-Multicast Service Centre (BM-SC) IP address, are conveyed to the BM-SC through the xMB and MB2 interfaces, as specified in TS 29.116 [108] and TS 29.468 [109], respectively. When the BM-SC receives this data, the MBMS bearer is activated, allowing the V2X AS to send the message to the UE
through the MBMS bearer. TS 29.061 [110] defines the standardized communication protocols between the BM-SC and MBMS-GW.

## 5.2. 5G System Based V2X Communication Architecture

The 5G system architecture for V2X communications is specified by 3GPP in the Rel.16 which includes several key components as shown in the Fig. 5. The first component is the User Equipment
(UE), which refers to the devices used for communication, such as a car, smartphone, or other IoT device. The UE communicates with the 5G network using radio access technology such as New Radio (NR) or LTE. The second component is the Radio Access Network (RAN), which includes the base stations (gNBs) that provide wireless connectivity to the UEs [111,112]. The RAN is responsible for handling the radio interface and is used to transmit and receive data between the UE and the core network. The third component is the Core Network (CN), which provides the services and functionality necessary to support V2X communication. The CN includes the 5G core, which is responsible for managing network resources, routing traffic, and providing services such as authentication and authorization [113,29,114].

One important feature of the 5G architecture for V2X communications is the use of a dedicated V2X Service Area (VSA), which is a specific part of the 5G network that is optimized for V2X communications. This ensures that V2X messages are delivered with low latency and high reliability, which is critical for safety-critical applications. In addition to these features, the 5G system architecture for V2X communications also includes the support for network slicing, which allows network operators to create customized network slices for specific V2X use cases [115,116]. This enables operators to optimize network resources and provide the required level of performance and reliability for each use case [117,76].

Other technical details in 3GPP/Release 16 related to V2X communications include the support for edge computing, which enables low-latency processing and analysis of V2X data at the network edge, and the use of security mechanisms such as certificate-based

![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)

authentication and end-to-end encryption to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of V2X messages.

The 3GPP has created the 5GS architecture for V2X communications, which can be used over the existing LTE PC5 and E-UTRA
Uu interfaces. This makes it compatible with Rel-15 PC5 and Uu reference points. NR PC5 and NR Uu interfaces are also supported in the 5GS architecture, which cater to UEs with NR V2X capabilities. The V2X AS, which represents the AF, is responsible for providing service parameters for V2X communications [118,119]. The 5G V2X architecture is based on the fundamentals established in Rel-14 and Rel-15 for LTE V2X and is compatible with LTE CV2X. The architecture also enables Cross-Radio Access Technology
(CRAT) scheduling, by supporting the interfaces such as LTE - PC5 and NR - PC5 interface. TS 23.287 [120] defines the reference model for inter-working between EPS V2X and 5GS V2X in the 5G architecture.

The Fig. 6 shows how different types of communication scenarios using NR technology are integrated into the overall system architecture for V2X communication, using various reference points and network functions as defined in TS 23.287 [120]. The system uses 5G technology, and certain network functions involved in V2X
communication are highlighted in violet. The orange arrows indicate how communication is facilitated with the help of uplink, downlink and side-link facilitated by the 5G NR V2X interfaces. Although there isn't a dedicated LTE V2X Control Function in the 5G
system, it can be used when connecting with 5G nodes that have LTE connectivity or when scheduling communication between different types of Radio Access Technologies. The Fig. 6 shows the platoon scenario (in our case just assumed: car) and how groupcast mode is handled using a standardized approach. In this scenario, it's important to note that it's the upper layer (control layer),
not the MAC layer, that's responsible for managing the allocation of group-cast addresses [121].

When there is no dedicated LTE V2X Control Function, the responsibility of transmitting a UE's authorization status to the NGRAN node falls on to the 5GC handling. The V2X authorization and provisioning functions are decentralized and spread across various 5GC components involved in V2X communication. The Policy Control Function (PCF) is an essential part of configuring V2X policy and parameters, including QoS, QoS profile, radio functionalities, NR - Uu and NR - PC5 configuration parameters, over the CP plane Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signaling, supported by the PLMN. If any issues arise with the policy or functionalities provided by the PCF for V2X communications, the UE can initiate a User Equipment based Policy Provisioning procedure to connect with the PCF and address the issue.

To enable V2X communications over the Uu and PC5 interfaces to the UE, the standard specifies various methods for providing or updating the V2X configuration parameters. These methods are as follows: 1. pre-storing the parameters in the Mobile Equipment (ME), 2. configuring them in UICC, 3. simultaneously storing them in the ME and configuring them in the UICC, 4. receiving them from the V2X Application Server (AS) through the Policy Control Function (PCF) or V1, and 5. obtaining them directly from the PCF.

5.2.1. NR PC5 V2X *communication* The NR PC5 interface supports group cast communications among adjacent UEs, where the application layer is responsible for managing groupcast groups and configuring parameters such as Application ID and Layer 2 ID. In Rel-16, connectionless groupcast utilizes the MCR sidelink parameter, ensuring high reliability and low latency for nearby vehicles. V2X applications can utilize customized QoS profiles via the Per-Flow PC5 QoS Model, where preconfigured information is available if required. Additionally, NRPC5's Quality of Service support is improved and matched with Uu

interface quality profile through specific values of the 5G QoS Identifier parameter for the V2X communications.

As of Rel-16, a UE can use both NR - PC5 and LTE - PC5 for V2X
services, depending on a variety of factors. These factors include the availability of services, the user's subscription, their authorization, and the communication configurations profiles of the V2X
application being used. With the support of NR - V2X interface, newer vehicles can now communicate with older vehicles that may only support LTE - PC5. The EPS architecture has been updated to support V2X communication over the NR - PC5 interface. A User Equipment that has NR-V2X support can simultaneously use unicast, groupcast, and broadcast modes [122]. To align it with the features provided by 5GS, the 3GPP updated the V2X architecture for NR-PC5. UE V2X configuration parameters for NR-PC5 communication are obtained through a session-less policy management mechanism, using policy provisioning via PCF. This involves the UE presenting a list of V2X capabilities to the 5GC, which then prompts the PCF to configure V2X policies on the UE. These policies include radio-related parameters like suitable spectrum, authorized Radio Access Technology can be LTE or NR, application oriented, and QoS profile for NR PC5 interface [123,124]. 5.2.2. NR Uu V2X *communications* The NR Uu interface is a radio interface that connects the User Equipment (UE) with the Next-Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN) node in the 5G System (5GS) architecture. It is used for V2X communication, which enables vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians [125]. Here are the technical details of the NR Uu V2X interface in terms of its working in the 5GS architecture.

The NR Uu interface uses the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme with multiple subcarriers and sub-channels. It supports both Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) modes. The interface uses a new protocol stack designed for 5G networks, which includes the NR radio access network protocol stack and the 5G Core network protocol stack. The NR radio access network protocol stack includes the Physical layer, MAC layer, RLC layer, and PDCP layer. The 5G Core network protocol stack includes the Application layer, Transport layer, Session layer, and Network layer. The NR Uu interface supports advanced Radio Resource Management
(RRM) mechanisms, which optimize the allocation and management of radio resources based on the UE's Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements, network conditions, and available radio resources. The RRM mechanisms include dynamic scheduling, link adaptation, and power control. The interface also supports QoS parameters for 5G services, which are used to prioritize traffic and ensure the required level of service quality. The QoS parameters include throughput, latency, and reliability requirements [126–128].

The NR Uu interface supports advanced security mechanisms, including mutual authentication, key management, and encryption.

These mechanisms ensure the security and privacy of 5G communications. The interface also supports beamforming, which is a technique used to enhance the signal strength and quality by focusing the transmission beam towards the UE. This technique enhances the coverage and capacity of the 5G network [129]. In the V2X context, the NR Uu interface provides a reliable and efficient communication interface between the UE and the NG-RAN node. The interface allows vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians. The UE sends and receives V2X messages using the NR Uu interface, which are processed by the NG-RAN node and forwarded to the appropriate destination.

The V2X messages include safety-related messages, traffic management messages, and infotainment messages. The interface also supports cross-RAT scheduling, which enables V2X communication over different RAT's (NR PC5 and LTE PC5) [130,131].

The 5G System (5GS) is equipped with additional configuration options to streamline V2X communications over NR Uu interface. These options include support for IP and Unstructured PDU Session Types. Rel-16 provides flexibility in choosing the transport protocol, enabling applications to select the most suitable one. The 5GS
also offers other configuration parameters like DNN, SSC Mode, SNSSAI, and 5QIs [44]. In order to simplify the implementation of a separate network slice specifically for V2X services and allow for easy roaming across multiple operators, a new SST has been introduced in TS 23.501 [132]. Furthermore, the 5G system can now support V2X applications with various configuration specifications based on the quality of service (QoS) profile, which can enhance the overall V2X experience. The V2X Application Server (AS) can communicate with the 5GS and provide specific requirements for the V2X service. The V2X AS can also suggest alternative Quality of Service (QoS) profiles for the NG-RAN through the Policy Control Function (PCF). The Session Management Function (SMF)
is informed if the NG-RAN supports the suggested alternative QoS
profiles. If it does, the SMF sends the AQPs to the NG-RAN. This feature helps the NG-RAN to be more adaptable to the V2X service and provides more QoS options for delivering the service
[61,133,134,76,135].

5.2.3. 5GS application layer for V2X
The 5GS provides application layer support for V2X through the use of V2X application protocols, which are implemented using standard 3GPP protocols such as the Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) and the Application Function (AF). The SCEF enables V2X application servers to access network capabilities and to receive notifications about V2X services from the network. The AF acts as an intermediary between the application servers and the network, providing service-level information to the network and managing the allocation of network resources [136,137]. In addition, the 5GS includes support for the V2X application layer using HTTP-based protocols, such as the Constrained Application Protocol
(CoAP), which are used for machine-to-machine communications.

The 5GS also supports the use of the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) for voice and multimedia communications, as well as the Diameter protocol for authentication and authorization.

Furthermore, the 5GS provides a flexible architecture for V2X
applications, allowing for the deployment of dedicated network slices that are tailored to the specific needs of the application [56].

This allows for the efficient use of network resources and the provision of high-quality services to users.

## 6. Additional Technologies That Support **C-V2X**

To enable the use cases of C-V2X that require support for extremely low latency, high reliability, and high throughput, various advanced technologies such as Software Defined Networking, Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, Blockchain, and AI-based support for V2X are rapidly emerging.

## 6.1. Empowering C-V2X With Edge Computing

The 3GPP standards define Edge Computing as a technology that provides computing resources and services at the edge of the network, closer to the devices and applications [138]. For C-V2X,
Edge Computing can help reduce the latency of the communication and provide a more reliable and secure service. Edge Computing for C-V2X involves deploying computing resources, such as servers and storage, at the edge of the cellular network, in close proximity to the C-V2X devices. This allows for faster processing of the data generated by the devices, as well as faster response times to the requests sent by the devices, some of the previous studies
[139–141] showcases the potential of edge computing in C-V2X. Several architectures for Edge Computing, including Distributed Edge Computing, Centralized Edge Computing, and Hybrid Edge Computing are realized in the studies [142–146]. In Distributed Edge Computing, computing resources are distributed across RSUs in the network. In Centralized Edge Computing, all computing resources are centralized in a single RSU or a data center. Hybrid Edge Computing combines the benefits of both distributed and centralized architectures [147,113]. In addition, several Edge Computing services, such as the ITS Edge Service (ITES), the ITS Mobility Edge Service (ITMES), and the ITS Security Edge Service (ITSES)
are realized from the studies but not limited too [148–150]. These services provide various functions, including traffic management, data processing, and security services. In addition, Edge Computing can predominantly help with data management and security. By processing the data at the edge of the network, the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to the core network can be reduced, which in turn reduces the risk of data breaches and cyber-attacks.

The 3GPP standards also define the interfaces between the Edge Computing resources and the cellular network [149]. These interfaces allow for the seamless integration of the Edge Computing resources with the rest of the network, enabling the network to leverage the benefits of Edge Computing for C-V2X, some of the inspiring studies are [151–153].

## 6.2. Transforming Vehicular Networks With Sdn In C-V2X

SDN can play a critical role in enabling the efficient and flexible management of C-V2X networks. The authors in [5,154–156] provide technical details for the use of SDN in the context of C-V2X.

According to the studies, Service Communication Proxy (SCP) acts as an SDN controller. The SCP is responsible for managing and controlling the flow of data between the network and the V2X applications. The SDN controller communicates with the C-V2X network elements through standard northbound APIs and manages them by configuring their forwarding rules. This architecture enables the dynamic and automated management of network resources, which can improve network performance and efficiency. The SDN-based C-V2X architecture allows for dynamic network slicing, which enables the network to be sliced into multiple virtual networks, each optimized for specific types of V2X services. This enables the network to efficiently allocate resources based on the specific needs of each V2X service, which can improve overall network performance and reduce latency [157]. The SDN-based C-V2X architecture also includes a Network Slicing Selection Function (NSSF), which is responsible for selecting the appropriate network slice based on the service requirements of the V2X application, many studies related to this is provided by authors in [158–161]. The NSSF can use various parameters, including the QoS requirements, service type, and UE location, to determine the optimal network slice for a given V2X service. In addition, the SDN-based C-V2X architecture supports the use of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), which enables network functions to be deployed and scaled in a more flexible and efficient manner. This can help reduce the overall cost of deploying and operating the network, while also improving its scalability and flexibility.

## 6.3. Integration Of Ai For C-V2X Enhancements

Various use cases for AI in C-V2X, including: 1. Predictive Maintenance 2. Intelligent Traffic Management 3. Road Safety 4. Autonomous Driving. Some of these studies are already done in the papers [162,117,163]. Some of the technical enhancements in terms of AI integration in cellular networks, such as, 1. Advanced Machine Learning models 2. Deep Neural Networks 3. Computer Vision 4. Reinforcement Learning models 5. Federated Learning and Natural language Processing (NLP). To support the integration of AI with SDN, some of the possible solutions are already studied in [164–166], such as: 1. Network Slicing: Network slicing can be used to dynamically allocate network resources to support specific C-V2X use cases, such as autonomous driving or predictive maintenance. 2. Virtualization: Network virtualization can be used to create virtual network functions that can be dynamically allocated to support specific C-V2X use cases. 3. Network Automation: Network automation can be used to automate network management tasks, such as resource allocation and traffic routing, to support AI-enabled C-V2X applications. 6.4. Enhancing V2X communication through programmable edge and cloud *intelligence* SDN, NFV and Edge Intelligence emerge as the principal technologies as discussed above, which will play a pivotal role in seamlessly integrating and managing communication networks characterized by their heterogeneity. The conceptual architecture which is presented in the Fig. 7, involves the utilization of SDN to leverage software-based approaches in separating network control from the forwarding (or data) plane. This decoupling process effectively separates routing and control procedures from specialized hardware-dependent forwarding operations. By enabling this decoupling, network control dynamics can be programmatically managed using software, with an abstract perspective of the physical infrastructure. A centralized network controller takes charge of the network intelligence, maintaining a comprehensive overview of the network, and making informed decisions on policies related to automated network optimization and management, among other aspects. This adoption of softwarization in the network architecture extends the application range of 5G systems, enabling the implementation of RAN dis-aggregation, many prior works in regards to this were studied by the authors [167–171,102]. In this dis-aggregated setup as shown in the Fig. 7, Radio Units (RUs) functions as the basic trans-receivers, while control and processing operations are performed through software utilizing open interfaces and APIs. This development is evident through the availability of numerous open source SDN solutions specifically designed for mobile networks, including ONOS (Open Networking Operating System) [172], CORD (Central Office Re-architected as a datacenter) [173], O-RAN [174], ONAP (Open Network Automation Platform) [175], Aether [176], and SD-RAN (Software Defined Radio Access Network) [177]. As studied by one of the authors in
[178], SDN controllers can be deployed in the cloud, which can use machine learning algorithms to predict traffic conditions, optimize network resource allocation, and detect network anomalies.

The integration of cloud enables the collection of global data from the data plane; accordingly, network policies can be adapted periodically as per the applications and services defined by network operators. These updated policies are then sent back to the core network configurations, and the new policies are adapted back to the data plane, ensuring smooth functioning of the system. Realtime response to changing conditions can be achieved by deploying micro-services to the cloud, which can be triggered by events detected by edge devices or SDN controllers, containerization technologies, such as Docker or Kubernetes as studied in [179]. Furthermore, with the integration of Network Function Virtualization
(NFV) in the cloud, enhances the management and orchestration capabilities of software-defined networks, providing scalability and flexibility to the network. This is achieved by virtualizing network services and functionalities, separating them from the underlying hardware on which they are executed. Each functionality is implemented as a software-based Virtual Network Function (VNF) in cloud. This approach enables efficient resource allocation and enables the dynamic deployment and scaling of network functions as needed [180,181].

In the presented conceptual architecture 7, the incorporation of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), as per the definition proposed by the ETSI [182] and 3GPP in Release 15 and 16, will bring forth the significant advantages by bridging the gap between hardware and software solutions, thereby placing computational resources closer to end-users [183]. Where the edge server, act as a local database, continuously receives real-time information pertaining to vehicle and base station configurations. This information includes details such as Vehicle ID, Speed, Geo-Location, Traffic Status, Subscriber Info, Network Rules, Modulation, Correction Codes, Beam formation mode, and resource requirements, some of the inspired works which showcased the potential of integrating the MEC are
[184–186]. Edge Server can be deployed with the AI models on edge devices such as network switches, routers, and base stations to reduce latency and improve real- time decision-making capabilities. In terms of the application module, the edge server can optimize various tasks, such as Mobility Management, Traffic Management, Authentication, Transmission, and resource allocation schemes, along with Cluster Information. This optimization is achieved by utilizing locally stored information in the database and by capitalizing on control plane network optimization supported by the core network and cloud computing. To effectively implement edge AI in the context of Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (CV2X) communication, specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) is required to accelerate AI model computations. For in-depth analysis and reviews of different MEC architectures and integrating Edge Intelligence is studied by the authors in [187–190], interested readers can refer.

## 6.5. Block Chain Technology For The Enhancements Of C-V2X

Blockchain technology can help C-V2X communications in various ways, as it can provide a secure and decentralized platform for data sharing and authentication. Here are some technical details [191,192] of how blockchain technology can help C-V2X as per 3GPP: 1. Data Sharing: Blockchain technology can be used to securely and transparently share data between connected vehicles 17

and infrastructure, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the data [193]. For example, vehicle location data and traffic flow data can be shared on the blockchain to improve traffic management and reduce congestion. 2. Authentication: Blockchain technology can be used to authenticate and authorize connected vehicles and infrastructure, ensuring that only authorized entities can access and use the network. For example, blockchain-based identity management systems can be used to securely identify and authenticate vehicles and their owners. 3. Security: Blockchain technology can be used to provide a secure and tamper-proof platform for storing and sharing sensitive data, such as vehicle maintenance and repair records. This can help prevent fraud and ensure the safety of vehicles and their passengers [194]. 4. Smart Contracts: Blockchain technology can be used to automate the execution of smart contracts, which can enable more efficient and secure transactions between connected vehicles and infrastructure. For example, smart contracts can be used to automatically pay for tolls or parking fees, or to facilitate insurance claims.

## 6.6. Security Mechanisms For C-V2X

5G-based security mechanisms for cellular-based V2X communication systems are designed to provide robust protection against cyber threats and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of V2X data and applications [195]. Here are some of the security mechanisms [83]: 1. Secure Bootstrapping: Secure bootstrapping is a process of establishing a secure connection between the communicating parties. In 5G and advanced 5G-based cellular V2X, secure bootstrapping can be performed using the 5G-AKA
(Authentication and Key Agreement) protocol, which uses mutual authentication and key exchange to establish a secure connection.2. Cryptography: Cryptography is a technique used to secure data by transforming it into a secure format. In 5G-based cellular V2X, cryptography is used to protect data in transit and at rest.

Advanced cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption, quantum-safe cryptography, and post-quantum cryptography can be used to provide additional protection against future cyber threats. 3. Security-by-Design: Security-by-Design is a design approach that incorporates security into the development of V2X systems and applications from the outset. In 5G-based cellular V2X,
security-by-design can be used to ensure that V2X systems and applications are secure by default and remain secure throughout their lifecycle [196]. 4. Security Auditing and Monitoring: Security auditing and monitoring are essential for detecting and responding to security incidents. V2X - security auditing and monitoring can be used to monitor V2X traffic, detect anomalies, and respond to security incidents in real-time continuously with the help of Edge AI technology [197].

Regional Insights: In 2021, Asia Pacific had a market share of USD 259 million for automotive V2X. The main players working on vehicle-to-everything development in this region are telecommunication technology providers and automobile OEMs [212,213].

It is anticipated that Japan and China will dominate technological advancement in the Asia Pacific region [214,215,31]. For instance, level 4 autonomous vehicles, which can nearly always drive without human control, are being tested in a vehicle-to-everything pilot zone of the Yongchuan district in Chongqing [216,215]. The market is predicted to grow strongly throughout Europe. Numerous research projects, business alliances, and cooperative testing for vehicle-to-everything connection were seen in the area. For instance, the development and deployment of intelligent transport systems on European roads is the focus of the CAR 2 CAR
communication [18] consortium, which is made up of numerous technology developers and automakers. Due to increased vehicleto-everything technology implementation by major automakers in this region, North America is anticipated to have significant market growth. With the U.S. State Route 33 Smart Mobility Corridor, Honda is working in collaboration with the Ohio Department of Transportation to create the V2X environment with the largest density of its kind [217]. Similarly, Audi announced a trial programme for cellular vehicle-to-everything installations starting in Q3 of 2020 in collaboration with the Virginia DOT [218]. The Alliance for automobile Innovation (AAI) estimates that in 2019, over 60% of the automobile market share in the United States would be held by firms who have already deployed or have announced deployments of C-V2X. These elements will therefore fuel the market's expansion in this area [219]. Partnerships and collaborations: Several companies are investing heavily in the development of C-V2X technology.

## 9. Research Challenges And **Directions**

As we know, C-V2X communication is an evolving technology that has the potential to revolutionize the automotive industry.

However, several research challenges must be addressed to ensure the successful implementation and adoption of C-V2X. These challenges include interference management, channel estimation, network slicing, security, and the integration of emerging technologies such as edge and cloud AI.

## 9.1. Interference Management

Interference management is one of the critical research challenges in the successful implementation and adoption of C-V2X
technology. Interference can arise from various sources, including other wireless communication systems, environmental factors, and user behavior. The interference can significantly impact the performance of the communication system and lead to degraded signal quality, reduced coverage, and compromised safety [221]. To address this challenge, researchers are exploring various interference mitigation techniques such as adaptive power control, interference cancellation, frequency hopping, AI based interference predictions, and beamforming. Adaptive power control adjusts the transmission power of the communication signal to reduce interference while ensuring reliable communication [222]. Interference cancellation techniques use advanced signal processing algorithms to eliminate or mitigate the effects of interference. Frequency hopping techniques dynamically change the transmission frequency to avoid interference from other wireless systems [223]. Beamforming techniques use advanced antenna arrays to focus the transmission and reception of the signal in specific directions by the help of AI techniques [224], reducing interference from other directions.

However, these interference mitigation techniques have their limitations and trade-offs. For example, adaptive power control can impact the system's reliability, while interference cancellation techniques can be computationally expensive and require accurate channel information. Frequency hopping can increase latency, while beamforming requires precise knowledge of the user's location and direction. Moreover, interference management in CV2X communication systems requires coordination and cooperation among the different stakeholders, including vehicle manufacturers, infrastructure providers, and wireless carriers.

## 9.2. Channel Estimation

Channel estimation refers to the process of estimating the characteristics of the wireless channel between the transmitter and receiver, such as signal strength, delay, and Doppler shift. Accurate channel estimation is essential to ensure reliable and efficient communication in C-V2X. In the case of C-V2X, channel estimation faces several challenges. First, the wireless channel characteristics can vary rapidly due to the high mobility of vehicles, making accurate channel estimation challenging. Second, the C-V2X communication system operates in a complex and dynamic environment with numerous interfering signals and multi-path propagation. This makes the estimation of the wireless channel characteristics more challenging. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring various channel estimation techniques, such as pilotbased channel estimation, channel tracking, and channel prediction
[225]. Pilot-based channel estimation uses known pilot symbols transmitted along with the data to estimate the channel characteristics. Channel tracking uses feedback from the receiver to adjust the channel estimates in real-time based on the changing channel conditions. Channel prediction uses machine learning algorithms to predict the future channel conditions based on past observations [226].

Possible solutions for channel estimation in the future may include the use of advanced antenna technologies, such as massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and beamforming, to improve the estimation of the wireless channel characteristics
[227]. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms can also improve the accuracy and efficiency of channel estimation by leveraging historical data and predicting future channel conditions. Additionally, the development of standardized and accurate channel models can help improve the estimation of the wireless channel characteristics in C-V2X.

## 9.3. Challenges Behind The Edge And Cloud Ai Adoption In C-V2X

One of the significant research challenges in edge and cloud AI
for C-V2X is developing models that can effectively process and analyze heterogeneous data generated by different vehicles and infrastructure. The models must be efficient and lightweight to ensure they can run in real-time and not negatively impact the communication system's performance. Another challenge is ensuring the privacy and security of data processed by edge and cloud AI models. The models may process sensitive information, such as the location and behavior of vehicles, which could be exploited by attackers [228]. Therefore, researchers need to develop secure and privacy-preserving AI models and algorithms that can process data while preserving the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information. Moreover, integrating edge and cloud AI with the underlying communication system is another challenge. This integration must be seamless and transparent, ensuring minimal impact on the communication system's performance and reliability. Possible solutions for edge and cloud AI in the future may include the development of efficient and lightweight AI models and algorithms optimized for edge and cloud devices. Researchers can explore the use of federated learning, which involves training AI models on distributed edge and cloud devices [229], to help enhance the performance and privacy of edge and cloud AI in C-V2X communication. Furthermore, the use of hybrid edge and cloud computing architectures, such as fog computing, can help optimize the performance and efficiency of edge and cloud AI in C-V2X communication [230–232]. Additionally, researchers can explore the integration of edge and cloud AI with blockchain technology to enhance the security and privacy of data processed by these models.

## 9.4. Challenges Behind The Integration Of Network Slicing For C-V2X

Network slicing is another significant research challenge. As we know, Network slicing refers to the partitioning of a single physical network into multiple virtual networks, each with different characteristics and service requirements. This allows network resources to be allocated dynamically based on the specific requirements of each virtual network. In the case of C-V2X, network slicing can be used to support diverse services and applications with different quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as low latency and high reliability [233–235]. For example, safety-critical applications such as collision avoidance require high reliability and low latency, while infotainment applications such as streaming video may require high bandwidth. However, the implementation of network slicing in C-V2X faces several challenges. First, the design and configuration of network slices require accurate and timely information about the network conditions and the service requirements of each application. This requires efficient and reliable data collection and analysis mechanisms. Second, the allocation of network resources to different network slices must be dynamic and adaptive, based on the changing network conditions and service requirements. This requires advanced algorithms for resource management and optimization with the state-of-the-art AI mechanisms.

## 9.5. Security

One of the primary security challenges in C-V2X is ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between vehicles and infrastructure. The data transmitted may include sensitive information, such as the location of the vehicle, its speed, and its direction, which could be intercepted, modified, or spoofed by attackers. Additionally, attackers may launch denial-of-service attacks, such as jamming or flooding the network, which could cause severe disruptions to the communication system [236]. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring various security solutions, such as secure key management, encryption, digital signatures, and secure communication protocols. These solutions can help ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted in C-V2X communication. Another significant security challenge in C-V2X is ensuring the security of the underlying infrastructure, including the roadside units, cellular networks, and cloud servers. Attackers may attempt to compromise these systems and use them to launch attacks on C-V2X communication. To address this challenge, researchers are exploring secure architecture designs with edge and cloud AI, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and security management frameworks [237–239].

Furthermore, the standardization of security protocols and mechanisms is essential to ensure the interoperability and security of C-V2X communication across different vendors and systems.

Possible solutions for security in the future may include the use of advanced cryptographic algorithms and secure hardware modules to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted in C-V2X communication. The use of machine learning and AI algorithms for intrusion detection and prevention can help enhance the security of the underlying infrastructure. Additionally, the development of secure communication protocols and standards can help ensure the interoperability and security of C-V2X communication across different vendors and systems [240,241].

## 9.6. Other Research Challenges

In addition to the aforementioned research challenges, there are several other obstacles that need to be addressed to ensure the successful implementation and adoption of C-V2X. These challenges include: 1. Scalability: With the growing number of connected vehicles, the vehicular network needs to be able to handle a large volume of data traffic. This requires scalable architectures and efficient resource management to ensure the network can operate effectively. Several works are ongoing with these issues, some of the interesting works done by authors are [242–246] 2.

Latency: The transmission of data between vehicles and infrastructure needs to be fast and reliable. Achieving low latency in vehicular networks is a major challenge due to the high mobility of vehicles and the need for real-time communication. Enhanced architectures and advanced AI models should be developed to dwell with the standard C-V2X architecture to improve the latency, some of the potential solutions related to latency was addressed in [247–250] were they use the concept of computation offloading, effective capacity prediction, Multi tier edge computing for c-v2x resource offloading and AI based probability detection methods for C-V2X. Other very important issue is 3. Power Consumption: As vehicular networks require a lot of power to operate, which can be a challenge in resource-constrained environments [83]. Developing energy-efficient solutions that minimize power consumption without compromising performance is important for the long-term sustainability of intelligent vehicular networks, several researchers are trying to find optimal solutions, some of the interesting recent studies are [251–259]. 9.7. Focus on V2X development and directions in terms of *industry* perspective The automotive industry verticals should prioritize several key areas in V2X development to enhance the overall ecosystem. These include the utilization of common standardization protocols to ensure interoperability among devices, as well as a robust security framework to safeguard against potential cyber threats. Infrastructure is also a critical component, as it provides the necessary network connectivity for V2X communication. Furthermore, testing and validation of V2X technology are necessary to ensure safety and reliability, while regulatory support can aid in establishing legal frameworks and guidelines for V2X deployment. Finally, collaboration among stakeholders is essential for promoting innovation, knowledge-sharing, and the development of effective solutions [260]. By focusing on these areas, the automotive industry can improve product quality, enhance economic growth, and provide safer and more efficient transportation solutions.
