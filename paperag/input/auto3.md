## Discussion Of Findings Impact Of Autonomous Vehicles On Urban Traffic And Planning.

The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is poised to significantly impact urban traffic and planning, encompassing technological, economic, and environmental dimensions. Understanding these impacts is crucial for urban planners, policymakers, and stakeholders in the transportation sector. The integration of AVs into urban traffic systems necessitates a reevaluation of existing traffic management strategies. A study by Iravani, Anderson and Bevan (2018) on rethinking traffic congestion solutions in cities highlights the potential of AVs to complement or disrupt current transport planning tools, such as land use measures, transportation demand management, and transportation system management (Title Unknown). AVs, with their advanced navigation and communication capabilities, can significantly alter traffic flow patterns, requiring innovative approaches to traffic congestion solutions. The effective use of these tools must be overhauled with the advent of automated mobility, necessitating policy recommendations for each tool. Additionally, new safety challenges posed by integrating AVs into traffic must be addressed, requiring advancements in traffic signal systems and road infrastructure. The economic implications of AVs are multifaceted. On one hand, AVs promise to reduce the overall cost of transportation by improving fuel efficiency and reducing the need for parking infrastructure. On the other hand, the initial cost of AV technology and the required infrastructure investments pose significant economic challenges. Katerinin and Sanzhapov (2019) discuss the optimization of traffic light regulation parameters on urban road networks to minimize negative environmental impacts, which also has economic implications. The integration of AVs into this optimization process could lead to more efficient traffic management, potentially reducing the economic burden of traffic congestion and associated environmental costs. AVs have the potential to significantly impact the urban environment, particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Rong et al. (2018) propose a continuum dynamic traffic assignment model for AVs in a polycentric urban city, considering the environmental impact of traffic emissions. This model includes the cost of CO emissions in the transportation cost, highlighting the potential of AVs to contribute to environmental sustainability. The shift towards AVs could lead to a decrease in vehicle emissions, contributing to cleaner and healthier urban environments. However, this transition also requires careful consideration of the environmental impact of manufacturing and disposing of AVs and their components. In summary, the impact of autonomous vehicles on urban traffic and planning is complex and multifaceted, encompassing technological, economic, and environmental considerations. The integration of AVs into urban transportation systems offers opportunities for improved traffic management, economic efficiency, and environmental sustainability. However, it also presents challenges that require innovative solutions and policy interventions.

The study suggests that while AVs can make cities smarter, safer, and more energy-efficient, they also complicate traffic management. Current tools and policies may become inefficient in the face of this new technology. The authors argue for the development and enforcement of new sets of rules and policies to protect cities and their citizens in the digital and automated era. This includes considering the impact of AVs on climate change and traffic conditions in densely urbanized city centers. The study highlights the importance of analyzing and prioritizing the impact of AV functionalities individually for each city and traffic situation. Ye et al. (2020) explore the intelligent management of on-street parking in the context of autonomous vehicles. The increasing connectivity between vehicles and infrastructure, coupled with the deployment of AVs, presents unique challenges and opportunities for on-street parking management. The study develops a simulation-optimization approach for intelligent curbside management, aiming to minimize average traffic delay by balancing curb lanes for driving or parking. The results demonstrate a decrease in traffic delay by 9%-27% compared to benchmark cases. This study indicates the interplay between curb parking and traffic management in the AV era, suggesting that intelligent curb management can be a crucial factor in optimizing urban traffic flow. In summary, the evolution and future of traffic management in the autonomous era require a holistic approach that encompasses technological innovation, policy development, and strategic planning. The integration of AVs into urban traffic systems offers opportunities for improved efficiency and safety. However, it also presents challenges that necessitate careful consideration and planning. As AV technology continues to advance, its impact on traffic management will become increasingly significant, shaping the future of urban mobility.

Visioning exercises and studies provide insights into how AVs could reshape urban landscapes, influencing everything from transportation policies to city design. Staricco et al. (2019) conducted a visioning exercise focusing on the impacts of AVs on the Italian city of Turin. Their study highlights how different forms of regulation of AV circulation and parking can impact the sustainability and livability of the city. The exercise involved a focus group and interviews with experts and stakeholders to validate three visions and assess their advisability and sustainability. The study underscores the importance of defining long-term visions and identifying transition paths to achieve the desired future with AVs. It also emphasizes the need for urban planners to lead this transition, considering the potential impacts on circulation, parking, and overall urban development. Narayani and Kumar (2021) explore the potential of AVs as a key to sustainable mobility and safe accessibility in future cities. Their study examines current trends and future predictions in technological advancements, focusing on the economic, environmental, and social impacts of AVs. The research includes optimization models and simulations to understand future trends and the scope of autonomous mobility. The study acknowledges the criticisms and technical constraints associated with AVs but suggests that further investigation in this domain will be instrumental in developing a vision focused on AVs as a key to sustainable mobility in future urban planning. Gavanas (2019) analyzes the challenges posed by the implementation of autonomous road vehicles for passenger transport in European cities. The paper is based on a systematic review of research and policy, identifying challenges related to urban development, policy priorities, lack of data for planning, and the potential for AVs to be used as data sources by planners. The study concludes that addressing these challenges is essential for the full exploitation of AVs' potential to promote sustainable urban development. It highlights the need for urban planners to consider the possible impacts of AVs on cities and future challenges for urban planning.

(2022) discuss the need for sustainable investment strategies in smart cities, particularly in the context of urban mobility and autonomous vehicles. The study develops a simulation-based comparison between different cities and AV adoption scenarios to understand which aspects of cities lead to positive AV implementation outcomes. The analysis represents a first attempt to explore the impact of AVs on a large scale across different cities worldwide. The paper suggests that promoting AV-shuttle use in certain city archetypes could deliver significant advantages in terms of improvements in key performance indicators (KPIs). The study underscores the importance of aligning emerging technologies with long-term sustainability strategies in urban mobility. Kovacic, Mutavdžija, and Buntak (2022) provide a review and bibliometric analysis of the new paradigm of sustainable urban mobility, focusing on electric and autonomous vehicles. The research shows that while authors focus on the advantages and disadvantages of autonomous electric vehicles in the urban mobility system, there is an insufficient number of studies considering the need to plan the transition towards incorporating these vehicles into the urban system. The paper highlights the importance of developing a culture of sustainability among urban residents and planning the infrastructure transition to accommodate autonomous electric vehicles.
